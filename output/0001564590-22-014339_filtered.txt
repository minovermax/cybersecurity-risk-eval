Such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches and natural disasters.
In addition, security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including vandalism, catastrophic events and human error.
Our operations may further be impacted by security breaches that occur at third-party suppliers.
The impact of privacy breaches at service providers could also severely damage our business and reputation.
The facilities and systems of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to cyber-security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events.
The protection of our data, which includes both potential cyber-attacks as well as any potential failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations, could subject us to sanctions and damages and could harm our reputation and business.
In addition, information security threats, particularly cyber security threats, could pose risks to the security of our systems and networks, and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data.
As techniques used in cyber-attacks evolve, we may not be able to timely detect threats or anticipate and implement adequate security measures.
