We cannot assure you that the measures we take to prevent or hinder cyber-attacks and protect our systems, data, and user and customer information and to prevent outages, data, or information loss, fraud, and to prevent or detect security breaches, including a disaster recovery strategy for server and equipment failure and back-office systems and the use of third parties for certain cybersecurity services, will provide absolute security.
Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other cybersecurity risks or disruptions.
Furthermore, security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by third parties.
Breaches of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers or cybersecurity incidents could result in unauthorized access to our sites, networks, and systems; unauthorized access to and misappropriation of user information, including users’ personally identifiable information, or other confidential or proprietary information of ourselves or third parties; viruses, worms, spyware, or other malware being served from our sites, networks, or systems; deletion or modification of content or the display of unauthorized content on our sites; interruption, disruption, or malfunction of operations; costs relating to breach remediation, deployment of additional personnel and protection technologies, response to governmental investigations, and media inquiries and coverage; engagement of third-party experts and consultants; or litigation, regulatory action, and other potential liabilities.
In the past, we have experienced social engineering, phishing, malware, and similar attacks and threats of denial-of-service attacks, none of which to date has been material to our business; however, such attacks could in the future have a material adverse effect on our operations, business, and financial condition.
If any of these breaches of security should occur and be material, our reputation and brand could be damaged, our business may suffer, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to alleviate problems caused by such breaches, and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation, or regulatory action and possible liability.
We continue to devote significant resources to protect against security breaches or we may need to in the future to address problems caused by breaches, including notifying affected users in accordance with regulatory requirements and responding to any resulting litigation, which in turn, diverts resources from the growth and expansion of our business.
Some of the new requirements include:
● accountability and transparency requirements, which will require those who control data to demonstrate and record compliance and provide certain detailed information to users regarding the ways in which data is used and processed;
● enhanced data consent requirements, which includes “explicit” consent with regard to information the regulation classifies as sensitive data;
● obligations to consider data privacy as new products, services and systems are developed, including ways to limit accessibility of data as well as the amount of information collected, processed, and stored;
● constraints on using data to profile users;
● obligations to provide users with personal data in a usable format on request and to erase personal data in certain circumstances; and
● reporting to data protection authorities of potential breaches without undue delay (72 hours, where feasible).
We intend to make significant investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new technology, services, and systems or enhance our existing offerings, improve our operating infrastructure, enhance our information security systems to combat changing cyber threats, or implement more mature corporate and operating processes to support growth, and acquire complementary businesses, personnel and technologies.
We may not be able to detect the unauthorized use of our intellectual property, prevent breaches of our cybersecurity efforts, or take appropriate steps to enforce our proprietary or intellectual property rights effectively.
