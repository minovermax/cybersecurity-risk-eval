These risks could result in disruption of service, personal injury or loss of human life, damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or other environmental damage, breaches of our contractual commitments, and may result in curtailment or suspension of operations, which in turn could lead to significant costs and lost revenues.
These attacks could, among other things, target or impact our technology or mechanical systems that operate our distribution, transmission or storage facilities and result in a disruption in our operations, damage to our system and inability to meet customer requirements.
CYBERSECURITY RISK.
Therefore, an event caused by cyberattacks or other malicious act at an interconnected third party could impact our business and facilities similarly.
As these potential cyber security attacks become more common and sophisticated, we could be required to incur costs to strengthen our systems or obtain specific insurance coverage against potential losses.
Our businesses could experience breaches of security pertaining to sensitive customer, employee, and vendor information maintained by us in the normal course of business, which could adversely affect our reputation, diminish customer confidence, disrupt operations, materially increase the costs we incur to protect against these risks, and subject us to possible financial liability or increased regulation or litigation, any of which could adversely affect NW Holdings’ or NW Natural’s financial condition and results of operations.
