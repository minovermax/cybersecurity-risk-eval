A cyber-attack that bypasses our IS security causing an IS security breach may lead to a material disruption of our IS and/or the loss of business information, which could adversely affect our business.
Our results of operations could be adversely affected if our IS are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events, incur cyber-attacks or fail for any extended period of time.
