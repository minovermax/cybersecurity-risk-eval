Security or data breaches of our information processing systems may hurt our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Breaches in data security or infiltration of our network security by unauthorized persons could cause interruptions in operations and damage to our reputation.
Risks Relating to Intellectual Property and Cybersecurity
Our business depends on a strong brand, and any failure to maintain, protect and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to grow our business, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition.
Improper disclosure of confidential, personal or proprietary data, whether due to human error, misuse of information by employees or vendors, or as a result of cyberattacks, could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal liability or reputational harm, and could have an adverse effect on our business or operations.
Cybersecurity breaches, such as computer viruses, unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and similar incidents could disrupt the security of our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability to provide services to our clients and protect the privacy of their data, compromise confidential business information, result in intellectual property or other confidential or proprietary information being lost or stolen, including client, employee or company data, which could harm our competitive position or otherwise adversely affect our business.
Cyber threats are constantly evolving, which makes it more difficult to detect cybersecurity incidents, assess their severity or impact in a timely manner, and successfully defend against them.
For example, legislators in the U.S. are proposing new and more robust cybersecurity legislation in light of the recent broad-based cyberattacks at a number of companies.
