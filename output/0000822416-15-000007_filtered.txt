We may also be required to indemnify underwriters that purchased and securitized loans originated by a former subsidiary of Centex for losses incurred by investors in those securitized loans based on similar breaches of representations and warranties.
This guaranty provides that we will honor the potential repurchase obligations of Centexâ€™s mortgage operations related to breaches of similar representations in the origination of a certain pool of loans.
The resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, and could exceed existing estimates and accruals.
Information technology failures or data security breaches could harm our business.
