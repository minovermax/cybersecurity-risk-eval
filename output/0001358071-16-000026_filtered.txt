We are sometimes able to obtain contractual indemnification for preclosing liabilities, including environmental liabilities, but we generally acquire interests in properties on an “as is” basis with limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties.
Additionally, as an oil and natural gas producer, we may face various cybersecurity threats, including threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable, and there can be no assurance that our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring.
Cybersecurity breaches and information technology failures could harm our business by increasing our costs and negatively impacting our operations.
Although we have implemented information technology controls and systems that are designed to protect information and prevent or minimize the risk of data loss and other cybersecurity risks, such measures cannot entirely eliminate cybersecurity threats, and the enhanced controls we have installed may be breached or may fail.
If our information technology systems cease to function properly or our cybersecurity is breached, we could suffer disruptions to our operations and unauthorized persons may gain access to proprietary or confidential information, which could result in loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our or any of our customer’s or supplier’s data or confidential information; misuse or misappropriation of data, funds or other property; and other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks.
