Loss or corruption of our information or a cyberattack on our computer systems could adversely affect our business.
If any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure, whether due to cyberattack or otherwise, possible consequences include our loss of communication links and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities.
At the same time, cyberattacks have increased.
The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats.
Our technologies, systems and networks may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches.
Additionally, our insurance coverage for cyberattacks may not be sufficient to cover all the losses we may experience as a result of such cyberattacks.
