Disruptions to our or third-party information technology systems, including cyber-attacks and security breaches, and the costs of maintaining secure and effective information technology systems could negatively affect our business and results of operations.
Information systems are vulnerable to not functioning as designed and to disruptions and security breaches by computer hackers and cyber terrorists.
Although we continue to take actions to strengthen the security of our information technology systems, these measures and technology may not adequately anticipate or prevent security breaches in the future or we may not be able to timely implement these measures and technology.
Cyber-attacks are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect.
The failure to promptly detect, determine the extent of, appropriately respond to, and contain a significant data security attack or breach of our systems or any third-party systems used by us could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
