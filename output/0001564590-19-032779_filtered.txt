Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from weather events, power outages, telecommunications or computer failures, computer viruses, security breaches, employee errors and similar occurrences.
Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure and that of our service providers may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions.
Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated.
We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from any future breaches of our systems.
