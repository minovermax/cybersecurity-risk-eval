Cybersecurity Risks
If we are unable to secure customer, employee, vendor and company data, our systems could be compromised, our reputation could be damaged, and we could be subject to penalties or lawsuits.
Despite our procedures, technologies and other information security measures, we cannot be certain that our information technology systems or the information technology systems of our third-party service providers are preventing, containing, or detecting, or will be able to prevent, contain or detect all cyberattacks, cyberterrorism, or security breaches.
As evidenced by
other retailers who have suffered serious security breaches, we may be vulnerable to data security breaches and data loss, including cyberattacks.
