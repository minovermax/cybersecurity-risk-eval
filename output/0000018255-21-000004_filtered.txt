Our
information systems
and
those of our third-party service
providers are subject to ongoing
and persistent cybersecurity threats from
those seeking unauthorized access
through means which are
continually evolving and may be
difficult to
anticipate or detect for long periods
of time.
Our e-commerce platform
may also expose us to
greater potential for security or
data breaches involving the unauthorized access
to
or disclosure of customer information, as discussed
above under “A
security breach that
results in
unauthorized disclosure of employee, Company or customer information could
adversely affect our costs,
reputation and
results of
operations, and
efforts to
mitigate these
risks may
continue to
increase our
costs.” We
are also subject to risk related
to delays or failures in the
performance of third parties, such as
shipping companies,
including delays
associated with
labor strikes
or slowdowns
or adverse
weather
conditions.
