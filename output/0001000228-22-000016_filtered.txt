An extended period of modified business practices and remote work arrangements could have a negative impact on employee morale, strain our business continuity plans, introduce operational risk (including but not limited to cybersecurity risks), and impair our ability to efficiently operate our business;
â€¢ Significant changes in political conditions.
2019/1937 of 23 October 2019 on the protection of persons who report breaches of Union law, which was to be implemented by EU member states by December 17, 2021, organizes the legal protection of whistleblowers.
This Directive covers whistleblowers reporting breaches of certain EU laws, in particular as regards public health, the above-mentioned Directive No.
These information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious attack, which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns, and could involve claims against us by private parties and/or governmental agencies.
While we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the GDPR, CCPA, PIPL and CPRA requirements, our compliance with data privacy and cybersecurity laws is likely to impose additional costs on us, and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements, or changes in our practices in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
GENERAL RISKS
Security risks generally associated with our information systems and our technology products and services could materially adversely affect our business, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if such products, services or systems (or third-party systems we rely on) are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events, are subject to cyberattacks or fail for any extended period of time.
Information security risks have generally increased in recent years, and a cyberattack that bypasses our IS security systems (including third-party systems we rely on) causing an IS security breach may lead to a material disruption of our IS business systems (including third-party systems we rely on) and/or the loss of business information, as well as claims against us by affected parties and/or governmental agencies, and involve fines and penalties, costs for remediation, and substantial defense and settlement expenses.
In addition, we develop products and provide services to our customers that are technology-based, and a cyberattack that bypasses the IS security systems of our
products or services causing a security breach and/or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products or services could also cause significant loss of business and reputational harm, and actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies.
In addition, a cyberattack on a third-party that we use to manage a portion of our information systems could result in the same effects.
Additionally, legislative or regulatory action related to cybersecurity may increase our costs to develop or implement new technology products and services.
We have various insurance policies, including cybersecurity insurance, covering risks and in amounts that we consider adequate.
