LCNB’s information systems may experience an interruption, cyberattack, or other breach in security.
Any failure, interruption, cyberattack, or other breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in LCNB’s customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan, and other systems.
While LCNB has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption, cyberattack, or other security breach of its information systems, there can be no assurance that any such occurrences will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed.
The occurrence of any failures, interruptions, cyberattacks, or other security breaches of LCNB’s information systems could significantly disrupt LCNB's operations, allow misappropriation of LCNB's confidential information, allow misappropriation of customer confidential information, damage LCNB’s reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject LCNB to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose LCNB to significant civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.
