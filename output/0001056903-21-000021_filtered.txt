Security risks, data protection breaches and cyber-attacks could disrupt our internal operations, and any such disruption could increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price
There have been an increasing number of cyber-attacks on companies around the world, which have caused operational failures or compromised sensitive corporate or customer data.
We have implemented security measures and will continue to devote significant resources to improve our security posture to address any security vulnerabilities in an effort to prevent cyber-attacks.
Despite our efforts, due to the evolving nature of cyber-attacks and vulnerabilities, we cannot be assured that a cyber-attack will not cause water, wastewater or electric system problems, disrupt service to our customers, compromise important data or systems or result in unintended release of customer or employee information.
We maintain cybersecurity insurance to provide coverage for a portion of the losses and damages that may result from a security breach, but such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may not cover the total loss caused by a breach.
The market for cybersecurity insurance continues to evolve and may affect the future availability of cyber insurance at reasonable rates.
Among other things, the CCPA establishes statutory damages for victims of data security breaches, and provides additional rights for consumers to obtain their data from any business that has their personally identifying information.
