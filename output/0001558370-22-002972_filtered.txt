Those circumstances include:
● supply chain issues remain unresolved for longer than anticipated and decreased consumer and business confidence and economic activity, leading to certain lower loan demand and an increased risk of loan delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures;
● ratings downgrades, credit deterioration and defaults in many industries;
● volatility in financial and capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates;
● a reduction in the value of the assets that we manage or otherwise administer or service for others, affecting demand for our services;
● heightened cybersecurity, information security, and operational risks as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption resulting from the pandemic given increased online and remote activity, including as a result of work-from-home arrangements;
● disruptions to business operations experienced by counterparties and service providers;
● increased risk of business disruption if our employees are unable to work effectively because of illness, quarantines, government actions, failures in systems or technology that disrupt work-from-home arrangements, or other effects of the COVID-19 pandemic; and
● decreased demands for our products and services.
A Failure in or Breach of Our Operational or Security Systems or Infrastructure, or Those of Our Third Party Vendors and Other Service Providers, Including as a Result of Cyber-attacks, Could Disrupt Our Business, Result in the Disclosure or Misuse of Confidential or Proprietary Information, Damage Our Reputation, Increase Our Costs and Cause Losses
We depend upon our ability to process, record and monitor our client transactions on a continuous basis.
Information security risks for financial institutions such as ours have generally increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, activists and other external parties.
Although we have information security procedures and controls in place, our technologies, systems, networks and our clients’ devices may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of our or our clients’ confidential, proprietary and other information, or otherwise disrupt our or our clients’ or other third parties’ business operations.
We may also be adversely impacted by successful cyberattacks of our partners, third-party vendors and others in our supply chain with whom we conduct business or share information.
These attacks may take a variety of forms, including web application attacks, denial of service attacks, ransomware, other malware, and social engineering, including phishing.
Information security incidents may also occur due to the failure to control access to, and use of, sensitive systems or information by our workforce, with a potential increase in this threat due to the increase in remote work.
The failure of our controls (such as policies, procedures, security controls and monitoring, automation and backup plans) designed to prevent, or limit the effect of, failure, inadvertent use or abuse could result in disruptions or breaches beyond our control.
Although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber-attacks or other information security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future.
Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and clients, or cyberattacks or security breaches of the networks, systems or devices that our clients use to access our products and services could result in significant legal and financial exposure, client attrition, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs and/or additional compliance costs, a loss of confidence in the security of our systems, any of which may not be covered by insurance and could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
In addition, in 2017, the NYDFS established comprehensive cybersecurity requirements for financial services companies, including us.
Similar legislation is being enacted around the world with requirements and protections specific to data security requirements, notification requirements for data breaches, the right to access personal data and the right to be forgotten.
