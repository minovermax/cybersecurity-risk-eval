Cyber breaches, acts of war or terrorism, grid disturbances or security breaches involving the misappropriation of confidential and proprietary customer, employee, financial or system operating information could negatively impact our business.
Cyber breaches, acts of war or terrorism or grid disturbances resulting from internal or external sources could target our generation, transmission and distribution facilities or our information technology systems.
We routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems.
Although such attempts have not resulted in any material breaches, disruptions or loss of business - critical information, our systems and procedures for preparing and protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations.
Any such cyber breaches could result in a significant decrease in revenues, significant expense to repair system damage or security breaches, adversely impact our reputation, regulatory penalties and liability claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.
A physical attack on our transmission and distribution infrastructure could interfere with normal business operations and affect our ability to control our transmission and distribution assets.
