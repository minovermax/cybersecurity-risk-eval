Cybersecurity attacks are increasing in frequency and sophistication.
Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced threats.
These threats pose a risk to the security of our information technology systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data.
We have experienced cybersecurity events on the Company’s and certain of our affiliates’ networks and/or systems.
However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
