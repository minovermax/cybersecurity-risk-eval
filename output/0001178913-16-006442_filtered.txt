Failure in our information technology systems, including by cybersecurity attacks or other data security incidents, could significantly disrupt our operations.
Our information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptions.
It is possible that a cybersecurity attack might not be noticed for some period of time.
The occurrence of a cybersecurity attack or incident could result in business interruptions from the disruption of our information technology systems, or negative publicity resulting in reputational damage with our shareholders and other stakeholders and/or increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.
