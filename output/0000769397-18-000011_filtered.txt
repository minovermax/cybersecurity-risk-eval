Hackers regularly have targeted our systems, products, services and applications, and we expect them to do so in the future.
The risk of a security incident, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.
These threats include but are not limited to identity theft, unauthorized access, DNS attacks, wireless network attacks, viruses and worms, advanced persistent threat (APT), application centric attacks, peer-to-peer attacks, phishing, malicious file uploads, backdoor trojans and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.
Any of the foregoing could attack our systems, products or services.
Unauthorized access to this data may be obtained through break-ins, network breaches by unauthorized parties, employee theft or misuse, or other misconduct.
