We may experience operational problems with our information systems as a result of system failures, viruses, computer “hackers” or other causes.
Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our computer system and, if successful, misappropriate personal information, payment card or check information or confidential business information of our Company.
The retail industry in particular has been the target of recent cyber-attacks, which are becoming increasingly difficult to anticipate and prevent due to their rapidly evolving nature.
