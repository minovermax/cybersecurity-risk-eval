Our automated systems cannot be completely protected against events that are beyond our control, such as natural disasters, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches or hacking attacks.
Although we use these security measures to protect this customer information, a compromise of our physical or network security systems through a cyber-security attack would create the risk that our customersâ€™ personal information might be obtained by unauthorized persons.
Cancellations or delays due to weather conditions, traffic control problems, and breaches in security could harm our operating results and financial condition.
