We have put in place security measures to protect ourselves against cyber-based attacks and disaster recovery plans for our critical systems.
However, if our information technology systems are breached, damaged, or cease to function properly due to any number of causes, such as catastrophic events, power outages, security breaches, or cyber-based attacks, and our disaster recovery plans do not effectively mitigate on a timely basis, we may encounter disruptions that could interrupt our ability to manage our operations and suffer damage to our reputation, which may adversely impact our revenues, operating results and financial condition.
