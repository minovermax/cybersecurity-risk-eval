The Company’s business could be negatively affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and other disruptions.
In particular, the Company’s implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for the Company’s information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs.
Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring.
If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to the Company’s operations and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
