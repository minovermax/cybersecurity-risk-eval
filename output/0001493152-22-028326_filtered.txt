We are increasingly dependent on information technology, and potential cyberattacks, security problems or other disruption and expanding social media vehicles present new risks.
Our networks and storage applications could be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or others through cyberattacks, which are rapidly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated, or by other means, or may be breached due to operator error, malfeasance or other system disruptions.
