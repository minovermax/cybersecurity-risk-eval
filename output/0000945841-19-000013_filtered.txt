Our ability to operate effectively on a day-to-day basis and accurately report our results depends on a solid technological infrastructure, which is inherently susceptible to internal and external threats.
We are vulnerable to interruption by fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunication failures, internet failures, security breaches and other catastrophic events.
We have designed numerous procedures and protocols to mitigate cybersecurity risks.
In the event a cybersecurity threat occurs, we have processes in place to timely notify the appropriate personnel for assessment and resolution.
