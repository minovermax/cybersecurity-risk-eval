A cyber attack or other security breach of our Financial Services business could subject us to significant liability and harm our reputation.
General Risk Factors
We are subject to several other risks of which other public companies are subject, including without limitation, the effect of negative publicity; information technology failures or data security breaches; our ability to change our operational policies, investment guidelines and business and growth strategies without stockholder consent; and our ability to maintain an effective system of internal controls.
Any cyber attack or other security breach of or vulnerability in our technology systems, or those of our customers or other third-party vendors we rely on, especially with respect to our Financial Services business, could have operational impacts, subject us to significant liability and harm our reputation.
There have been several highly publicized cases involving financial services companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of customer or other confidential information in recent years, as well as cyber attacks involving theft, dissemination and destruction of corporate information or other assets, in some cases as a result of failure to follow procedures by employees or contractors or as a result of actions by third parties.
Notwithstanding the precautions we take, if a cyber attack or other information security breach were to occur, especially with respect to our Financial Services business, this could jeopardize the information we confidentially maintain, or otherwise cause interruptions in our operations or those of our customers, exposing us to liability.
If any person, including any of our employees, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to customer or employee data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates such data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution.
Information technology failures or data security breaches could expose us to liability and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
Our information technology systems are dependent upon these providers, as well as global communications providers, telephone systems and other aspects of the Internet infrastructure, which have experienced significant systems failures and electrical outages in the past, and are susceptible to damage or interruption from fire, floods, power outages, or telecommunications failures, or cybersecurity threats such as computer viruses, break-ins, security breaches, and similar events.
As a result, we may be required to incur significant costs to remediate the damage caused by these disruptions or to prevent security breaches in the future.
While, to date, we have not had a significant cybersecurity breach or attack that had a material impact on our business or operating results, there can be no assurance that our efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information technology networks and related systems will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.
