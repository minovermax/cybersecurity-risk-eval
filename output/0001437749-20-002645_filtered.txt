We may also be required to incur significant costs to protect against damages caused by information technology failures or security breaches in the future.
We provide employee awareness training of cybersecurity threats and routinely utilize information technology consultants to assist us in our evaluations of the effectiveness of the security of our information technology systems, and we regularly enhance our security measures to protect our systems and data.
However, because methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade systems evolve frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these attacks or to implement adequate preventative measures.
In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data or system protection measure could be significant and our efforts to deter, identify, mitigate and/or eliminate any security breaches or incidents may not be successful.
