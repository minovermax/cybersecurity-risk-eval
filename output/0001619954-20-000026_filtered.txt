As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to further enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.
Such failures or breaches of our security measures, or our inability to effectively resolve such failures or breaches in a timely manner, could severely damage our reputation, adversely affect client or investor confidence in us, and reduce the demand for our services from existing and potential clients.
If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, or if we are unable to effectively resolve such breaches in a timely manner, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and clients, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial results.
Interruptions in service or damage to locations may be caused by natural disasters, power loss, Internet or network failures, physical damage, operator error, security breaches, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, or similar events.
In addition to the other risk factors included in this section, some of the important factors that may cause sequential quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in our operating results include:
•
seasonal variations driven primarily by regulatory timelines have historically caused a significantly higher proportion of our services to be performed, and therefore revenues and costs to be recognized, during the second and, to a lesser extent, the fourth quarters of the year compared to the first and, most significantly, the third quarter, (quarter to quarter financial performance may increasingly vary from historical seasonal trends as we further expand into adjacent markets and increase the portion of our revenue generated from new offerings);
•
possible delays in the expected recognition of revenue due to lengthy and sometimes unpredictable sales and implementation timelines;
•
the amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations, and infrastructure;
•
the timing and success of introductions of new applications and services by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, clients, or strategic partners;
•
the addition or loss of large clients, including through acquisitions or consolidations of such clients;
•
network outages or security breaches;
•
our ability to attract new clients;
•
general economic, industry, and market conditions;
•
client renewal rates and the timing and terms of client renewals;
•
changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;
•
the mix of applications and services sold during a period; and
•
the timing of expenses related to the development or acquisition of technologies or businesses.
