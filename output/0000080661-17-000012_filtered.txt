Our business could be materially adversely affected by a security breach or other attack involving our computer systems or the systems of one or more of our vendors.
All of these systems are subject to “cyber attacks” by sophisticated third parties with substantial computing resources and capabilities, and to unauthorized or illegitimate actions by employees, consultants, agents and other persons with legitimate access to our systems.
Therefore, the occurrence of a security breach, data loss or corruption, or cyber-attack, if sufficiently severe, could have a material adverse effect on our business results, prospects, and liquidity.
