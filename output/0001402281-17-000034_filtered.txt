The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats.
Deliberate attacks on, or unintentional events affecting, our systems or infrastructure or the systems or infrastructure of third parties could lead to corruption or loss of our proprietary data and potentially sensitive data, delays in production or delivery of oil or natural gas, difficulty in completing and settling transactions, challenges in maintaining our books and records, environmental damage, communication interruptions, other operational disruptions and third-party liability.
Although historically we have not incurred material expenditures for protective measures related to potential cyber-attacks, as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks.
