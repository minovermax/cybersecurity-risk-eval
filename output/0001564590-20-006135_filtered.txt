Our IT is vulnerable to cyberattacks, computer viruses, worms and other malicious software programs, physical and electronic break-ins, sabotage and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems.
However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, we could potentially be subject to downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or personal information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.
Breaches in data security or incidents of cybercrime could damage our customers’ business and our reputation, which may harm our ability to gain new customers or cause our existing customer to look to our competitors for products and services.
Our products and services involve the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary data and personal information, and security breaches could result in a risk of loss of this data or information, litigation and possible liability.
While we have security measures in place, they may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our IT systems, our customers’ data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information.
Malicious third parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our products and services.
