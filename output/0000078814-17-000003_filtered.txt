If we are unable to protect our information technology systems against service interruptions, misappropriation of data, or breaches of security resulting from cyberattacks or other events, or we encounter other unforeseen difficulties in the operation of our information technology systems, our operations could be disrupted, our reputation may be harmed and we could be subject to legal liability or regulatory enforcement action.
In today's environment there are numerous risks to cybersecurity and privacy, including individual and groups of criminal hackers, industrial espionage, employee errors and/or malfeasance and technological errors.
These cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them.
However, there is no guarantee that these security measures will prevent or detect the unauthorized access by experienced computer programmers, hackers or others.
Successful breaches could, among other things, result in the unauthorized disclosure, theft and misuse of company, client, consumer and employee sensitive and confidential information, disrupt the performance of our information technology systems and deny services to our clients.
Our systems are also subject to adverse acts of nature, computer viruses, vandalism, power loss, computer or communications failures and other unexpected events.
