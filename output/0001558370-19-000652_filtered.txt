Cybersecurity and Data Privacy - Security breaches could disrupt the Company’s business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and have a material adverse effect on its business, reputation and results of operations.
The Company has been subject to cyberattacks in the past, including phishing and malware incidents, and although no such attack has had a material adverse effect on its business, this may not be the case with future attacks.
As the prevalence of cyberattacks continues to increase, the Company’s IT systems, or those of third parties, may be subject to increased security threats and the Company may incur additional costs to upgrade and maintain its security measures in place to prevent and detect such threats.
The Company’s security measures may be unable to prevent certain security breaches, and any such breaches could result in transactional errors, business disruptions, loss of or damage to intellectual property, loss of customers and business opportunities, unauthorized access to or disclosure of confidential or personal information (which could cause a breach of applicable data protection legislation), regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, and additional compliance costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The security and privacy measures the Company’s vendors implement may not be sufficient to prevent and detect cyberattacks that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
While the Company’s IT vendor agreements typically contain provisions that seek to eliminate or limit the Company’s exposure to liability for damages from a cyberattack, the Company cannot assure that such provisions will withstand legal challenges or cover all or any such damages.
If
the Company’s business continuity and/or disaster recovery plans do not effectively and timely resolve issues resulting from a cyberattack, the Company may suffer material adverse effects on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
