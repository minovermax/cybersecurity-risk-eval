Interruptions in our operational systems or successful cyber security attacks on any of our systems could adversely impact our operations, our ability to report financial results and our business.
Any cyber security attack that affects our facilities, our systems, our customers or any of our financial data could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We have experienced cyber security threats such as viruses and attacks targeting our systems, and expect the frequency and sophistication of such incidents to continue to grow.
While we have taken steps to mitigate persistent and continuously evolving cyber security threats by implementing network security and internal control measures, implementing policies and procedures for managing risk to our information systems, periodically testing our information technology systems, and conducting employee training on cyber security, there can be no assurance that a system or network failure or data security breach would not adversely affect our business.
Furthermore, the continuing and evolving threat of cyber-attacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention.
