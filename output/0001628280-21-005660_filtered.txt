While the Company does maintain both redundancy and disaster recovery protocols, any changes in third-party service levels at our data centers or any security breaches, errors, defects, disruptions, or other performance problems with our Thryv platform and add-ons could adversely affect our reputation, damage our clients’ stored files, result in lengthy interruptions in our services, or otherwise result in damage or losses to our clients for which they may seek compensation from us.
In addition, most states and some foreign governments have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of PII.
Furthermore, we and our clients in the healthcare industry are regulated by HIPAA, which establishes privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of protected health information (“PHI”) and requires the implementation of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of individually identifiable health information in electronic form, as well as breach notification procedures for breaches of PHI and penalties for violation of HIPAA’s requirements for entities subject to its regulation.
These concerns about information security increase with the mounting sophistication of social engineering.
Our network security hardening may be bypassed by phishing and other social engineering techniques that seek to use end-user behaviors to distribute computer viruses and malware into our systems, which might disrupt our delivery of services and make them unavailable and might also result in the disclosure or misappropriation of PII or other confidential or sensitive information.
The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security.
We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period of time.
We face risk of litigation, regulatory investigations and similar actions in the ordinary course of our business, including the risk of lawsuits and other legal actions relating to breaches of contractual obligations or tortious claims from clients or other third parties, fines, penalties, interest, or other damages as a result of erroneous transactions, breach of data privacy laws, or lawsuits and legal actions related to us or our predecessors.
Furthermore, the availability or performance of our Thryv platform and add-ons could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including clients’ inability to access the internet, the failure of our network or software systems, security breaches, or variability in user traffic for our services.
