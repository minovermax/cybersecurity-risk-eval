A failure or outage in our operational systems or cyber security attacks on any of our systems, or those of third parties, may adversely affect our financial results.
Any cyber security attack that affects our facilities, our systems, our customers and any of our financial data could have a material adverse effect on our business.
In addition, a cyber-attack on our customer and employee data may result in a financial loss, including potential fines for failure to safeguard data, and may damage our reputation.
We have experienced cybersecurity threats to our information technology infrastructure and have experienced cyber-attacks, attempts to breach our systems and other similar incidents.
Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to cyber-attacks or disruptions resulting from such events.
We may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of information security breaches or to respond to or alleviate problems caused by such breaches.
A cybersecurity attack could also be directed at our systems and result in interruptions in our operations or delivery of services to our clients and their customers.
To reduce organizational risk from cybersecurity threats, we carry cyber liability insurance and have undertaken several initiatives in recent years.
