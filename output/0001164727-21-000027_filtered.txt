Our information systems, and those of our third-party service providers and vendors, may be targeted by increasingly sophisticated threat actors.
Cybersecurity risk is increasingly difficult to identify and quantify and cannot be fully mitigated because of the rapidly evolving nature of the threats, targets and consequences.
Although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches, disruptions, or loss of business-critical information, our systems and procedures for preparing and protecting against such attempts and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient against future attacks.
Given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions.
In addition, as technologies evolve and these cybersecurity attacks become more sophisticated, we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate preventive measures or mitigating potential harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.
For instance, we review our cybersecurity controls against current industry threats and partner with security vendors to assist with protecting our network and data resources through activities such as penetration and vulnerability testing, assessments against current cybersecurity standards, and leveraging industry recommendations from both independent vendors as well as industry partners.
Such efforts may incur significant costs and yet prove insufficient to deter future cybersecurity attacks or prevent all security breaches.
As such, our corporate policies and processes may not prevent or detect all potential breaches of law or other governance practices.
