In addition, any significant disruption relating to our current information technology systems, whether resulting from such things as fire, flood, tornado and other natural disasters, power loss, network failures, loss of data, security breaches and computer viruses, or otherwise, may have an adverse effect on our business, our operating results and our ability to report our financial performance in a timely manner.
A number of other companies have publicly disclosed breaches of their security, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their networks.
We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches.
Security breaches, including any breach related to us or the parties with which we have commercial relationships, could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss, litigation, and possible liability.
