•Risks relating to our operations, such as those associated with mining and other conditions beyond our control, decreased demand for coal, the complexity of mining in Central Appalachia, disruptions in transportation services, the availability of skilled workers, product specification requirements, higher than estimated employee benefit, property reclamation or mine closure costs, the availability of coal reserves, unionization, cybersecurity, our dependence upon third parties and our ability to make capital investments.
Adverse operating conditions and events that we have experienced in the past and/or may experience in the future include:
•changes or variations in geologic, hydrologic or other conditions, such as the thickness of the coal deposits and the amount of rock, clay or other non-coal material embedded in or overlying the coal deposit;
•mining, processing and loading equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems;
•limited availability or increased costs of mining, processing and loading equipment and parts and other materials from suppliers;
•difficulties associated with mining under or around surface obstacles;
•unfavorable conditions with respect to proximity to and availability, reliability and cost of transportation facilities;
•adverse weather and natural disasters, such as heavy snows, heavy rains and flooding, lightning strikes, hurricanes or earthquakes;
•accidental mine water discharges, coal slurry releases and failures of an impoundment or refuse area;
•mine safety accidents, including fires and explosions from methane and other sources;
•hazards or occurrences that could result in personal injury and loss of life;
•a shortage of skilled and unskilled labor;
•security breaches or terroristic acts;
•strikes and other labor-related interruptions;
•delays or difficulties in, the unavailability of, or unexpected increases in the cost of acquiring, developing or permitting new acquisitions from the federal government and other new mining reserves and surface rights;
•competition and/or conflicts with other natural resource extraction activities and production within our operating areas;
•the termination of material contracts by state or other governmental authorities; and
•fatalities, personal injuries or property damage arising from train derailments, mined material or overburden leaving permit boundaries, underground mine blowouts, impoundment failures, subsidence or other unexpected incidents.
Cybersecurity attacks, natural disasters, terrorist attacks and other similar crises or disruptions may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, or those of our customers and suppliers.
Our business, or the businesses of our customers and suppliers, may be impacted by disruptions such as cybersecurity attacks or failures, threats to physical security, and extreme weather conditions or other natural disasters.
Strategic targets, such as energy-related assets, may be at greater risk of future terrorist or cybersecurity attacks than other targets in the U.S.
Further, as cybersecurity attacks continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cybersecurity attacks.
