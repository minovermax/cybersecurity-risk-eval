These may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or other events or disruptions.
However, complete failure of all local public power and backup generators, impairment of all telecommunications lines, a concerted denial of service cyber-attack, a significant data breach, damage, injury or impairment (environmental, accidental, intentional or pandemic) to the buildings, the equipment inside the buildings housing our data centers, the personnel operating such facilities or the customer data contained therein, or errors by the personnel trained to operate such facilities could cause a disruption in operations and negatively impact customers who depend on us for data center and system support services.
We face the possibility of damages resulting from internal and external security breaches.
In addition, the other systems with which we may interface, such as the Internet and related systems may be vulnerable to security breaches, viruses, programming errors, or similar disruptive problems.
The effect of these security breaches and related issues could disrupt our ability to perform certain key business functions and could potentially reduce demand for our services.
