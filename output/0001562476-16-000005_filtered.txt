Information technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business.
In addition, breaches of our data security systems, including by cyber-attacks, could result in the unintended public disclosure or the misappropriation of proprietary, personal and confidential information (including confidential information about our employees, consumers who view our homes, homebuyers, mortgage loan borrowers and business partners), and require us to incur significant expense to address and resolve these kinds of issues.
