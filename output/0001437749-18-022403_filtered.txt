Information technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business.
Our computer systems, including our backup systems, and those of the third-parties on whose systems we rely, are subject to damage or interruption from computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, power outages, security breaches (including through data-theft and cyber-attack), usage errors by our associates and catastrophic events, such as fires, floods, hurricanes and tornadoes.
Further, we are continuously working to develop and maintain our systems and protect them from the threats enumerated above.
