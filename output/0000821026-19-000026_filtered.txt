The Company's information technology systems may impose limitations or failures, or may face external threats, which may affect the Company's ability to conduct its business.
As with all companies, these security measures are subject to third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularities.
Despite the security measures the Company has in place, its facilities and systems, and those of its third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming or human errors, or other similar events.
