While, to date, we have not been subject to cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents which, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to our operations or financial condition, the preventive actions we and our third-party service providers and contract partners take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect information technology resources and networks may be insufficient to repel a major cyber-attack in the future.
