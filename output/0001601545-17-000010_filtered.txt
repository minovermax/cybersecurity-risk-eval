While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption, or security breach of our information systems, we cannot assure you that any such failures, interruptions, or security breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately rectified.
The occurrence of any failures, interruptions, or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, cause us to incur costs of rectification, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
