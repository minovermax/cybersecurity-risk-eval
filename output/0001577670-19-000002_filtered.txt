Cybersecurity threats or other security breaches could compromise sensitive information belonging to us or our employees, borrowers, clients and other counterparties and could harm our business and our reputation and subject us to regulatory scrutiny.
Ladder Capital relies on the efficacy of its cybersecurity policies and processes in order to protect its data assets from cyberattacks and intrusions, including computer viruses, adware, phishing/social engineering, wire fraud, ransomware and unauthorized persons accessing our data assets internally or externally.
The rise of high profile security breaches by hackers, foreign governments, and other malicious actors indicates an increased risk of a security breach or IT disruption.
Despite our security measures, like most companies, our information technology and infrastructure has been and likely will continue to be subject to attacks by hackers, or may be breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions that could result in unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive information.
Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to networks, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures against all forms of attack.
Furthermore, in the operation of our business we also use third-party vendors that store certain sensitive data, including confidential information about our employees, and these third parties are subject to their own cybersecurity threats.
