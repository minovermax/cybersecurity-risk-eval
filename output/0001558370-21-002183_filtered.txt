Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other cyber-security developments may result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect user transaction data and cyber-security attacks are becoming more sophisticated.
Cyber-security risks such as malicious software and attempts to gain unauthorized access to data are rapidly evolving and could lead to disruptions in our network, unauthorized release of personally identifiable, confidential or otherwise protected information or corruption of data.
We have incurred costs and may need to expend significant additional resources to appropriately protect against security breaches, implement processes to adequately respond to security breaches (including as may be required by applicable law, such as the GDPR), or to address problems caused by breaches.
Both unsuccessful and successful “cyber-attacks” on companies have continued to increase in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years.
While we develop and maintain systems seeking to prevent systems-related events and security breaches from occurring, the development and maintenance of these systems is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as techniques used in such attacks become more sophisticated and change frequently.
Moreover, the amount and scope of insurance, if any, that we maintain against losses resulting from any such events or security breaches may not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that may result.
