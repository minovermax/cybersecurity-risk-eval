In addition, any association or perceived association between our equipment or services and such attacks or accidents would likely have an adverse effect on demand for our equipment and services.
The uninterrupted operations and services of our Connectivity segment depend upon the extent to which our equipment and the equipment of our third-party network providers is protected against damage from fire, flood, earthquakes, power loss, solar flares, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, break-ins, acts of war or terrorism and similar events or factors beyond our control.
Our business and reputation could be materially harmed as a result of data breaches, data theft, unauthorized access or hacking.
An increasing number of companies have disclosed breaches of their security, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on their computer networks.
Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate such threatening techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures to protect our business from cyber and similar unauthorized attacks on our information technology systems.
