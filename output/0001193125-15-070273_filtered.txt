We face cybersecurity and similar risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information, disruption of our programming services, damage to our brands and reputation, legal exposure and financial losses
Our online, mobile and app offerings, as well as our internal systems, involve the storage and transmission of our and our usersâ€™ proprietary information, and we and our partners rely on various technology systems in connection with the production and distribution of our programming.
Although we monitor our security measures regularly, they may be breached due to employee error, computer malware, viruses, hacking and phishing attacks or otherwise.
