Like those of many large businesses, certain of our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, phishing efforts, denial-of-service attacks and other cyber attacks and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks become more sophisticated and frequent.
Attacks perpetrated against our information systems could result in loss of assets and critical information and expose us to remediation costs and reputational damage.
Cyber attacks could further adversely affect our ability to operate facilities, information technology and business systems, or compromise confidential customer and employee information.
