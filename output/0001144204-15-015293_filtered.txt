The Company’s retail segment, including its internet business, is subject to the risk of data loss and security breaches.
Failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches, including breaches of Company technology and systems, could expose the Company or its customers to a risk of loss or misuse of such information, adversely affect the Company’s operating results, result in litigation or potential liability for the Company, and otherwise harm the Company’s business and/or reputation.
Although the Company has developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including systems and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third party vendor, such measures cannot provide absolute security.
