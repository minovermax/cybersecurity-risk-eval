Causes of supply disruptions may include natural disasters (including hurricanes and other extreme weather), industrial accidents, scheduled production outages, producer breaches of contract, producer disruptions, high demand leading to difficulties allocating appropriate quantities, port closures and other transportation disruptions and other circumstances beyond our control.
Our systems are aging and susceptible to malfunctions, lack of support, interruptions (including due to equipment damage, power outages, computer viruses and a range of other hardware, software and network problems) and we may experience such malfunctions, interruptions or security breaches in the future.
Our business could be negatively affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats to us, and other disruptions.
We are continuously working to improve our ability to respond and recover from potential security threats through technological improvements and employee awareness training around cyber risks.
In responding to these risks, we continue to implement various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information, facilities and infrastructure which may result in increased capital and operating costs.
There can be no assurance that such procedures, controls, and intelligence will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring.
If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows and could result in claims being brought against us.
In addition, if any information about our customers and producers retained by us were the subject of a successful cybersecurity attack against us, we could be subject to litigation or other claims by the affected customers and producers.
