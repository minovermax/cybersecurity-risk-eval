Although the Company believes that it has robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place, as cyber threats continue to evolve, it may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance its information security measures and investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.
In particular, the unionization of the Company’s employees could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects because:
•restrictive work rules could hamper the Company’s efforts to improve and sustain operating efficiency and could impair the Company’s service reputation and limit the Company’s ability to provide next-day services;
•a strike or work stoppage could negatively impact the Company’s profitability and could damage customer and employee relationships, and some shippers may limit their use of unionized trucking companies because of the threat of strikes and other work stoppages; and
•an election and bargaining process could divert management’s time and attention from the Company’s overall objectives and impose significant expenses.
