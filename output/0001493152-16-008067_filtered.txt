Breaches of data security could significantly impact our business.
We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches.
Our security measures are designed to protect against security breaches, but our failure to prevent such security breaches could cause us to incur significant expense to investigate and respond to a security breach and correct any problems caused by any breach, subject us to liability, damage our reputation and diminish the value of our brand-name.
Moreover, third parties are engaging in increased cyber-attacks and other data theft efforts, and individuals are increasingly subjected to theft of identity, medical or credit card or other financial account information.
In addition to risks we face from cyber attacks or data theft efforts directly targeted at our systems, we offer our products, services and solutions to companies, such as healthcare or financial institutions, under contracts which may expose us to significant liabilities for data breaches or losses which could arise out of or result from products, services or solutions we may sell to these institutions.
There is a risk that we may fail to prevent such data theft or data breaches and that our customers or others may assert claims against us as a result.
Enforcement actions, which may or may not be based upon actual cyber attacks or other breaches in data security, present an ongoing risk to us, could result in a loss of customers, damage to our reputation and monetary damages.
Widespread use of the Internet could decline as a result of disruptions, computer viruses, data security threats, privacy issues or other damage to Internet servers or usersâ€™ computers.
