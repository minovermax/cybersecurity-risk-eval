The risks and uncertainties that come with a digital presence include competition from more established competitors in the marketplace, responding quickly to consumer traffic patterns, supporting demand outside our
current distribution channels, and additional cybersecurity risks.
Our business depends on information technology systems and digital capabilities that are implemented in a manner intended to minimize the risk of a cybersecurity breach or other such threat, including the misappropriation of assets or other sensitive information or data corruption, which could cause operational disruption.
We cannot guarantee that our cybersecurity measures will completely prevent others from obtaining unauthorized access to our enterprise network, system and data.
If we are the target of a cybersecurity attack resulting in unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential data, we may be required to execute costly notification procedures.
In addition, catastrophic events, or the threat thereof, can adversely affect U.S. and world economies, and could result in delayed or lost sales of our products.
