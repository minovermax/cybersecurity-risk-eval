We face risks related to the storage of our clients’ and their customers’ confidential and proprietary information, including risks related to cyber-security and security breaches.
As a result, we face risks related to accidental or willful security breaches (including unauthorized access to this data), which could expose us to liability for the loss or misuse of such information, time-consuming and expensive litigation and other possible liabilities as well as negative publicity.
Our servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar disruptions, including “denial-of-service” type attacks.
Regulatory inquiries or investigations, data security breaches, lawsuits, employee misconduct, perceptions of conflicts of interest and rumors, among other developments, could substantially damage our reputation, even if they are baseless or satisfactorily addressed.
We may also need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches.
