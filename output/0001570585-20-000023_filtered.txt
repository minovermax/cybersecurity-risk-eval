Failure in our or third-party technology or telecommunications systems, leakage of sensitive customer data, or security breaches could significantly disrupt our operations, reduce our customer base and result in fines, litigation or lost revenue.
Moreover, despite security measures, unauthorized parties may gain access to or disrupt our or our third-party service providers’ servers, systems and equipment by, among other things, hacking into our servers, systems and equipment or those of our third-party service providers through fraud, computer viruses, worms, phishing, physical or electronic break-ins or burglaries, or errors by our or our third-party service providers’ employees.
In addition, as discussed further below, the security measures and procedures we and our third-party service providers have in place to protect personal data and other information may not be sufficient to counter all data security breaches, cyber-attacks, or system failures.
Further, although we devote significant resources to our cybersecurity programs and have implemented security measures to protect our systems and data, and to prevent, detect and respond to data security incidents, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats.
While we maintain cyber liability insurance that provides both third-party liability and first-party liability insurance coverage, such insurance may not be sufficient to protect against all of our businesses’ losses from any future disruptions or breaches of their systems or other events as described above.
Also, a cybersecurity breach and the changing cybersecurity landscape could require us to devote significant management resources to address the problems associated with the breach and to expend significant additional resources to upgrade further the security measures we employ to protect customer, employee, or other personal information against cyber-attacks and other wrongful attempts to access such information, which could result in a disruption of our operations.
For example, Virgin Enterprises Limited can terminate the licenses, after providing Virgin Media with an opportunity to cure, (1) if Virgin Media or any of its affiliates commits persistent and material breaches or a flagrant and material breach of the licenses,
I-32
(2) if Virgin Enterprises Limited has reasonable grounds to believe that the use (or lack of use) of the licensed trademarks by Virgin Media has been or is likely to result in a long-term and material diminution in the value of the “Virgin” brand, or (3) if a third-party who is not (or one of whose directors is not) a “fit and proper person”, such as a legally disqualified director or a bankrupt entity, acquires “control” of Liberty Global.
