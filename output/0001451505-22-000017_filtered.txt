For instance, working remotely may increase the risk of security breaches or other cyber incidents or attacks, loss of data, fraud and other disruptions as a consequence of more employees accessing sensitive and critical information from remote locations.
We are subject to cybersecurity risks and threats as well as increasing regulation of data privacy and security.
Threats to our information technology systems, and the systems of our customers and vendors, associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber-incidents or attacks continue to grow.
Such threats may derive from human error, fraud or malice, social engineering on the part of employees or third parties, or may result from accidental technological failure.
In addition, breaches to our systems and systems of our customers and vendors could go unnoticed for some period of time.
Risks associated with these threats include disruptions of certain systems on our rigs; other impairments of our ability to conduct our operations; loss or ransom of intellectual property, proprietary information, personal identifiable information or customer and vendor data; disruption of our customers’ and vendors’ operations; misappropriation of assets; loss or damage to our customer and vendor data delivery systems; and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.
