There is no guarantee of product performance or that our products are adequate to protect against all security breaches.
Security breaches and other disruptions could interfere with the Company’s operations and could compromise the Company’s and its customer’s information, exposing the Company to liability that would cause the Company’s business and reputation to suffer.
In addition, as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication, the Company may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of its systems.
