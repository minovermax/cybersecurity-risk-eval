Our business may be disrupted by natural disasters, infrastructure interruptions, COVID-19 or other public health threats.
Business disruptions caused by natural disasters, infrastructure interruptions, COVID-19 or other public health threats could seriously harm our future revenues and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.
The extent of the ultimate impact to us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure resulting from concentration in certain geographical areas is unknown and cannot be estimated, but our operations and financial condition would likely suffer in the event of a major earthquake, fire or other natural disaster or public health threat such as the coronavirus pandemic in one or more of those areas.
