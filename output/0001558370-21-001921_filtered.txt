Risks Related to the Use of Technology
The Company is dependent on computer and communications systems, and a systems failure, cyber-attack or data breach could cause a significant disruption to its business and cause financial losses.
The Company’s business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware systems and infrastructure, including operating and financial reporting systems, and on the effectiveness of the information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and capabilities the Company maintains to protect its systems and data.
Although the Company believes that it has robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place, as cyber threats continue to evolve, it may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance its information security measures and investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.
Even with such measures, the Company’s information technology and infrastructure are subject to attacks or misappropriation by hackers and may be, and have in the past been, breached due to inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the protective measures undertaken, employee errors or omissions, malfeasance or other disruptions.
Upon discovering that an unauthorized third party attempted to gain access to select servers, the Company took immediate action to stop the attack and remediate the systems.
The Company also promptly launched an internal investigation with the assistance of third-party cybersecurity partners to determine the scope of the incident and any potential impacts.
In addition, the Company’s third-party vendors and other intermediaries with which it conducts business and transmit data could be subject to a successful cyber-attack or other information security event, and the Company cannot ensure that such third parties have all appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of information in the custody of those third parties.
Further, the continued threats of tariffs, trade restrictions, and trade barriers could have a generally disruptive impact on the economy generally and decrease demand for the Company’s services.
