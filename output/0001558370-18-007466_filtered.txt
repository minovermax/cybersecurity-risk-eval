Interruptions also occur due to systems burdens brought on by unsolicited bulk email or “Spam,” malicious service attacks, denial of service attacks and hacking into operating systems, viruses, worms and a “Trojan” horse, the proliferation of which is beyond our control and may seriously impact our and our customers’ businesses.
If our cybersecurity systems or the systems of our vendors, partners and suppliers are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer’s data or our data or our IT systems, our service may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our service and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.
Our service involves the storage and transmission of customers’ proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, loss of access, litigation and possible liability.
These security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers (which may involve nation states and individuals sponsored by them), employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our customers’ data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, or our IT systems.
These cybersecurity attacks threaten to misappropriate our proprietary information, cause interruptions of our IT services and commit fraud.
Cybersecurity attacks could require significant expenditures of our capital and diversion of our resources.
