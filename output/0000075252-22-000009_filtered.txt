For example, voice or data line failures resulting from natural, manmade or cyber-attack could impair our ability to operate.
An extended period of remote work arrangements, and any worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic, or future outbreaks, could strain our business continuity plans, introduce operational risk, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks, and impair our ability to manage our business.
Our operations depend on the proper functioning of information systems, and our business or results of operations could be adversely affected if we experience a cyberattack or other systems breach or failure.
In addition, the success of our long-term growth strategy is dependent upon the ability to continually monitor and upgrade our information systems to provide better service to customers
Despite physical, technical, and administrative security measures, our technology systems and operations may be subject to cyberattacks from sources beyond our control.
In recent months, cyberattacks in our industry have increased and become more sophisticated and, as a result, the risk of a cyberattack on our systems has increased.
Cyberattacks include actual or attempted unauthorized access, tampering, malware insertion, ransomware attacks, or other system integrity events.
A cybersecurity incident could involve a material data breach or other material impact to the operations of our technology systems, which could result in failure of our systems to operate properly for an extended period of time, litigation or regulatory action, loss of customers or revenue, and increased expense, any of which might have a material adverse impact on our business operations, reputation, our growth and strategic initiatives, and our financial position or results of operation.
