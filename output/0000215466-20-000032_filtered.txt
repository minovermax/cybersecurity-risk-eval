The Company is dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to cybersecurity incidents, disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration.
The Companyâ€™s information technology systems used in its operations are subject to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, computer viruses, security breaches, cyberattacks, natural disasters and defects in design.
Cybersecurity incidents, in particular, are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data or machines and equipment, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, the corruption of data or the disabling, misuse or malfunction of machines and equipment.
However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information or operational technology disruptions, the Company could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, operating accidents, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.
