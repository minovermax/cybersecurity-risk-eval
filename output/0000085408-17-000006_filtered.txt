Our information technology systems are subject to cybersecurity risks and threats.
Cybersecurity risks and threats to such systems continue to grow and may be difficult to anticipate, prevent, identify or mitigate.
A breach or failure could also result in injury (financial or otherwise) to people, loss of control of, or damage to, our (or our customersâ€™) assets, harm to the environment, reputational damage, breaches of laws or regulations, litigation and other legal liabilities.
In addition, we may incur significant costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity risks or events and to defend against any investigations, litigation or other proceedings that may follow such events.
