The investment and growth in our omnichannel capabilities also increases our vulnerability to other material risks and uncertainties, including changes in required technology interfaces, technical failures, costs and technical issues related to upgrading website software, changes in applicable federal and state regulations, data security and ransomware breaches, consumer privacy concerns and maintaining competitive technology, some of which we do not control.
We invest considerable resources in maintaining our computer systems and protecting sensitive information, but our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may nevertheless be vulnerable to security breaches, cybercrimes, computer viruses, programming or human errors or other similar events, some of which may not be immediately detected.
The legal and regulatory environment regarding cybersecurity and data privacy is increasingly complex and expansive, including enhanced requirements for using and treating personal data.
In addition, any changes in the legal or regulatory environment affecting labor and employment, trade, product safety, cybersecurity and data privacy, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, responsible sourcing, operations or environmental issues, among others, may increase the complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance.
