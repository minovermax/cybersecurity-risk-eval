Information technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business.
These information technology systems are dependent upon global communications providers, web browsers, telephone systems and other aspects of the Internet infrastructure that have experienced security breaches, cyber-attacks, significant systems failures and electrical outages in the past.
We may also be required to incur significant costs to protect against damages caused by these information technology failures or security breaches in the future.
However, we cannot provide assurance that a security breach, cyber-attack, data theft or other significant systems failures will not occur in the future, and such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.
