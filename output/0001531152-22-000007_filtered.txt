Nevertheless, the COVID-19 pandemic, or any future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of any other highly infection disease, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and may have the effect of heightening many of the risks described in this "Risk Factors" section, including:
•a complete or partial closure of, or a decrease in member traffic at, one or more of our clubs, due to government restrictions and limitations intended to promote social distancing and contain the spread of COVID-19, which could adversely affect our net sales and operating results;
•any difficulties and delays in obtaining products from our distributors and suppliers, delivering products to our clubs and adequately staffing our clubs and distribution centers, which have resulted in, and could continue to result in, an inability to maintain inventory levels and meet our members’ demands and have caused, and may continue to cause, us to seek alternative and potentially more expensive sources of supply;
•a decrease in consumer discretionary spending and confidence or changes in our members’ needs, each of which could adversely affect member demand for the products we sell, result in shifts in demand to lower priced options and change the mix of products we sell, result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, cause us to lose existing members and/or fail to attract new members, or otherwise materially adversely affect our net sales and operating results;
•any inability to continue to provide our team members with appropriate compensation and protective measures, which could cause us to be unable to retain current or attract new team members to perform necessary functions within our clubs and distribution centers;
•any spread of COVID-19 among our team members or employees of our distributors or suppliers, within a particular club, distribution center or geographical area, may necessitate that impacted clubs, distribution centers or suppliers operate with reduced staffing or be temporarily closed, which could negatively impact our business and financial condition, as well as our reputation; and
•limited access to our management, support staff and professional advisors, which could decrease the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, increase our susceptibility to security breaches, or hamper our ability to comply with regulatory obligations, leading to reputational harm and regulatory issues or fines.
In addition, the cost of securing our systems against failure or attack is considerable, and increases in these costs, particularly in the wake of a breach or failure, could be material.
Risks associated with our e-commerce business include, but are not limited to: uncertainties associated with our website, including changes in required technology interfaces, website downtime and other technical failures, costs and technical issues as we upgrade our website software, inadequate system capacity, computer viruses, human error, security breaches; disruptions in telecommunications service or power outages; reliance on third parties for computer hardware and software and delivery of merchandise to our customers; rapid changes in technology; credit or debit card fraud and other payment processing related issues; changes in applicable federal and state regulations; liability for online content; cybersecurity and consumer privacy concerns and regulation.
