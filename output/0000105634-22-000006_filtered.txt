We are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology systems; our business and results of operations are subject to adverse impacts due to disruption, failure, and cybersecurity breaches of these systems.
However, our information technology systems and those of our customers and third-party providers are subject to cyber-attacks, hacking, other intrusions, failure, and damage, which result in operational disruption and could result in information misappropriation, such as theft of intellectual property or inappropriate disclosure of customer data or confidential or personal information.
This attack temporarily disrupted our use of the impacted systems.
However, we may not anticipate or combat all types of potential disruptions or breaches.
Additionally, as many of our employees use our information technology systems to collaborate with colleagues in different geographic locations and periodically access our systems remotely, we may be subject to heightened security risks, including the risks of cyber-attacks.
The proper functioning of our information technology systems could also be impacted by other causes and circumstances beyond our control, including malware embedded in third party applications, the decision by software vendors to discontinue further development, integration, or long-term software maintenance support for our information systems, or hardware interruption, damage or disruption as a result of power outages, natural disasters, or computer network failures.
Additionally, as many of our employees periodically access our systems remotely, in part as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential business or facility closures or reduced or staggered in-person attendance, we may be subject to heightened security risks, including the risks of cyber-attacks.
