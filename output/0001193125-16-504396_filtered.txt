We cannot predict, however, whether the holders of the PEAKS Senior Debt will assert other breaches of the PEAKS Guarantee by us or assert that any breach of the PEAKS Guarantee or event of default under the PEAKS Indenture was not properly cured.
Possession and use of personal information in our operations also subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could require notification of data breaches and restrict our use of personal information.
Security breaches or system interruptions or delays involving our computer networks could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, limit our ability to attract and retain students and require us to expend significant resources.
Our computer systems may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses and other security problems.
As a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of those security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by those breaches.
