Cyber-attacks, including those targeting information systems or electronic control systems used to operate our utility projects and the facilities of third parties on which our utility projects rely could severely disrupt business operations, result in loss of service to customers and significant expense to repair security breaches or system damage.
The NERC reliability standards are a series of requirements that relate to maintaining the reliability of the North American bulk electric system and cover a wide variety of topics including physical and cybersecurity of critical assets, information protocols, frequency and voltage standards, testing, documentation and outage management.
Information technology system failures, or network disruptions and security breaches, including cybersecurity breaches, could damage our business operations, financial conditions, or reputation.
These may be caused by natural disasters, accidents, power disruptions, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism or war, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, or similar events or disruptions.
Any such cyberattack or breach could: (i) compromise our projects thereby adversely affecting generation and transmission to the grid; (ii) adversely affect our business operations; (iii) corrupt data; or (iv) result in unauthorized access to the information stored on our networks, including, company proprietary information and employee data causing the information to be publicly disclosed, lost or stolen or result in incidents that could result in harmful effects on the environment and human health, including loss of life.
Any such attack, breach, access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in lost revenue, the inability to conduct critical business functions, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory penalties, increased regulation, increased protection costs for enhanced cyber security systems or personnel, damage to our reputation and the rendering of our disclosure controls and procedures ineffective, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make cash distributions to our Class A shareholders.
