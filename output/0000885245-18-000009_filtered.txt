The Company’s information systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:
•
Earthquake, fire, flood, tornado, and other natural disasters;
•
Power loss, computer systems failure, internet and telecommunications or data network failure;
•
Hackers, computer viruses, software bugs, or glitches.
Despite safeguards and security processes and protections, the Company’s computer systems may be susceptible to electronic or physical computer break-ins, viruses, and other disruptions and security breaches.
Additionally, the Company may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks.
In addition, data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breach by employees or by persons with whom the Company has commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information.
