We may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security.
The size and complexity of our computer systems make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown, malicious intrusion and random attack.
Our security measures could be breached by third-party action, computer viruses, accidents or error or misconduct by an employee or contractor.
While we have invested in protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business.
