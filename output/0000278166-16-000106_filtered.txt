Information technology failures or data security breaches could harm our business
We use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational activities and to maintain our business records.
Our computer systems, including our back-up systems, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches (through cyber-attacks from computer hackers and sophisticated organizations), catastrophic events such as fires, tornadoes and hurricanes and human error.
Given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of information technology disruptions, if our computer systems and our backup systems are damaged, breached, or cease to function properly, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information (including information about our home buyers and business partners), destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.
