In addition to general information and cyber risks that all large corporations face, we face evolving cybersecurity risks associated with protecting sensitive and confidential customer and employee information and energy grid, natural gas pipeline, storage and other infrastructure.
Our use of business technologies, including deployment of any new technologies, represents a large-scale opportunity for attacks on or other failures to protect our information systems, confidential information and energy grid and natural gas infrastructure.
In particular, cyber- and other attacks targeting utility systems and other energy infrastructures, as well as the impacts of these attacks on companies and their communities, are increasing in sophistication, magnitude and frequency and may further increase in the event of geopolitical events and other uncertainties, such as the conflict in Ukraine.
Further, the virtualization of many business activities during the COVID-19 pandemic increases cyber risk, and generally there has been an associated increase in targeted cyber-attacks.
Moreover, all our businesses operating in California are subject to enhanced state privacy laws, which require companies that collect information about California residents to, among other things, make disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices; allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties; and be liable under a new cause of action for breaches of certain highly sensitive personal information, and other states in which we do business could adopt similar laws.
If we are unable to defend and retain title to the properties we own or if we are unable to obtain or retain rights to construct and operate on the properties we do not own on reasonable financial and other terms, we could lose our rights to occupy and use these properties and the related facilities, which could delay or derail proposed projects, increase our development costs, and result in breaches of one or more permits or contracts related to the affected facilities that could lead to legal costs, fines or penalties.
