Cyber-attacks affecting the Company, its supply chain or customers could compromise confidential, business critical information, cause a disruption in the Companyâ€™s operations, harm the Company's reputation, or endanger the environment if the Company, its suppliers or customers do not effectively prevent, detect and recover from these or other security breaches.
FutureFuel, like many companies today, is the target of industrial espionage, including cyber-attacks.
Although management does not believe that the Company has experienced any material losses to date related to these cyber security breaches, there can be no assurance that such losses will not be suffered in the future.
The Company seeks to actively manage the risks within its control that could lead to business disruptions and cyber security breaches through a comprehensive cyber security program that is continuously reviewed (through internal and external, third party, auditing), maintained, and upgraded.
As these threats continue to evolve, particularly around cybersecurity, the Company may be required to expend significant resources to enhance its control environment, processes, practices, and other protective measures.
