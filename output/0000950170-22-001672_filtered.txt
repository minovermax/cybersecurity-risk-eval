AVISTA CORPORATION
Cyber and Technology Risk Factors
Cyberattacks, ransomware, terrorism or other malicious acts could disrupt our businesses and have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.
Cyberattacks, ransomware, terrorism or other malicious acts could damage, destroy or disrupt these systems for an extended period of time.
The energy sector, particularly electric and natural gas utility companies have become the subject of cyberattacks with increased frequency.
Our administrative and operating networks are targeted by hackers on a regular basis.
Therefore, an event caused by cyberattacks, ransomware or other malicious act at an interconnected third party could impact our business and facilities similarly.
These cyberattacks have become more common and sophisticated and, as such, we could be required to incur costs to strengthen our systems and respond to emerging concerns.
