Risks Related to Technology
Our business could be seriously impacted by business disruptions and security breaches, including cybersecurity incidents.
Cyber-attacks or security breaches could compromise confidential, business critical information, cause a disruption in the Company’s operations or harm the Company’s reputation.
While the Company has a comprehensive cyber-security program that is continuously reviewed, maintained and upgraded, there can be no assurance that such procedures, controls, and intelligence will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring.
If any security breaches were to occur, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and could result in claims being brought against us.
