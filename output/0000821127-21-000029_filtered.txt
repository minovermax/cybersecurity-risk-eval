We are subject to heightened cybersecurity, information security and operational risks as a result of work-from-home arrangements that we have put in place for our employees.
These issues include, but are not limited to: legal and regulatory requirements; privacy; cybersecurity; properly maintaining client and employee personal information; record keeping; anti money-laundering compliance; sales and trading practices; ethical issues; appropriately addressing potential conflicts of interest; and the proper identification and disclosure of the legal, reputational, credit, liquidity, and market risks inherent in our products and services.
This risk has increased significantly due to the use of online, telephonic and mobile channels by clients and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other external parties.
As a result, cybersecurity and the continued enhancement of our controls and processes to protect our systems, data and networks from attacks, unauthorized access or significant damage remain a priority.
