Although we maintain liability insurance for our directors and officers, auto liability, and loss due to cybersecurity incidents among various other policies, the coverage limits of these policies may not be adequate to cover all future claims.
Our actual or perceived failure to protect such information and data, mitigate data loss, and prevent a cybersecurity or other incident could damage our reputation and harm our business and operating results.
We expend significant resources to protect against both internal and external security breaches and may need to expend more resources in the event we need to address problems caused by breaches.
We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws regarding privacy, cybersecurity and the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information and other data.
Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy- or cybersecurity-related obligations to consumers, employees, or other third parties, or our privacy- or cybersecurity-related legal obligations, or any compromise generally of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of sensitive information, which may include personally identifiable information or other customer or employee data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause consumers, employees, vendors, securitization investors, and receivable financing partners to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business.
Interruptions in these systems, whether due to system failures, programming or configuration errors, computer viruses, or physical or electronic break-ins, could limit the availability of our inventory on our website and prevent or inhibit consumers from accessing our website.
For example, our web-hosting providers could close their facilities without adequate notice or suffer interruptions in service caused by cyber-attacks, natural disasters or other phenomena.
