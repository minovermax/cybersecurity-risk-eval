Such interruptions could occur by virtue of natural disaster, malicious actions such as hacking or acts of terrorism or war, or human error.
Data loss or other breaches of our network security could materially harm our business and results of operations, and the processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities and additional costs as a result of governmental regulation, litigation and conflicting legal requirements relating to personal privacy rights.
In addition, security breaches or the inability to protect our data could lead to increased incidents of ticketing fraud and counterfeit tickets.
Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, such measures cannot provide absolute security or certainty.
It is possible that advances in computer and hacker capabilities, new variants of malware, the development of new penetration methods and tools, inadvertent violations of company policies or procedures or other developments could result in a compromise of information or a breach of the technology and security processes that are used to protect customer information.
We have expended significant capital and other resources to protect against and remedy such potential security breaches and their consequences, including the establishment of a dedicated cybersecurity organization within our larger technology environment, and will continue to do so in the future.
We also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties with which we are affiliated or with which we otherwise conduct business.
