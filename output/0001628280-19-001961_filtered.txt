We rely on computer systems to run our business and security breaches could disrupt or damage our internal operations, information technology systems or reputation and expose us to litigation risk.
Such uses give rise to cyber security risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, hacking, cyber-attack, theft and inadvertent release of information.
As a result, we could experience significant disruptions of our operations and incur significant expenses addressing problems created by these breaches.
