Our business could be negatively affected by security threats, including cybersecurity threats and other disruptions.
Cyber-attacks could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations or the loss of our data and proprietary information.
A cyber-attack against these operating systems, or the networks and infrastructure on which they rely, could damage critical production, distribution and/or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets, cause accidental discharge and/or make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transactions.
A cyber-attack on a vendor or a service provider could result in supply chain disruptions, which could delay or halt development projects.
A cyber-attack on our accounting system could expose us to liability if personal information is obtained.
In particular, our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our personnel, information, facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs.
Moreover, there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring.
If any of these security breaches were to occur, they could lead to harm to our employees or losses of sensitive information, losses of critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, and results of operations or cash flows.
Future activist efforts could result in the following:
•
delay or denial of drilling permits;
•
shortening of lease terms and reduction in lease size;
•
restrictions on installation or operation of production, gathering or processing facilities;
•
restrictions on the use of certain operating practices, such as hydraulic fracturing, or the disposal of related waste materials, such as hydraulic fracturing fluids and produced water;
•
increased severance and/or other taxes;
•
cyber-attacks;
•
legal challenges or lawsuits;
•
negative publicity about our business or the oil and gas industry in general;
•
increased costs of doing business;
•
reduction in demand for our products; and
•
other adverse effects on our ability to develop our properties and expand production.
