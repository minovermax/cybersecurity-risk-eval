Information system failures, cyber incidents or breaches in security could adversely affect us.
Our information systems, and those of our vendors and service providers, are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunication failures, computer viruses, security breaches, including malware and phishing, cyberattacks, natural disasters, usage errors by employees and other related risks.
Any cyber incident or attack or breach or other disruption or failure in these information systems, or other systems or infrastructure upon which they rely, could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.
We have been the target of a number of unsuccessful cyber-attacks and we expect these attacks to continue into the foreseeable future.
Although we have implemented systems and processes intended to secure our information systems, there can be no assurance that our efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our
information systems will be effective or that future attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.
