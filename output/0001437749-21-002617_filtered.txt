We may also be required to incur significant costs to protect against damages caused by information technology failures or security breaches in the future.
We provide employee awareness training of cybersecurity threats, procure cyber insurance, and routinely utilize information technology consultants to assist us in our evaluations of the effectiveness of the security of our information technology systems.
However, because methods used to obtain unauthorized access or disable systems evolve frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these attacks or to implement adequate preventative measures and we cannot eliminate the risk of such security breaches, cyber attacks, or other significant system or security failures, and such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.
In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data or system protection measure could be significant and our efforts to deter, identify, mitigate and/or eliminate any security breaches or incidents may not be successful.
