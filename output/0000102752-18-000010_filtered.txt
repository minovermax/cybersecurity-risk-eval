We face the threat to our computer systems of unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, malicious code, organized cyber-attacks and other security problems and system disruptions, including possible unauthorized access to our and our clients' proprietary or classified information.
Foreign nations with interests that conflict with the international clients we support could be motivated to conduct a cyber-attack to access information on these programs.
Costs associated with preventing or remediating information management security breaches have not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
