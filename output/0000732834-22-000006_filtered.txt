Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business associates have been and continue to be the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches, which could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release or theft of confidential or protected information, corruption of data or other disruptions of our business operations.
In response to those incidents, we deployed our cybersecurity incidence response protocols and promptly took steps to contain and remediate potential vulnerabilities.
We believe there have been no compromises to our operations as a result of the attacks; however, other similar attacks in the future could have a significant negative impact on our systems and operations.
A cyber attack involving our information systems and related infrastructure, and/or that of our business associates and customers, could disrupt our business and negatively impact our operations in a variety of ways, including but not limited to unauthorized access to, or theft of, sensitive or proprietary information and data corruption or operational disruption that adversely affects our ability to carry on our business.
While the Company has well-established cyber security systems and controls, disclosure controls and procedures and incident response protocols, these systems, controls, procedures and protocols may not identify all risks and threats we face, or may fail to protect data or mitigate the adverse effects of data loss.
To our knowledge we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks; however, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer material losses in the future either as a result of a breach of our systems or those of our business associates.
As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.
