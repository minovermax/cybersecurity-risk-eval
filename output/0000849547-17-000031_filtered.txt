In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, power outages, systems failures, security breaches and viruses.
Disruption or breaches of security to our information technology systems and the misappropriation of our clients’ data could adversely impact our business.
We have privacy and data security policies in place that are designed to prevent security breaches and confidentiality and data security provisions are standard in our client contracts.
However, as newer technologies evolve, our security practices and products may be sabotaged or circumvented by third parties, such as hackers, which could result in disruptions to our clients’ businesses, unauthorized procurement and the disclosure of sensitive corporate information or private personal information.
Such breaches in security could damage our reputation and our business; they could also expose us to legal claims, proceedings and liability and to regulatory penalties under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.
