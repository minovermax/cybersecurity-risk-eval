Security breaches, including with respect to cybersecurity, and other disruptions could compromise our information, products, and services and expose us to liability and harm our reputation and business.
As a participant in the molecular diagnostic market, we may face cyber-attacks that attempt to penetrate our network security, including our data centers, sabotage or otherwise disable our research, products and services, including instruments at our customers’ sites, which may include personally identifiable information, or cause interruptions of our internal systems.
If successful, hackers may misappropriate personal or confidential business information.
While we continue to implement additional protective measures to reduce the risk of and detect cyber incidents, cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and the techniques used in such attacks change rapidly.
Despite our cybersecurity measures (including employee and third-party training, monitoring of networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems) which are continuously reviewed and upgraded, the Company’s information technology networks and infrastructure may still be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attack by hackers or breaches, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, systems failures, natural disasters or other catastrophic events.
If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, implement and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, the inability to properly support and service our customers, processing inefficiencies, loss of customers, business disruptions or loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach or cyber-attack, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business.
