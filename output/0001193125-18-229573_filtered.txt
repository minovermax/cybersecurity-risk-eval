If a security breach or cyberattack of our IT networks and systems occurs, our operations could be interrupted.
Although we have controls and security measures in place to prevent such attacks, experienced computer hackers are increasingly organized and sophisticated.
Malicious attack efforts operate on a large-scale and sometimes offer targeted attacks as a paid-for service.
While we have implemented network security and internal control measures, especially for the purpose of protecting our connected products and services from cyberattacks, and invested in our data and information technology infrastructure, there can be no assurance that these efforts will prevent a system disruption, attack, or security breach and, as such, the risk of system disruptions and security breaches from a cyberattack remains.
