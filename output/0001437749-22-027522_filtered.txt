A cyberattack may disrupt Spire’s operations or lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information or potential liability.
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to cybersecurity risks primarily related to breaches of security pertaining to sensitive customer, employee, and vendor information maintained by the Company, its subsidiaries, or its third-party vendors in the normal course of business, as well as breaches in the technology that manages natural gas distribution operations and other business processes.
A loss of confidential or proprietary data or security breaches of technology for operations or business processes could adversely affect the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ reputation, diminish customer confidence, disrupt operations, and subject the Company and its subsidiaries to possible financial liability, any of which could have a material effect on the Company’s and its subsidiaries’ financial condition and results of operations.
The Company acknowledges that increased dependence on technology increases the Company’s exposure to cyberattack.
