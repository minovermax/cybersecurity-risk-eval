§
Our information technology systems are subject to cybersecurity risks and threats.
Threats to our information technology systems, and the systems of our customers and vendors, associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber-incidents or attacks continue to grow.
Threats to our systems and our customers’ and vendors’ systems may derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties, or may result from accidental technological failure.
In addition, breaches to our systems and systems of our customers and vendors could go unnoticed for some period of time.
Risks associated with these threats include disruptions of certain systems on our rigs; other impairments of our ability to conduct our operations; loss of intellectual property, proprietary information or customer and vendor data; disruption of our customers’ and vendors’ operations; loss or damage to our customer and vendor data delivery systems; and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.
Travel restrictions or operational problems in any part of the world in which we operate, or any reduction in the demand for drilling services caused by public health threats in the future, may materially impact our operations and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.
