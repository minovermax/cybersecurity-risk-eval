Our financial, accounting, data processing or other information systems and facilities, or those of third parties on whom we rely, may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as a spike in transaction volume, cyber attack or other unforeseen catastrophic events, which may adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services.
﻿
Although we make continuous efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information systems and have not experienced a significant, successful cyber attack, threats to information systems continue to evolve and there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures, or those of third parties on whom we rely, will continue to be effective.
Threats to our information systems may originate externally from third parties such as foreign governments, organized crime and other hackers, outsourced or infrastructure support providers and application developers, or may originate internally.
As a financial institution, we face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption from attempts to gain unauthorized access to our and our customers’ data and financial information, whether through cyber attack, cyber intrusion over the internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, spoofing, phishing, or spyware.
As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.
﻿
As a result, our information, communications and related systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to breaches or other significant disruptions that could: (1) disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems, which could in turn disrupt our operations and those of certain of our customers; (2) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including account numbers and other financial information; (3) result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny and exposing us to civil litigation and possible financial liability; (4) require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; and (5) harm our reputation or impair our customer relationships.
The occurrence of such failures, disruptions or security breaches could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.
However, “denial of service” attacks continue to be launched against a number of other large financial services institutions.
However, we cannot assure that this policy will afford coverage for all possible losses or would be sufficient to cover all financial losses, damages, penalties, including lost revenues, should we experience any one or more of our or a third party’s systems failing or experiencing attack.
﻿
Negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged improper activities, such as lending practices, data security breaches, corporate governance policies and decisions, and acquisitions, any of which may damage our reputation.
