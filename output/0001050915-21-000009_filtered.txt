In addition to these current dynamics, the COVID-19 pandemic may create or exacerbate risks related to our operations and regulatory and compliance matters, including as a result of:
•evolving governmental guidance or requirements, including travel and movement restrictions, that continue to impact our ability to perform services or complete projects in accordance with required delivery schedules, which could result in additional costs or penalties (e.g., liquidated damages);
•additional delays with respect to permitting and regulatory matters and additional project deferrals, delays, and cancellations and changes in customer spending patterns and strategic plans as a result of, among other things, prolonged decreases in energy demand, lack of available financing for our customers’ businesses or termination of, or force majeure events arising under, existing customer agreements;
•governmental guidance or requirements, including work-from-home policies, or potential illness that negatively impact the availability or productivity of our key personnel or a significant number of employees or cause other disruptions to our business, corporate governance or financial reporting processes;
•increased payment risk associated with customers experiencing financial difficulties (including bankruptcy) and an increase in disputes with customers relating to billing and payment under contracts and change orders;
•potential liabilities and reputational harm related to occupational health and safety matters;
•our inability to execute our business strategy, including with respect to certain capital investments such as acquisitions, investments and service offering expansions;
•limitations on the ability of our suppliers, vendors and subcontractors to perform;
•additional impairment charges related to goodwill, other intangible assets, other long-lived assets and investments;
•additional costs associated with restructuring, severance and related matters or other increased employment-related costs (e.g., workers’ compensation insurance claims); and
•an increase in cyber-attacks and attempted intrusions into our information technology systems as a result of, among other things, increased reliance on such systems.
Cyber-attacks can result in compromises of our payment systems, monetary losses, inability to access our systems, delays in processing transactions or reporting financial results, the disclosure or misappropriation of confidential or proprietary company information (including for the purpose of transacting in our stock), or the release of customer, stockholder, vendor or employee data.
An attack could also cause service disruptions to our internal systems or, in extreme circumstances, infiltration into, damage to or loss of control of our customers’ energy infrastructure systems.
