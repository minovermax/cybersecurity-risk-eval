We Are Subject to Cybersecurity Risks - We rely on information technology in all aspects of our business, including technology systems operated by us or under control of third parties.
While there can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect such incidents or attacks, or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems after such incidents or attacks do occur, we are continually evaluating attackersâ€™ techniques and tactics, and we are diligent in our monitoring, training, planning, and prevention.
A successful cyber-attack may result in significant service interruption; safety failure; other operational difficulties; unauthorized access to (or the loss of access to) competitively sensitive, confidential, or other critical data or systems; loss of customers; financial losses; regulatory fines; and misuse or corruption of critical data and proprietary information, which could all have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
We also may experience security breaches that could remain undetected for an extended period and, therefore, have a greater impact on the services we offer.
