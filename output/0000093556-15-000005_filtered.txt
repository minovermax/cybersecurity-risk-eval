Business operations outside of the United States are subject to political, economic and other risks inherent in operating in certain countries, such as:
•
the difficulty of enforcing agreements and protecting assets through legal systems outside the U.S.;
•
managing widespread operations and enforcing internal policies and procedures such as compliance with U.S. and foreign anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations;
•
trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;
•
the application of certain labor regulations outside of the United States;
•
compliance with a wide variety of non-U.S. laws and regulations;
•
changes in the general political and economic conditions in the countries where the Company operates, particularly in emerging markets;
•
the threat of nationalization and expropriation;
•
increased costs and risks of doing business in a wide variety of jurisdictions;
•
government controls limiting importation of goods;
•
government controls limiting payments to suppliers for imported goods;
•
limitations on repatriation of earnings; and
•
exposure to wage, price and capital controls.
The performance of the Company may suffer from business disruptions associated with information technology, cyber attacks, system implementations, or catastrophic losses affecting distribution centers and other infrastructure.
Despite efforts to prevent such situations, insurance policies and loss control and risk management practices that partially mitigate these risks, the Company’s systems may be affected by damage or interruption from, among other causes, power outages, system failures or computer viruses.
Further, security threats and sophisticated computer crime pose a potential risk to the security of the Company’s information technology systems, networks and services, as well as the confidentiality and integrity of the Company’s data.
If the Company suffers a loss or disclosure of business or stakeholder information due to security breaches, and business continuity plans do not effectively address these issues on a timely basis, the Company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage operations as well as reputational, competitive or business harm, which may adversely impact the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.
