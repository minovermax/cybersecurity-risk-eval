There can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect such attacks.
If such incidents or attacks do occur, they could have a material impact on our systems including degradation of service, service disruption, excessive call volume to call centers and damage to our facilities, equipment and data.
With the acquisition of Cyphre, we now market our cybersecurity services as an expertise.
A successful cyberattack against us may create negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with customers.
