In addition, employees working remotely may not have the resources available to enable them to maintain the same level of productivity and efficiency, and increased reliance on remote access to our information systems increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity threats.
We are vulnerable to certain risks and uncertainties associated with our e-commerce operations, including changes in required technology interfaces, website downtime and other technical failures, costs and technical issues for upgrades of our website software, computer viruses, changes in applicable federal and state regulations, security breaches and consumer privacy concerns.
Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to criminal cyber-attacks or security incidents due to employee error, malfeasance or other vulnerabilities.
Many states have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving their personal data.
We may experience operational problems with our information systems, as well as loss of funds, intellectual property or other proprietary information, as a result of system failures, viruses, computer “hackers” or other causes.
