Our operational risks include the risk of malfeasance by employees or persons outside our company, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, systems failures or interruptions, breaches of our internal control systems and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery.
Although to date we have not experienced any technology failures, cyber-attacks or other information or security breaches, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or other consequences in the future.
Our information technology systems may be subject to failure, interruption or security breaches.
We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions and security breaches, including privacy breaches and cyber-attacks, and, although we have not experienced any such events to date, such failures, interruptions or breaches may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur.
Such attacks include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or information or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information, damages to systems, or other material disruptions to network access or business operations.
Because the techniques used to cause security breaches change frequently, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.
To our knowledge, the services and programs provided to us by third parties have not suffered any security breaches.
However, the existence of cyber-attacks or security breaches at third parties with access to our data, such as vendors, may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner.
