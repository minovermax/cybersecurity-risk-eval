Information technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business.
In addition, breaches of our data security systems, including by cyber-attacks, could result in the unintended public disclosure or the misappropriation of our proprietary information or personal and confidential information, about our employees, consumers who view our homes, home buyers, mortgage loan applicants and business partners, requiring us to incur significant expense to address and resolve these kinds of issues.
Depending on its nature, a particular breach or series of breaches of our systems may result in the unauthorized use, appropriation or loss of confidential or proprietary information on a one-time or continuing basis, which may not be detected for a period of time.
In 2019, certain of our loan applicants experienced identity theft that we determined had occurred through the unauthorized access of one of our third-party service providerâ€™s information systems, and, in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we were the
direct target of an external cyber-attack that temporarily disrupted access to certain of our systems and may have resulted in the compromise of some proprietary internal data.
However, we expect that we will continue to be the target of additional and increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks and data security breaches, and the safeguards we have designed to help prevent these incidents from occurring may not be successful.
Recently, there has been a surge in widespread cyber-attacks during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Any increase in the frequency or scope of cyber-attacks during the pandemic may exacerbate these data security risks.
If we experience additional cyber-attacks or data security breaches in the future, we could suffer material liabilities, our reputation could be materially damaged and our operations could be materially disrupted.
