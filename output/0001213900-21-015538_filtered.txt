We could be harmed by network disruptions, security breaches, or other significant disruptions or failures of our IT infrastructure and related systems or of those we operate for certain of our customers
To be successful, we need to continue to have available, for our and our customers' used, a high capacity, reliable and secure network.
We are also subject to breaches of out network resulting in unauthorized utilization of our services or products, which subject us to the costs of providing those products or services, which are likely not recoverable.
Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and systems, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging, especially in light of the growing sophistication of cyber-attacks and intrusions sponsored by state or other interests.
Certain of our business units have been the subject of attempted and successful cyber-attacks in the past.
