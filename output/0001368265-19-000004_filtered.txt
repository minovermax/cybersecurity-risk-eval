Increased global IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, and services.
Increased global IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data.
There have been several recent, highly publicized cases in which organizations of various types and sizes have reported the unauthorized disclosure of customer or other confidential information, as well as cyberattacks involving the dissemination, theft and destruction of corporate information, intellectual property, cash or other valuable assets.
There have also been several highly publicized cases in which hackers have requested “ransom” payments in exchange for not disclosing customer or other confidential information or for not disabling the target company’s computer or other systems.
Implementing security measures designed to prevent, detect, mitigate or correct these or other IT security threats involves significant costs, and any such measures we have implemented or may implement in the future could be inadequate or could fail, especially because cyberattack techniques are increasingly sophisticated, change frequently and are often not recognized until launched.
Any IT security threats that are successful against our security measures could, depending on their nature and scope, lead to the compromise of confidential information, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, operational disruptions and substantial financial outlays.
Further, a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection, and an investigation of any successful cyberattack would likely require significant time, costs and other resources to complete.
