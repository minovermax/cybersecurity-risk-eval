Negative publicity can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance, acquisitions, cyber-attacks, breach in security, and actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities.
While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure, interruption or security breach of our information systems, there can be no assurance that any such failures, interruptions or security breaches will not occur; or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed.
The occurrence of any failures, interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability; any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
We face the risk of cyber-attack to our computer systems.
