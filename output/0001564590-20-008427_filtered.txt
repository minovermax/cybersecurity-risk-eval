We may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions, cybersecurity attacks and breaches in data security, which may materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and business.
In particular, a cybersecurity breach, as a result of attack, human error or otherwise, could result in the loss or unauthorized disclosure of our intellectual property, proprietary information and personal information of our customers and employees.
We cannot provide absolute assurance that our controls and procedures are sufficient to ensure that relevant information pertaining to cybersecurity risks and incidents is identified, collected, processed and timely reported to the appropriate parties to allow management to properly assess and analyze potential impacts and disclosure obligations.
Further, despite our best efforts, employees may not be fully aware or understand our cybersecurity internal controls and may fail to recognize potentially relevant events.
An information technology failure, including as a result of human error or the failure of internal controls with respect to cybersecurity, could expose us to financial losses from necessary remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, as well as reputational damage, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and business.
