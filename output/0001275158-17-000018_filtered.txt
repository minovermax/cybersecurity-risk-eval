Our operations depend upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and systems against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external security breaches, viruses and other disruptive problems.
Given the nature of the industry in which we operate, we are susceptible to data security breaches, such as the data security incident that we experienced in 2016.
