Cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, or damage to our reputation.
Our computer systems experience cyber-attacks and data security incidents of varying degrees on a regular basis.
In addition, while effort has been expanded to have insurance to cover these losses, we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against or alleviate any problems caused by actual or threatened cyber-attacks or other unauthorized access to such data.
Our security measures may not be sufficient to prevent security breaches, and any failure to prevent the improper use and disclosure of data and/or to adequately alleviate any problems caused by such improper use and disclosure could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
If our customers, vendors and other partners fail to prevent any significant cyber security breaches, their businesses could be disrupted which may negatively impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We believe that compliance with such legislation will impair our ability to provide our customers with robust and secure technology solutions and will increase our risk of data security and privacy breaches, system and data integrity problems, and associated adverse competitive, financial, operational, and reputational impacts.
Any data breaches and the related notifications and remedies may result in significant compliance costs in addition to potential liability and reputational damage.
