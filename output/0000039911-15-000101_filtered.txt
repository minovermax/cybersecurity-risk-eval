However, despite our safeguards and security processes and protections, security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability.
The retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks.
We may not have the resources to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks.
In addition, even if we take appropriate measures to safeguard our information security and privacy environment from security breaches, we could still expose our customers and our business to risk.
Measures we implement to protect against cyber-attacks may also have the potential to impact our customersâ€™ shopping experience or decrease activity on our websites by making them more difficult to use.
Data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breach by our employees or
by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information.
In addition, the regulatory environment surrounding information security, cybersecurity, and privacy is increasingly demanding, with new and changing requirements, and customers have a high expectation that the Company will adequately protect their personal information from cyber-attack or other security breaches.
Security breaches and cyber incidents could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of consumer confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.
