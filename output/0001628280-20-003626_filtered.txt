Breaches or compromises of our information security systems or our information technology systems or infrastructure could result in exposure of private information, disruption of our business and damage to our reputation, which could harm our business, results of operation and financial condition.
Hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large-scale and complex automated attacks, including on companies within the healthcare industry.
Although we believe that we take appropriate measures to safeguard sensitive information within our possession, we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly-evolving types of cyber-attacks targeted at us, our patients, or others who have entrusted us with information.
In addition, data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical failures.
To our knowledge, we have not experienced any material breach of our cybersecurity systems.
Any cybersecurity incident, even unintended, could expose us to significant fines and remediation costs and materially impair our business operations and financial position.
Compliance with federal and state privacy and data security laws is expensive, and we may be subject to government or private actions due to privacy and security breaches.
Despite our efforts to prevent privacy and security breaches, it may still occur.
If any non-compliance with such laws and regulations results in privacy or security breaches, we could be subject to monetary fines, suits, penalties or sanctions.
