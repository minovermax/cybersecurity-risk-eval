Any interruptions or delays in our service, whether as a result of third-party error, our own error, natural disasters, security breaches or a result of any other issues, whether accidental or willful, could harm our relationships with clients and cause our revenue to decrease and our expenses to increase.
In particular, cyberattacks, such as phishing, continue to increase in frequency and in magnitude generally, and these threats are being driven by a variety of sources, including nation-state sponsored espionage and hacking activities, industrial espionage, organized crime, sophisticated organizations and hacking groups and individuals.
In addition, if the security measures of our customers are compromised, even without any actual compromise of our own systems or security measures, we may face negative publicity or reputational harm if our customers or anyone else incorrectly attributes the blame for such security breaches to us, our products and services, or our systems.
