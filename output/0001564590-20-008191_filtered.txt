Cybersecurity attacks on any of our facilities, or those of third parties, may result in potential liability or reputational damage or otherwise adversely affect our business.
Cybersecurity incidents are increasing in frequency and magnitude.
These incidents may include, but are not limited to, installation of malicious software, phishing, credential attacks, unauthorized access to data and other advanced and sophisticated cybersecurity breaches and threats, including threats that increasingly target critical operations technologies and process control networks.
Any cybersecurity attacks that affect our facilities or operations, our customers or any financial data could have a material adverse effect on our business.
In addition, cyber-attacks on our customer and employee data may result in a financial loss and may negatively impact our reputation.
Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer such attacks or operational system failures.
