Information technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business.
In addition, breaches of our data security systems, including by cyber-attacks, could result in the unintended public disclosure or the misappropriation of our proprietary information or personal and confidential information, about our employees, consumers who view our homes, home buyers, mortgage loan applicants and business partners, requiring us to incur significant expense to address and resolve these kinds of issues.
Depending on its nature, a particular breach or series of breaches of our systems may result in the unauthorized use, appropriation or loss of confidential or proprietary information on a one-time or continuing basis, which may not be detected for a period of time.
In recent years, we have been subject to cyber incidents including an attack that temporarily disrupted access to certain of our systems and an incident involving identity theft through the unauthorized access of one of our third-party service providerâ€™s information systems.
However, as a result of a widespread increase in the frequency and number of cyber-attacks, we expect that we will continue to be the target of additional and increasingly sophisticated cyber-attacks and data security breaches, and the safeguards we have designed to help prevent these incidents from occurring may not be successful.
Any further increase in the frequency or scope of cyber-attacks may exacerbate these data security risks.
If we experience additional cyber-attacks or data security breaches in the future, we could suffer material liabilities, our reputation could be materially damaged, and our operations could be materially disrupted.
