Information technology system failures or breaches of our network security could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.
Our operations depend upon our ability to protect our computer equipment and systems against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external security breaches, viruses, worms and other disruptive problems.
Any damage or failure of our computer systems or network infrastructure that causes an interruption in our operations, or any unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential information, including as a result of hacking, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Although we employ both internal resources and external consultants to conduct auditing and testing for weaknesses in our systems, controls, firewalls and encryption and intend to maintain and upgrade our security technology and operational procedures to prevent such damage, breaches or other disruptive problems, there can be no assurance that these security measures will be successful.
