Information technology failures and data security breaches could harm our business.
There has been an increase in cyber-attacks during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Breaches of our data security systems, including by cyber-attacks, could result in the unintended public disclosure or the misappropriation of our proprietary information or personal and confidential information, about our employees, consumers who view our homes, homebuyers or business partners, requiring us to incur significant expense to address and resolve such issues.
We maintain insurance coverage for potential breaches but the costs to remedy a breach may not be fully covered by our insurance.
We provide employee awareness training of cybersecurity threats and utilize information technology security experts to assist us in our evaluations of the effectiveness of the security of our information technology systems, and we regularly enhance our security measures to protect our systems and data.
We use various encryption, tokenization and authentication technologies to mitigate cybersecurity risks and have increased our monitoring capabilities to enhance early detection and rapid response to potential cyber threats.
