These information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious attack, which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns, and could involve claims against us by private parties and/or governmental agencies.
HIPAA requires, among other things, the implementation of various recordkeeping, operational, notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information, limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches.
Security risks generally associated with our information systems and our technology products and services could materially adversely affect our business, and our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if our information systems (or third-party systems we rely on) are interrupted, damaged by unforeseen events, are subject to cyberattacks or fail for any extended period of time.
Information security risks have generally increased in recent years, and a cyberattack that bypasses our IS security systems causing an IS security breach may lead to a material disruption of our IS business systems and/or the loss of business information resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.
In addition, we develop products and provide services to our customers that are technology-based, and a cyberattack that bypasses the IS security systems of our products or services causing a security breach and/or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products or services could also cause significant reputational harm, and actual or perceived vulnerabilities may lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies.
Additionally, legislative or regulatory action related to cybersecurity may increase our costs to develop or implement new technology products and services.
Risks associated with these and other IS security breaches may include, among other things:
•
future results could be materially adversely affected due to the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential data or intellectual property;
•
operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of information systems and subsequent clean-up and mitigation activities;
•
procedures and safeguards must continually evolve to meet new IS challenges, and enhancing protections, and conducting investigations and remediation, may impose additional costs on us;
•
we may incur claims, fines and penalties, and costs for remediation, or substantial defense and settlement expenses; and
•
negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with our customers, partners or industry peers.
