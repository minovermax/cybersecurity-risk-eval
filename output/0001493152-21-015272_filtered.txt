These cybersecurity threat actors, whether internal or external to us, are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the Company’s information technology systems and data, including the information technology systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the Company conducts business.
Although we have implemented information technology controls and systems that are designed to protect information and mitigate the risk of data loss and other cybersecurity risks, such measures cannot entirely eliminate cybersecurity threats, and the enhanced controls we have installed may be breached.
If our information technology systems cease to function properly or our cybersecurity is breached, we could suffer disruptions to our normal operations.
A cyber-attack involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business associates, could negatively impact our operations in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, the following:
● Unauthorized access to seismic data, reserves information, strategic information, or other sensitive or proprietary information could have a negative impact on our ability to compete for oil and natural gas resources;
● A cyber-attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions which could delay or halt our major development projects;
● A cyber-attack on third-party gathering, pipeline, or rail transportation systems could delay or prevent our outside operators from transporting and marketing production, resulting in a loss of revenues;
● A cyber-attack which halts activities at a power generation facility or refinery using natural gas as feed stock could have a significant impact on the natural gas market, resulting in reduced demand for our production, lower natural gas prices, and reduced revenues;
● A deliberate corruption of our financial or operating data could result in events of non-compliance which could then lead to regulatory fines or penalties; and
All of the above could negatively impact our operational and financial results.
As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.
Additionally, the growth of cyber-attacks has resulted in evolving legal and compliance matters which impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time.
