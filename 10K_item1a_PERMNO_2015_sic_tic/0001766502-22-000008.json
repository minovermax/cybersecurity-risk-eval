Risk Factors\nThe following are important factors that could affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations, including those expressed in any forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our other filings with the SEC or in presentations such as telephone conferences and webcasts open to the public. You should carefully consider the following factors in conjunction with this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 8. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, may also become important factors that adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, or other risks that we are not aware of become material, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nSummary Risk Factors\nOur business faces significant risks. The risk factors described below are only a summary of the principal risk factors associated with an investment in us. These risks are more fully described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, including the following:\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\n\u2022Our recent growth rates may not be sustainable or indicative of our future growth and we may not be able to successfully manage the challenges to our future growth.\n\u2022The COVID-19 global pandemic and related government, private sector and individual consumer responsive actions may adversely affect our business operations, employee availability, financial performance, liquidity and cash flow for an unknown period of time.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic has had and may in the future have an adverse effect on our labor workforce availability and supply chain operations in ways that remain unpredictable.\n\u2022If we fail to acquire and retain new customers, or fail to do so in a cost-effective manner, we may be unable to increase net sales, improve margins and achieve profitability.\n\u2022The growth of our business depends on our ability to accurately predict consumer trends, successfully introduce new products and services, improve existing products and services, and expand into new offerings.\n\u2022Our continued success is largely dependent on positive perceptions of our company.\n\u2022We may be unable to accurately forecast net sales and appropriately plan our expenses in the future.\n\u2022Our estimate of the size of our addressable market may prove to be inaccurate.\n\u2022If we are not able to source additional, or strengthen our existing relationships with, suppliers, or if we lose any of our key suppliers, our business could be negatively impacted.\n\u2022Any changes in, or disruptions to, our shipping arrangements could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\u2022If we do not successfully optimize, operate and manage the expansion of the capacity of our fulfillment centers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.\n\u2022Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to provide our customers with a cost-effective platform that is able to respond and adapt to rapid changes in technology.\n\u2022We are subject to risks related to online payment methods.\n\u2022Any significant interruptions or delays in service on our website or mobile applications or any undetected errors or design faults could result in limited capacity, reduced demand, processing delays, and loss of customers or suppliers.\n\u2022Our failure or the failure of third-party service providers to protect our website, networks, and systems against cybersecurity incidents, or otherwise to protect our confidential information, could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\u2022Safety, quality, and health concerns could affect our business.\n\u2022Risks associated with our suppliers and our outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the United States (\u201cU.S.\u201d), could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\u2022We are subject to extensive governmental regulation and we may incur material liabilities under, or costs in order to comply with, existing or future laws and regulation, and our failure to comply may result in enforcements, recalls, and other adverse actions.\n\u2022We may inadvertently fail to comply with various state or federal regulations covering our pet health business, which may subject us to reprimands, sanctions, probations, fines, suspensions, or the loss of one or more of our licenses.\n\u2022Resistance from veterinarians to authorize prescriptions, or their attempts/efforts to discourage pet owners from purchasing from us could cause our sales to decrease and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Failure to comply with federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, marketing and advertising and consumer protection, or the expansion of current or the enactment of new laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection, advertising and consumer protection, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\u2022Our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to certain limitations.\n\u2022We may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights. Additionally, we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims or other allegations, which could result in substantial damages and diversion of management\u2019s efforts and attention.\n\u2022We may be subject to personal injury, workers\u2019 compensation, product liability, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, wage and hour, and other claims in the ordinary course of business.\n\u2022If we are unable to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly-qualified and skilled employees, our business could be harmed.\n\u2022Uncertainties in economic conditions and their impact on consumer spending patterns, particularly in the pet products market, could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\u2022Significant merchandise returns or refunds could harm our business.\n\u2022Severe weather, including hurricanes, earthquakes and natural disasters could disrupt normal business operations, which could result in increased costs and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\u2022Our failure to manage new acquisitions, investments or alliances, or to integrate them with our existing business, could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\u2022If we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in expanding our operations outside the U.S.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\n\u2022Competition in the pet products and services retail industry, especially Internet-based competition, is strong and presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.\n\u2022Government regulation of the Internet and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\n\u2022Restrictions in our revolving credit facility could adversely affect our operating flexibility.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\n\u2022Our stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance.\n\u2022The dual class structure of our common stock may adversely affect the trading market for our Class A common stock.\n\u2022We are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the rules of NYSE and, as a result, we rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements and the concentrated ownership of our common stock will prevent other stockholders from influencing significant decisions.\nGeneral Risk Factors\n\u2022Future litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\u2022If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nOur recent growth rates may not be sustainable or indicative of our future growth and we may not be able to successfully manage the challenges to our future growth.\nWe have experienced significant growth in recent periods. This rate of growth may not be sustainable or indicative of our future rate of growth. We believe that our continued growth in net sales will depend upon, among other factors, our ability to:\n\u2022acquire new customers who purchase products from us at the same rate and of the same type as our existing customer base;\n\u2022retain our customers and have them continue to purchase products from us at rates and in a manner consistent with their prior purchasing behavior;\n\u2022encourage customers to expand the categories of products they purchase from us, leading to increased net sales per active customer;\n\u2022increase the number of customers that use our Autoship subscription program;\n\u2022attract new vendors to supply quality products that we can offer to our customers at attractive prices;\n\u2022retain our existing vendors and have them supply additional quality products that we can offer to our customers at attractive prices;\n\u2022expand our proprietary brand product offering, including the launch of new brands and expansion into new offerings;\n\u2022increase the awareness of our brand;\n\u2022provide our customers and vendors with a superior experience;\n\u2022develop new features to enhance the consumer experience on our website and our mobile and tablet applications;\n\u2022respond to changes in consumer access to and use of the Internet and mobile devices;\n\u2022react to challenges from existing and new competitors;\n\u2022develop a scalable, high-performance technology and fulfillment infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably handle increased demand, as well as the deployment of new features and the sale of new products and services;\n\u2022fulfill and deliver orders in a timely way and in accordance with customer expectations, which may change over time;\n\u2022respond to macroeconomic trends and their impact on consumer spending patterns;\n\u2022hire, integrate and retain talented personnel;\n\u2022leverage our technological and operational efficiencies;\n\u2022invest in the infrastructure underlying our website and other operational systems, including with respect to data protection and cybersecurity; and\n\u2022expand into new offerings or new lines of business in which we do not have prior, or sufficient, operating experience, including sustaining continued expansion of Chewy Pharmacy or our pet healthcare category more generally.\nOur ability to improve margins and achieve profitability will also depend on the factors described above. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully manage any of the foregoing challenges to our future growth. Any of these factors could cause our net sales growth to decline and may adversely affect our margins and profitability. We have also benefited from increasing pet ownership and discretionary spending on pets. To the extent these trends slow or reverse, our net sales, margins and profitability could be adversely affected. Failure to continue our net sales growth or improve margins could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should not rely on our historical rate of net sales growth as an indication of our future performance.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic and related government, private sector and individual consumer responsive actions may adversely affect our business operations, financial performance, liquidity and cash flow for an unknown period of time.\nCOVID-19 and its variant strains continue to spread in the U.S., Canada, and in many other countries globally. Related government and private sector responsive actions have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business operations. It is impossible to predict the effect and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the situation continues to evolve and variant strains of the virus have led to increased uncertainty. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business will depend on future developments that are uncertain and unpredictable, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, its impact on capital and financial markets, the continued timing of widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines, the willingness of individuals to become vaccinated, the efficacy of vaccinations, virus mutations and variants, the length of time COVID-19 related restrictions continue to stay in place or are reinstituted and for economic and operating\nconditions to return to prior levels, together with resulting consumer behaviors, and numerous other uncertainties, all of which remain uncertain. Any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to execute and capitalize on our strategies for a period of time that is currently unknown.\nOur plans to open new fulfillment centers or to expand the capacity of our existing fulfillment centers over the next few years may also be delayed or made more costly by the continuing spread of COVID-19 and variant strains, and related macroeconomic impacts. Disruptions to the operations of our fulfillment centers and delays or increased costs in the expansion of our fulfillment center capacity may negatively impact our financial performance and slow our future growth.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had and may in the future continue to have an adverse effect on our labor workforce availability and supply chain operations in unpredictable ways.\nThe spread of COVID-19 and its variant strains has disrupted the global supply chain and may cause disruptions to our operations. Employee availability may be affected if a significant number of employees are quarantined or if they are otherwise limited in their ability to work at our locations or travel. Future actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by federal, state or local authorities, including those that order the shutdown of non-essential businesses or limit the ability of our employees to travel to work, could impact our ability to take or fulfill our customers\u2019 orders and operate our business. If surges related to the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemic, epidemic or similar outbreak outpace our capacity or occur at unexpected times, we may be unable to fully meet our customers\u2019 demands for our products.\nWe may face labor shortages at our fulfillment centers due to factors directly or indirectly related to COVID-19, which may adversely affect our results of operations. If any of our fulfillment centers were to shut down, suffer substantial labor shortages, or lose significant capacity for any reason, our operations would likely be significantly disrupted. We compete with other retailers for the personnel to staff our fulfillment centers, some of whom are larger than us and have access to greater capital resources than we do. If we are unable to successfully recruit and retain personnel to staff our fulfillment centers, we may face labor shortages or be forced to increase wages and enhance benefits for such personnel, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business relies on an efficient and effective supply chain, including the transportation of our products, as well as the effective functioning of our fulfillment centers. Any interruption or malfunction in our fulfillment operations that could negatively affect the flow or availability of our products and result in difficulties in timely obtaining product from vendors and transportation of those products to our fulfillment center could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our personnel are working remotely and it is possible that this could have a negative impact on the execution of our business plans and operations. If a natural disaster, power outage, connectivity issue, or other event occurred that impacted our employees\u2019 ability to work remotely, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible, for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The increase in remote working may also result in consumer privacy, IT security and fraud concerns, increase our exposure to potential wage and hour issues, and decrease the cohesiveness of our teams and our ability to maintain our corporate culture. We expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a long-term effect on the nature of our office environments and remote working policies. While we believe that this will be a positive change over the long term, there may continue to be operational and workplace cultural challenges that may adversely affect our business, including talent retention. We are unable to predict if there will be any significant and continuing impact on our workforce as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIf we fail to acquire and retain new customers, or fail to do so in a cost-effective manner, we may be unable to increase net sales, improve margins and achieve profitability.\nOur success depends on our ability to acquire and retain new customers and to do so in a cost-effective manner. In order to expand our customer base, we must appeal to, and acquire, customers who have historically purchased their pet food and other pet products from other retailers, such as traditional brick and mortar retailers, the websites of our competitors, or our suppliers\u2019 own websites. We have made significant investments related to customer acquisition and expect to continue to spend significant amounts to acquire additional customers. We cannot assure you that the net sales from the new customers we acquire will ultimately exceed the cost of acquiring those customers. If we fail to deliver a quality shopping experience, or if consumers do not perceive the products we offer to be of high value and quality, we may be unable to acquire or retain customers. If we are unable to acquire or retain customers who purchase products in volumes sufficient to grow our business, we may be unable to generate the scale necessary to achieve operational efficiency and drive beneficial network effects with our suppliers. Consequently, our prices may increase (or may not decrease to levels sufficient to generate customer interest), our net sales may decrease and our margins and profitability may decline or not improve. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe believe that many of our new customers originate from word-of-mouth and other non-paid referrals from our customers. Therefore, we must ensure that our customers remain loyal to us in order to continue receiving those referrals. If our efforts to satisfy our customers are not successful, we may be unable to acquire new customers in sufficient numbers to continue to grow our business, and we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenses in order to acquire new customers.\nWe also use paid and non-paid advertising. Our paid advertising includes search engine marketing, direct mail, display, television, radio and magazine advertising, paid social media and product placement. Our non-paid advertising efforts include search engine optimization, non-paid social media and e-mail marketing. We drive a significant amount of traffic to our website via search engines and, therefore, rely on search engines. Search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user\u2019s search, such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our website can be negatively affected. Moreover, a search engine could, for competitive or other purposes, alter its search algorithms or results, causing our website to place lower in search query results.\nWe also drive a significant amount of traffic to our website via social networking or other e-commerce channels used by our current and prospective customers. As social networking and e-commerce channels continue to rapidly evolve, we may be unable to develop or maintain a presence within these channels. If we are unable to cost-effectively drive traffic to our website, our ability to acquire new customers and our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, if we fail to increase our net sales per active customer, generate repeat purchases or maintain high levels of customer engagement, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nTo manage our growth effectively, we must continue to implement our operational plans and strategies, improve and expand our infrastructure of people and information systems and expand, train and manage our employee base. We have rapidly increased employee headcount since our inception to support the growth in our business. To support our continued growth, we must effectively integrate, develop and motivate a large number of new employees. We face significant competition for personnel in the areas where our corporate offices are located, and certain other areas in which we have operations. Failure to manage our hiring needs effectively or successfully integrate our new hires may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the growth of our business places significant demands on our management and other employees. We are required to manage relationships with a growing number of suppliers, customers and other third parties. Our information technology systems, supply chain operations, and our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support future growth of our customer or supplier base. If we are unable to manage the growth of our organization effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe growth of our business depends on our ability to accurately predict consumer trends, successfully introduce new products and services, improve existing products and services, and expand into new offerings.\nOur growth depends, in part, on our ability to meet the requirements of our customers and the needs of their pets by successfully introducing new products and services, including our proprietary brand products, improving and repositioning our existing products and services, and expanding into new offerings. This, in turn, depends on our ability to predict and respond to evolving consumer trends, demands and preferences. The development and introduction of innovative new products and services and expansion into new offerings involves considerable costs. In addition, it may be difficult to establish new supplier or partner relationships and determine appropriate product selection when developing a new product, service or offering. Any new product, service or offering may not generate sufficient customer interest and sales to become profitable or to cover the costs of its development and promotion and, as a result, may reduce our operating income. In addition, any such unsuccessful effort may adversely affect our brand and reputation. If we are unable to anticipate, identify, develop or market products, services or new offerings, that respond to changes in consumer requirements and preferences, or if our new product or service introductions, repositioned products or services, or new offerings fail to gain consumer acceptance, we may be unable to grow our business as anticipated, our sales may decline and our margins and profitability may decline or not improve. As a result, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, while we plan to continue to invest in the development of our business, including in the expansion of our offerings of proprietary brand and healthcare products and services, we may be unable to maintain or expand our sales, respond timely to changes in regulations or enter into strategic relationships with market-leading suppliers and other market participants. We may encounter certain challenges in manufacturing our proprietary brand products, including the loss of key suppliers and product recalls. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of our proprietary brand and healthcare products and services for our customers is essential to developing and maintaining customer loyalty and brand awareness. Our proprietary brand products on average provide us with higher gross margins than the comparable third-party brand products that we sell. Accordingly, our inability to sustain the growth and sales of our proprietary brand offerings may materially and adversely affect our projected growth rates, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur continued success is largely dependent on positive perceptions of our company.\nWe believe that one of the reasons our customers prefer to shop at Chewy is the reputation we have built for providing an exceptional customer experience. To be successful in the future, we must continue to preserve, grow, and leverage the value of our reputation and our brand. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions of subjective qualities, and even isolated incidents may erode trust and confidence and have adverse effects on our business and financial results, particularly if they result in adverse publicity or widespread reaction on social media, governmental investigations, or litigation. Our brand could be adversely affected if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity. Failure to comply or accusations of failure to comply with ethical, social, product, labor, data privacy, and environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions. Any of these events could adversely affect our business.\nWe have a history of losses and may generate operating losses as we continue to expand our business.\nWe have a history of losses and may continue to generate operating losses in the near-term as we increase investment in our business. Furthermore, it is difficult for us to predict our future results of operations. We expect our operating expenses to increase over the next several years as we increase our advertising, launch new fulfillment centers, expand our offerings, hire additional personnel and continue to develop features on our website and mobile applications. In particular, we intend to continue to invest substantial resources in marketing to acquire new customers. Our operating expenses may also be adversely impacted by increased costs and delays in launching new fulfillment centers and expanding fulfillment center capacity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related macroeconomic impacts. If our future growth and operating performance fail to meet investor or analyst expectations, or if we have future negative cash flow or losses resulting from our investment in acquiring new customers, our financial condition and stock price could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to accurately forecast net sales and appropriately plan our expenses in the future.\nNet sales and results of operations are difficult to forecast because they generally depend on the volume, timing and type of orders we receive, all of which are uncertain. We base our expense levels and investment plans on our estimates of net sales and gross margins. We cannot be sure the same growth rates, trends, and other key performance metrics are meaningful predictors of future growth. If our assumptions prove to be wrong, we may spend more than we anticipate acquiring and retaining customers or may generate lower net sales per active customer than anticipated, either of which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur estimate of the size of our addressable market may prove to be inaccurate.\nData for retail sales of pet products is collected for most, but not all channels, and as a result, it is difficult to estimate the size of the market and predict the rate at which the market for our products will grow, if at all. While our market size estimate was made in good faith and is based on assumptions and estimates we believe to be reasonable, this estimate may not be accurate. If our estimates of the size of our addressable market are not accurate, our potential for future growth may be less than we currently anticipate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to source additional, or strengthen our existing relationships with, suppliers. In addition, the loss of any of our key suppliers would negatively impact our business.\nIn order to attract quality suppliers, we must demonstrate our ability to help our suppliers increase their sales; offer suppliers a high quality and cost-effective fulfillment process; and continue to provide suppliers a dynamic and real-time view of our demand and inventory needs.\nIf we are unable to provide our suppliers with a compelling return on investment, we may be unable to maintain and/or expand our supplier network, which would negatively impact our business.\nWe purchase significant amounts of products from a number of suppliers with limited supply capabilities. There can be no assurance that our current suppliers will be able to accommodate our anticipated growth or continue to supply current quantities at preferential prices. An inability of our existing suppliers to provide products in a timely or cost-effective manner could impair our growth and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For instance, as a result of the disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, some of our existing suppliers were not able to supply us with products in a timely or cost-effective manner. While we believe these disruptions to be temporary, their duration is uncertain and a continued inability of our existing suppliers to provide products or other product supply disruptions that may occur in the future could impair our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf any of our significant pet product suppliers discontinue selling to us at any time, whether due to the termination of an agreement or otherwise, or they discontinue offering us any preferential pricing or exclusive incentives, it could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, in our experience, it is challenging to persuade pet food buyers to switch to a different product, which could make it difficult to retain certain customers if we lose a pet food supplier, thereby exacerbating the negative impact of such loss on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe continually seek to expand our base of suppliers and to identify new pet products. If we are unable to identify or enter into distribution relationships with new suppliers or to replace the loss of any of our existing suppliers, we may experience a competitive disadvantage, our business may be disrupted and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nMost of the premium pet food brands that we purchase are not widely carried in supermarkets, warehouse clubs or mass merchants. If any premium pet food manufacturers were to make premium pet food products widely available in supermarkets or through mass merchants, or if the premium brands currently available to supermarkets and mass merchants were to increase their market share at the expense of the premium brands sold only through specialty pet food and supplies retailers, our ability to attract and retain customers and our competitive position may suffer. Furthermore, if supermarkets, warehouse clubs or mass merchants begin offering any of these premium pet food brands at lower prices, our sales and gross margin could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, several of the pet food brands we currently purchase and offer for sale to our customers are not offered by our closest specialty pet retailer competitors. However, we have not entered into formal exclusivity agreements with the suppliers for such brands. In the event these suppliers choose to enter into distribution arrangements with other specialty pet retailers or other competitors our sales could suffer and our business could be adversely affected.\nCertain of our principal suppliers currently provide us with incentives such as volume purchasing, trade discounts, cooperative advertising and market development funds. A reduction or discontinuance of these incentives would increase our costs and could reduce our profitability. Similarly, if one or more of our suppliers were to offer these incentives, including preferential pricing, to our competitors, our competitive advantage would be reduced, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nShipping is a critical part of our business and any changes in, or disruptions to, our shipping arrangements could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe currently rely on third-party national, regional and local logistics providers to deliver the products we offer on our website and mobile applications. If we are not able to negotiate acceptable pricing and other terms with these providers, or if these providers experience performance problems or other difficulties in processing our orders or delivering our products to customers, it could negatively impact our results of operations and our customers\u2019 experience. For example, changes to the terms of our shipping arrangements may adversely impact our margins and profitability. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship merchandise to customers may be negatively affected by factors beyond our and these providers\u2019 control, including inclement weather, fire, flood, power loss, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism or other events, such as labor disputes, financial difficulties, volatility in the prices of fuel, gasoline and commodities such as paper and packing supplies, system failures and other disruptions to the operations of the shipping companies on which we rely. We are also subject to risks of damage or loss during delivery by our shipping vendors. If the products ordered by our customers are not delivered in a timely fashion or are damaged or lost during the delivery process, our customers could become dissatisfied and cease buying products through our website and mobile applications, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, due to the continuing spread of COVID-19 and its variant strains and related work\nand travel restrictions, there may be disruptions and delays in national, regional and local shipping, which may negatively impact our customers\u2019 experience and our results or operations. The spread of COVID-19, and any future pandemic, epidemic or similar outbreak, may disrupt our suppliers and logistics providers and other third- party delivery agents, as their workers may be prohibited or otherwise unable to report to work and transporting products within regions or countries may be limited due to extended holidays, factory closures, port closures and increased border controls and closures, among other things. We have incurred and may continue to incur higher shipping costs due to various surcharges by third- party delivery agents on retailers related to the increased shipping demand resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak and any future pandemic, epidemic or similar outbreak. If we are unable to recover these additional costs, our margins and profitability may be adversely affected.\nIf we do not successfully optimize, operate and manage the expansion of the capacity of our fulfillment centers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed.\nIf we do not optimize and operate our fulfillment centers successfully and efficiently, it could result in excess or insufficient fulfillment capacity, an increase in costs or impairment charges or harm to our business in other ways. In addition, if we do not have sufficient fulfillment capacity or experience problems fulfilling orders in a timely manner, including as a result of disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our customers may experience delays in receiving their purchases, which could harm our reputation, our relationship with our customers and our results of operations. In addition, we have had to, and may again have to, pause operations at a fulfillment center in order to implement our COVID-19 sanitation procedures, which has resulted, and could again result in, delayed or canceled orders. These actions or other actions that we may take in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that have the effect of delaying or canceling orders could negatively impact our ability to maintain, protect or enhance our brand. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused disruptions to our supply chain operations and labor workforce availability. If we are unable to successfully optimize our fulfillment centers, it could increase costs and adversely affect our business.\nWe have designed and built our own fulfillment center infrastructure which is tailored to meet the specific needs of our business, including customizing third-party inventory and package handling software systems and automated fulfillment capabilities. If we continue to add fulfillment and warehouse capabilities, add new businesses or categories with different fulfillment requirements or change the mix in products that we sell, our fulfillment network will become increasingly complex and operating it will become more challenging. Failure to successfully address such challenges in a cost-effective and timely manner could impair our ability to timely deliver our customers\u2019 purchases and could harm our reputation and ultimately, our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe anticipate the need to add additional fulfillment center capacity as our business continues to grow and our offerings expand. We cannot assure you that we will be able to locate suitable facilities on commercially acceptable terms in accordance with our expansion plans, nor can we assure you that we will be able to recruit qualified managerial and operational personnel to support our expansion plans. If we are unable to secure new facilities for the expansion of our fulfillment operations, recruit qualified personnel to support any such facilities, or effectively control expansion-related expenses, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we grow faster than we anticipate, we may exceed our fulfillment center capacity sooner than we anticipate, we may experience problems fulfilling orders in a timely manner or our customers may experience delays in receiving their purchases, which could harm our reputation and our relationship with our customers, and we would need to increase our capital expenditures more than anticipated and in a shorter time frame than we currently anticipate. Our ability to expand our fulfillment center capacity, including our ability to secure suitable facilities and recruit qualified employees, may be substantially affected by the spread of COVID-19 and its variant strains and related governmental orders and there may be delays or increased costs associated with such expansion as a result of the spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related macroeconomic impacts. Many of the expenses and investments with respect to our fulfillment centers are fixed, and any expansion of such fulfillment centers will require additional investment of capital. We expect to incur higher capital expenditures in the future for our fulfillment center operations as our business continues to grow. We would incur such expenses and make such investments in advance of expected sales, and such expected sales may not occur. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we are unable to provide our customers with a cost-effective platform that is able to respond and adapt to rapid changes in technology.\nThe number of people who access the Internet through devices other than personal computers, including mobile phones, handheld computers such as notebooks and tablets, video game consoles and television set-top devices, has increased dramatically in recent years. The versions of our website and mobile applications developed for these devices may not be compelling to consumers. Adapting our services and/or infrastructure to these devices as well as other new Internet, networking or telecommunications technologies could be time-consuming and could require us to incur substantial expenditures, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, as new mobile devices and platforms are released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing applications for alternative devices and platforms and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support and maintenance of such applications. If we are unable to attract consumers to our website or mobile applications through these devices or are slow to develop a version of our website or mobile applications that is more compatible with alternative devices, we may fail to capture a significant share of consumers in the pet food and accessory market and could also lose customers, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, we continually upgrade existing technologies and business applications and we may be required to implement new technologies or business applications in the future. The implementation of upgrades and changes requires significant investments. Our results of operations may be affected by the timing, effectiveness and costs associated with the successful implementation of any upgrades or changes to our systems and infrastructure. In the event that it is more difficult for our customers to buy products from us on their mobile devices, or if our customers choose not to buy products from us on their mobile devices or to use mobile products that do not offer access to our website, we could lose customers and fail to attract new customers. As a result, our customer growth could be harmed and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risks related to online payment methods.\nWe currently accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, PayPal, and gift cards and may offer new payment options over time. These payment options subject us to additional regulations and compliance requirements, and may also increase our exposure to fraud, criminal activity, and other risks. For certain payment methods, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (\u201cPCI DSS\u201d) and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. Failure to comply with PCI DSS or to meet other payment card standards may result in the imposition of financial penalties or the allocation by the card brands of the costs of fraudulent charges to us.\nFurthermore, as our business changes, we may be subject to different rules under existing standards, which may require new assessments that involve costs above what we currently pay for compliance. In the future, as we offer new payment options to consumers, including by way of integrating emerging mobile and other payment methods, we may be subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements and fraud. If we fail to comply with the rules or requirements of any provider of a payment method we accept, if the volume of fraud in our transactions limits or terminates our rights to use payment methods we currently accept, or if a data breach occurs relating to our payment systems, we may, among other things, be subject to fines or higher transaction fees and may lose, or face restrictions placed upon, our ability to accept credit card payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe also occasionally receive orders placed with fraudulent data. If we are unable to detect or control fraud, our liability for these transactions could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business depends on network and mobile infrastructure, our third-party data center hosting facilities, including cloud- service providers, other third-party providers, and our ability to maintain and scale our technology. Any significant interruptions or delays in service on our website or mobile applications or any undetected errors or design faults could result in limited capacity, reduced demand, processing delays, and loss of customers or suppliers.\nA key element of our strategy is to generate a high volume of traffic on, and use of, our website and mobile applications. Our reputation and ability to acquire, retain and serve our customers are dependent upon the reliable performance of our website and mobile applications and the underlying network infrastructure. As our customer base and the amount of information shared on our website and mobile applications continue to grow, we will need an increasing amount of network capacity and computing power. We have spent and expect to continue to spend substantial amounts on data centers, including cloud providers, and equipment and related network infrastructure to handle the traffic on our website and mobile applications. The operation of these systems is complex and could result in operational failures. In some cases, third-party cloud providers run their own platforms that we access, and we are, therefore, vulnerable to their service interruptions. In the event that the volume of traffic of our customers exceeds the capacity of our current network infrastructure or in the event that our customer base or the amount of traffic on our website and mobile applications grows more quickly than anticipated, we may be required to incur significant additional costs to enhance the underlying network infrastructure. Interruptions or delays in these systems, whether due to system failures, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, undetected errors, design faults or other unexpected events or causes, could affect the security or availability of our website and mobile applications and prevent our customers from\naccessing our website and mobile applications. If sustained or repeated, these performance issues could reduce the attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, the costs and complexities involved in expanding and upgrading our systems may prevent us from doing so in a timely manner and may prevent us from adequately meeting the demand placed on our systems. Any web or mobile platform interruption or inadequacy that causes performance issues or interruptions in the availability of our website or mobile applications could reduce consumer satisfaction and result in a reduction in the number of consumers using our products and services.\nWe depend on the development and maintenance of the Internet and mobile infrastructure. This includes maintenance of reliable Internet and mobile infrastructure with the necessary speed, data capacity and security, as well as timely development of complementary products, for providing reliable Internet and mobile access. We also use and rely on services from other third parties, such as our telecommunications services and credit card processors, and those services may be subject to outages and interruptions that are not within our control. Failures by our telecommunications providers may interrupt our ability to provide phone support to our customers and distributed denial-of-service (\u201cDDoS\u201d) attacks directed at our telecommunication service providers could prevent customers from accessing our website. In addition, we have in the past and may in the future experience down periods where our third-party credit card processors are unable to process the online payments of our customers, disrupting our ability to receive customer orders. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if for any reason the reliability of our Internet, telecommunications, payment systems and mobile infrastructure is compromised.\nWe currently rely upon third-party data storage providers, including cloud storage solution providers, including Amazon Web Services (\u201cAWS\u201d). Nearly all of our data storage and analytics are conducted on, and the data and content we create associated with sales on our website and mobile applications are processed through, servers hosted by these providers. We also rely on e-mail service providers, bandwidth providers, Internet service providers and mobile networks to deliver e-mail and \u201cpush\u201d communications to customers and to allow customers to access our website.\nAny damage to, or failure of, our systems or the systems of our third-party data centers, including cloud storage solution providers, or our other third-party providers could result in interruptions to the availability or functionality of our website and mobile applications. As a result, we could lose customer data and miss order fulfillment deadlines, which could result in decreased sales, increased overhead costs, excess inventory and product shortages. If for any reason our arrangements with our data centers, cloud storage solution providers or other third-party providers are terminated or interrupted, such termination or interruption could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide. We have designed certain of our software and computer systems to also utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services provided by AWS. Given this, along with the fact that we cannot rapidly switch our AWS operations to another cloud provider, any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted. We could experience additional expense in arranging for new facilities, technology, services and support. In addition, the failure of our third-party data centers, including cloud storage solution providers, or any other third-party providers to meet our capacity requirements could result in interruption in the availability or functionality of our website and mobile applications.\nThe satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our website, mobile applications, transaction processing systems and technology infrastructure are critical to our reputation and our ability to acquire and retain customers, as well as to maintain adequate customer service levels. Our net sales depend on the number of visitors who shop on our website and mobile applications and the volume of orders that we can handle. Unavailability of our website or of our mobile applications or reduced order fulfillment performance would reduce the volume of goods sold and could also materially and adversely affect consumer perception of our brand. Any slowdown or failure of our website, mobile applications or the underlying technology infrastructure could harm our business, reputation and our ability to acquire, retain and serve our customers.\nThe occurrence of a natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, data loss, computer virus, an act of terrorism, cyberattack, vandalism or sabotage, act of war or any similar event, or a decision to close our third-party data centers on which we normally operate or the facilities of any other third-party provider without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our website and mobile applications. Cloud computing, in particular, is dependent upon having access to an Internet connection in order to retrieve data. If a natural disaster, pandemic (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), blackout or other unforeseen event were to occur that disrupted the ability to obtain an Internet connection, we may experience a slowdown or delay in our operations. While we have some limited disaster recovery arrangements in place, our preparations may not be adequate to account for disasters or similar events that may occur in the future and may not effectively permit us to continue operating in the event of any problems with respect to our systems or those of our third-party data centers or any other third-party facilities. Our disaster recovery and data redundancy plans may be inadequate, and our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for the losses that\ncould occur. If any such event were to occur to our business, our operations could be impaired and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur reliance on software-as-a-service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) technologies from third parties may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on SaaS technologies from third parties in order to operate critical functions of our business, including financial management services, customer relationship management services, supply chain services and data storage services. If these services become unavailable due to extended outages or interruptions or because they are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms or prices, or for any other reason, our expenses could increase, our ability to manage our finances could be interrupted, our processes for managing sales of our offerings and supporting our customers could be impaired, our ability to communicate with our suppliers could be weakened and our ability to access or save data stored to the cloud may be impaired until equivalent services, if available, are identified, obtained and implemented, all of which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur failure or the failure of third-party service providers to protect our website, networks, and systems against cybersecurity incidents, or otherwise to protect our confidential information, could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs a result of our services being web based, we collect, process, transmit and store large amounts of data about our customers, employees, suppliers and others, including credit card information (which we don\u2019t store) and personally identifiable information, as well as other confidential and proprietary information. We also employ third-party service providers for a variety of reasons, including storing, processing and transmitting proprietary, personal and confidential information on our behalf. While we rely on tokenization solutions licensed from third parties in an effort to securely transmit confidential and sensitive information, including credit card numbers, advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries or other developments may result in the whole or partial failure of these solutions to protect confidential and sensitive information from being breached or compromised. Similarly, our security measures, and those of our third-party service providers, may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems or those of our third-party service providers. DDoS attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks, ransomware, social engineering, security breaches or other cybersecurity incidents and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by our website, networks and systems or that we or our third-party service providers otherwise maintain, including payment card systems, may subject us to fines or higher transaction fees or limit or terminate our access to certain payment methods. We and our service providers may not anticipate or prevent all types of attacks until after they have already been launched, and techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers. In addition, cybersecurity incidents can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships.\nBreaches of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers or any cybersecurity incident could result in unauthorized access to our website, networks and systems; unauthorized access to and misappropriation of consumer and/or employee information, including personally identifiable information, or other confidential or proprietary information of ourselves or third parties; viruses, worms, spyware or other malware being served from our website, networks or systems; deletion or modification of content or the display of unauthorized content on our website; interruption, disruption or malfunction of operations; costs relating to cybersecurity incident remediation, deployment of additional personnel and protection technologies, response to governmental investigations and media inquiries and coverage; engagement of third party experts and consultants; litigation, regulatory action and other potential liabilities. If any of these cybersecurity incidents occur, or there is a public perception that we, or our third-party service providers, have suffered such a breach, our reputation and brand could also be damaged and we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to alleviate problems caused by such cybersecurity incidents. As a consequence, our business could be materially and adversely affected and we could also be exposed to litigation and regulatory action and possible liability. In addition, any party who is able to illicitly obtain a customer\u2019s password could access the customer\u2019s transaction data or personal information. Any compromise or breach of our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could violate applicable privacy, data security and other laws, and cause significant legal and financial exposure, adverse publicity and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. This is more so since governmental authorities throughout the U.S. and around the world are devoting more attention to data privacy and security issues.\nWhile we maintain privacy, data breach and network security liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Additionally, even though we continue to devote significant resources to monitor and update our systems and implement information security measures to protect our systems, there can be no assurance that any controls and procedures we have in place will be sufficient to protect us from future cybersecurity incidents. Failure by us or our vendors to comply with data security requirements or rectify a security issue may result in class action litigation, fines and the imposition of restrictions on our ability to accept payment cards, which could adversely affect our operations. As cyber threats are continually evolving, our controls and procedures may become inadequate and we may be required to devote additional resources to modify or enhance our systems in the future. As a result, we may face interruptions to our systems, reputational damage, claims under privacy and data protection laws and regulations, customer dissatisfaction, legal liability, enforcement actions or additional costs, any and all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSafety, quality, and health concerns could affect our business.\nWe could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of our vendor supplied and proprietary brand food and hardgood products. All of our suppliers are required to comply with applicable product safety laws and we are dependent upon them to ensure such compliance. One or more of our suppliers, including manufacturers of our proprietary brand products, might not adhere to product safety requirements or our quality control standards. Any issues of product safety or allegations that our products are in violation of governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, issues involving products manufactured in foreign countries, could cause those products to be recalled. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether valid or not, may discourage consumers from buying the products we offer, or cause supplier production and delivery disruptions. The real or perceived sale of contaminated food products by us could result in product liability claims against our suppliers or us, expose us or our suppliers to governmental enforcement action or private litigation, or lead to costly recalls and a loss of consumer confidence, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, our products may be exposed to product recalls, and we may be subject to litigation, if they are alleged to cause or pose a risk of injury or illness or if they are alleged to have been mislabeled, misbranded or adulterated or to otherwise be in violation of governmental regulations. We may also voluntarily recall or withdraw products that we consider do not meet our standards, whether for palatability, appearance or otherwise, in order to protect our brand and reputation. While we carry product liability insurance, our insurance may not be adequate to cover all liabilities we may incur in connection with product liability claims. For example, punitive damages are generally not covered by insurance. In addition, we may be unable to continue to maintain our existing insurance, obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all, or secure additional coverage, which may result in future product liability claims being uninsured. Any of these factors could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks associated with our suppliers and our outsourcing partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S., could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe depend on a number of suppliers and outsourcing partners, a significant portion of which are located in Asia, to provide our customers with a wide range of products in a timely and efficient manner. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with our existing outsourcing partners or cannot identify or enter into relationships with new outsourcing partners to meet the manufacturing and assembly needs of our proprietary brand business, our proprietary brand business may be disrupted and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, political and economic instability, the financial stability of our suppliers and outsourcing partners, their ability to meet our standards, labor problems, the availability and prices of raw materials, merchandise quality issues, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, transport security, inflation, natural disasters and epidemics, among other factors, are beyond our control and may materially and adversely affect our suppliers and outsourcing partners and, in turn, our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, governments, public institutions and other organizations in countries and regions where there has been resurgence of COVID-19 are taking certain emergency measures to combat its spread and impact, including implementation of travel bans and closures of factories, schools, public buildings, businesses and other institutions. While vaccines have been approved for use in the U.S and many other countries, and vaccination efforts are underway, it remains difficult to assess or predict the ultimate impact of the resurgence of COVID-19 and the emergence and severity of COVID-19 variants. Our business has been affected by, and may continue to be affected by, disruptions or restrictions on our employees\u2019 and other service providers\u2019 ability to travel, temporary closures of our facilities, including one or more of our fulfillment centers or customer service centers, or the facilities of our suppliers and other vendors in our supply chain. We have suppliers around the world, including in China, the U.S. and other countries where there has been resurgence of COVID-19. If COVID-19 or any of its variant strains were to continue to spread widely in the U.S. or in any other country or region where we have a significant employee presence, facilities or critical operations, it could impair our ability to manage day-to-day operations and service our customers, increase our costs of operations and also result in, among other things, losses of revenue.\nIn addition to the potential direct effects on us of COVID-19 or any similar epidemic or pandemic, we could be materially adversely impacted, including from any disruption to critical vendor services or losses of business, if any of our suppliers face significant business disruptions as a result of COVID-19 or any similar outbreak.\nIn addition, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine could lead to disruption, instability and volatility in the global markets and industries that could negatively impact our operations. The U.S. government and other governments have imposed severe sanctions and export controls against Russia and Russian interests and threatened additional sanctions and controls. The impact of the conflict and any sanctions or other measures implemented as a result is currently unknown and could adversely affect our business, supply chain, partners or customers.\nMoreover, there is uncertainty regarding the future of international trade agreements and the U.S.\u2019 position on international trade. For example, the U.S. government has previously threatened to undertake a number of actions relating to trade with Mexico, including the imposition of escalating tariffs on goods imported into the U.S. from Mexico. In addition, the U.S. government has previously raised tariffs, and imposed new tariffs, on a wide range of imports of Chinese products. The U.S. federal government may also withdraw from or materially modify international trade agreements. Additional trade restrictions, including tariffs, quotas, embargoes, safeguards and customs restrictions, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of products available to us and to our suppliers based in the U.S. and may require us to modify our supply chain organization or other current business practices, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation and we may incur material liabilities under, or costs in order to comply with, existing or future laws and regulation, and our failure to comply may result in enforcements, recalls, and other adverse actions.\nWe are subject to a broad range of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations including those intended to protect public and worker health and safety, natural resources and the environment. Our operations, including our outsourced proprietary brand manufacturing partners, are subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d), the Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d), the Department of Agriculture (the \u201cUSDA\u201d) and by various other federal, state, local and foreign authorities regarding the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling and export of our products, including food safety standards. In addition, we and our outsourced proprietary brand manufacturing partners are subject to additional regulatory requirements, including environmental, health and safety laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety legislative and regulatory authorities and the National Labor Relations Board, covering such areas as discharges and emissions to air and water, the use, management, disposal and remediation of, and human exposure to, hazardous materials and wastes, and public and worker health and safety. These laws and regulations also govern our relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, terms and conditions of employment, working conditions and citizenship requirements. Violations of or liability under any of these laws and regulations may result in administrative, civil or criminal fines, penalties or sanctions against us, revocation or modification of applicable permits, licenses or authorizations, environmental, health and safety investigations or remedial activities, voluntary or involuntary product recalls, warning or untitled letters or cease and desist orders against operations that are not in compliance, among other things. Such laws and regulations generally have become more stringent over time and may become more so in the future, and we may incur (directly, or indirectly through our outsourced proprietary brand manufacturing partners) material costs to comply with current or future laws and regulations or in any required product recalls. Liabilities under, and/or costs of compliance, and the impacts on us of any non-compliance, with any such laws and regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, changes in the laws and regulations to which we are subject could impose significant limitations and require changes to our business, which may increase our compliance expenses, make our business more costly and less efficient to conduct, and compromise our growth strategy.\nAmong other regulatory requirements, the FDA reviews the inclusion of specific claims in pet food labeling. For example, pet food products that are labeled or marketed with claims that may suggest that they are intended to treat or prevent disease in pets would potentially meet the statutory definitions of both a food and a drug. The FDA has issued guidance containing a list of specific factors it will consider in determining whether to initiate enforcement action against such products if they do not comply with the regulatory requirements applicable to drugs. These factors include, among other things, whether the product is only made available through or under the direction of a veterinarian and does not present a known safety risk when used as labeled. While we believe that we market our products in compliance with the policy articulated in the FDA\u2019s guidance and in other claim-specific guidance, the FDA may disagree or may classify some of our products differently than we do and may impose more stringent regulations which could lead to alleged regulatory violations, enforcement actions and product recalls. In addition, we may produce new products in the future that may be subject to FDA pre-market review before we can market and sell such products.\nFrom time-to-time the FDA, the Association of American Feed Control Officials, or state regulatory authorities may enact a regulation, requirement or other guidance that impacts pet food packaging, labeling, or marketing materials. As a result, we may need to incur material costs to change our packaging, labeling, or marketing to comply with such regulation or requirement and could be subject to liabilities if we fail to timely comply with such requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition to enforcement actions initiated by government agencies, there has been an increasing tendency in the U.S. among pharmaceutical companies to resort to the courts and industry and self-regulatory bodies to challenge comparative prescription drug advertising on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive. Through the years, there has been a continuing expansion of specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures, and warning requirements with respect to the advertising for certain products.\nThese developments and others related to government regulation could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may inadvertently fail to comply with various state or federal regulations covering our pet health business, which may subject us to reprimands, sanctions, probations, fines, suspensions, or the loss of one or more of our licenses.\nThe sale and delivery of prescription pet medications and the provision of telehealth services are generally governed by federal and state laws and regulations, and are subject to extensive oversight by state and federal governmental authorities. Governmental authorities that regulate our business have broad latitude to make, interpret, and enforce the laws and regulations that govern us and continue to interpret and enforce those laws and regulations more strictly and more aggressively each year. We are party to a number of routine administrative complaints related to our pharmacy business. We cannot assure you that we will not be subject to reprimands, sanctions, probations or fines, or that one or more of our licenses will not be suspended or revoked, or our ability to offer telehealth services will not be challenged, in connection with these complaints or otherwise. We may also be the subject of administrative complaints in the future.\nOur pharmacy business also involves the provision of professional services, including by pharmacists, that could expose us to professional liability claims. Our pharmacy business is subject to risks inherent in the dispensing, packaging and distribution of drugs and other health care products and services, including claims related to purported dispensing and other operational errors. Any failure to adhere to the laws and regulations applicable to the dispensing of drugs could subject our businesses to administrative, civil and criminal penalties.\nIf we are unable to maintain the licenses granted by relevant state authorities in connection with our pharmacy business, or if we become subject to actions by the FDA or other regulators, our dispensing of prescription medications to pet parents could cease and we may be subject to reprimands, sanctions, probations or fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nResistance from veterinarians to authorize prescriptions, or their attempts/efforts to discourage pet owners from purchasing from us could cause our sales to decrease and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe laws and regulations relating to the sale and delivery of prescription pet medications vary from state to state, but generally require that prescription pet medications be dispensed with authorization from a prescribing veterinarian. Some veterinarians resist providing our customers with a copy of their pet\u2019s prescription or resist authorizing the prescription to our pharmacy staff, thereby effectively preventing us from filling such prescriptions under applicable law. Certain veterinarians have also tried to discourage pet owners from purchasing from Internet mail order pharmacies. If the number of veterinarians who refuse to authorize prescriptions to our pharmacy staff increases, or if veterinarians are successful in discouraging pet owners from purchasing from us, our sales could decrease and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe face significant competition from veterinarians and other retailers and may not be able to compete profitably with them.\nWe compete directly and indirectly with veterinarians for the sale of pet medications and other health products. Veterinarians hold a competitive advantage because many pet owners may find it more convenient or preferable to purchase prescription medications directly from their veterinarians at the time of an office visit. We also compete directly and indirectly with both online and traditional retailers. Both online and traditional retailers may hold a competitive advantage because of longer operating histories, established brand names, greater resources, and/or a more established customer base.\nFailure to comply with federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, marketing and advertising and consumer protection, or the expansion of current or the enactment of new laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection, marketing and advertising and consumer protection, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on a variety of marketing techniques, including email and social media marketing and postal mailings, and we are subject to various laws and regulations that govern such marketing and advertising practices. A variety of federal and state laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data, particularly in the context of online advertising which we rely upon to attract new customers. In addition, we also collect, store, and transmit employees\u2019 health information for certain reasons, such as administering employee benefits; accommodating disabilities and injuries; complying with public health requirements; and mitigating the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace.\nLaws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, marketing and advertising, and consumer protection are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. These requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict with other rules or our practices. As a result, our practices may not have complied or may not comply in the future with all such laws, regulations, requirements and obligations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any federal or state privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations, industry self-regulatory principles, industry standards or codes of conduct, regulatory guidance, orders to which we may be subject or other legal obligations relating to privacy or consumer protection could adversely affect our reputation, brand and business, and may result in claims, liabilities, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities, customers, suppliers or others, or may require us to change our operations and/or cease using certain data sets. Any such claims, proceedings or actions could hurt our reputation, brand and business, force us to incur significant expenses in defense of such proceedings or actions, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, result in a loss of customers and suppliers and result in the imposition of monetary penalties. We may also be contractually required to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance with any laws, regulations or other legal obligations relating to privacy or consumer protection or any inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure of data that we store or handle as part of operating our business.\nFederal and state governmental authorities continue to evaluate the privacy implications inherent in the use of third-party \u201ccookies\u201d and other methods of online tracking for behavioral advertising and other purposes. The U.S. government and state governments have enacted, have considered or are considering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict the ability of companies and individuals to engage in these activities, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can employ cookies or other electronic tracking tools or the use of data gathered with such tools. Additionally, some providers of consumer devices and web browsers have implemented, or announced plans to implement, means to make it easier for Internet users to prevent the placement of cookies or to block other tracking technologies, which could if widely adopted result in the use of third-party cookies and other methods of online tracking becoming significantly less effective. The regulation of the use of these cookies and other current online tracking and advertising practices or a loss in our ability to make effective use of services that employ such technologies could increase our costs of operations and limit our ability to acquire new customers on cost-effective terms and consequently, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies, or self-regulatory organizations, may expand current laws or regulations, enact new laws or regulations or issue revised rules or guidance regarding privacy, data protection, consumer protection, and advertising. For example, in June 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, and allows consumers to opt out of selling their data to third parties and provides a new cause of action for data breaches. Further, on November 3, 2020, the California Privacy Rights Act (the \u201cCPRA\u201d) was voted into law by California residents. The CPRA significantly amends the CCPA, and imposes additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It also creates a new California data protection agency specifically tasked to enforce the law, which could result in increased regulatory scrutiny of businesses conducting activities in California in the areas of data protection and security. The substantive requirements for businesses subject to the CPRA will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and become enforceable on July 1, 2023. Similar laws have been proposed in other states and at the federal level, and if passed, such laws may have potentially conflicting requirements that would make compliance challenging. Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. Consumer protection laws require us to publish statements that describe how we handle personal data and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal data. If such information that we\npublish is considered untrue, we may be subject to government claims of unfair or deceptive trade practices, which could lead to significant liabilities and consequences. Further, according to the FTC, violating consumers\u2019 privacy rights or failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers\u2019 personal data secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Each of these privacy, security, and data protection laws and regulations, and any other such changes or new laws or regulations, could impose significant limitations, require changes to our business, impose fines and other penalties or restrict our use or storage of personal information, which may increase our compliance expenses and make our business more costly or less efficient to conduct. Any such changes could compromise our ability to develop an adequate marketing strategy and pursue our growth strategy effectively, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to certain limitations.\nOur ability to use our federal and state net operating losses to offset potential future taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due is dependent upon our generation of future taxable income, and we cannot predict with certainty when, or whether, we will generate sufficient taxable income to use all of our net operating losses. In addition, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), contains rules that impose an annual limitation on the ability of a company with net operating loss carryforwards that undergoes an ownership change, which is generally any change in ownership of more than 50% of its stock (by value) over a three-year period, to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards in years after the ownership change. These rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes among holders owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the shares of stock of a company or any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of shares of stock by such company. If a company\u2019s income in any year is less than the annual limitation prescribed by Section 382 of the Code, the unused portion of such limitation amount may be carried forward to increase the limitation (and net operating loss carryforward utilization) in subsequent tax years.\nWe experienced an ownership change related to PetSmart\u2019s acquisition of us that will result in an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Code, but we do not expect such limitation to have a material adverse effect on our ability to utilize net operating losses. In addition, if we were to undergo a further ownership change as a result of future transactions involving our common stock, including a follow-on offering of our common stock or purchases or sales of common stock between 5% holders, our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to additional limitation under Section 382 of the Code. As a result, a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards may expire before we are able to use them. If we are unable to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards, there may be a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nIn addition to the aforementioned federal income tax implications pursuant to Section 382 of the Code, most states follow the general provisions of Section 382 of the Code, either explicitly or implicitly resulting in separate state net operating loss limitations.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights. Additionally, we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims or other allegations, which could result in substantial damages and diversion of management\u2019s efforts and attention.\nWe regard our brand, customer lists, trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success. We rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection, agreements and other methods with our employees and others to protect our proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products are, or may be made, available. The protection of our intellectual property rights may require the expenditure of significant financial, managerial and operational resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights, and we may be unable to broadly enforce all of our intellectual property rights. Any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. Our patent and trademark applications may never be granted. Additionally, the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may be unable to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. Even if issued, there can be no assurance that these patents will adequately protect our intellectual property, as the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of patent and other intellectual property rights are uncertain. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or intellectual property rights. Furthermore, our confidentiality agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of our proprietary information, technologies and processes and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information.\nWe might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. For example, we may initiate claims or litigation against others for infringement, misappropriation or violation of our intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights or to establish the validity of such rights. However, we may be unable to discover or determine the extent of any infringement, misappropriation or other violation of our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights. Despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon, misappropriating or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, our technology platform may use open-source software. The use of such open-source software may subject us to certain conditions, including the obligation to offer, distribute, or disclose our technology platform for no or reduced cost, make the proprietary source code subject to open-source software licenses available to the public, license our software and systems that use open-source software for the purpose of making derivative works, or allow reverse assembly, disassembly, or reverse engineering. We monitor our use of open-source software to avoid subjecting our technology platform to conditions we do not intend. However, if our technology platform becomes subject to such unintended conditions, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThird parties have from time to time claimed, and may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. These claims, whether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming, result in considerable litigation costs, require significant amounts of management time or result in the diversion of significant operational resources and expensive changes to our business model, result in the payment of substantial damages or injunctions against us, or require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements, if available. In addition, we may be unable to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us, or at all, licenses or other rights with respect to intellectual property we do not own. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. Any payments we are required to make and any injunctions we are required to comply with as a result of these claims could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to personal injury, workers\u2019 compensation, product liability, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, wage and hour, and other claims in the ordinary course of business.\nOur business involves a risk of personal injury, workers\u2019 compensation, product liability, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, wage and hour, and other claims in the ordinary course of business. Product liability claims from customers and product recalls for merchandise alleged to be defective or harmful could lead to the disposal or write-off of merchandise inventories, the incurrence of fines or penalties, and damage to our reputation. We maintain general liability insurance with a self-insured retention and workers\u2019 compensation insurance with a deductible for each occurrence. We also maintain umbrella insurance above the primary general liability and product liability coverage. In many cases, we have indemnification rights against the manufacturers of our products and are entitled to coverage under their products liability insurance. Our ability to recover costs and damages under such insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the financial viability of the insurers, manufacturers, and the specific allegations of a claim. No assurance can be given that our insurance coverage or the manufacturers\u2019 indemnity will be available or sufficient in any claims brought against us.\nAdditionally, we are subject to U.S. federal, state, and local employment laws that expose us to potential liability if we are determined to have violated such employment laws, including but not limited to, laws pertaining to minimum wage rates, overtime pay, discrimination, harassment, and wrongful termination. Compliance with these laws, including the remediation of any alleged violation, may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe rely on the performance of members of management and highly skilled personnel, and if we are unable to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees, our business could be harmed.\nOur ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent on the services of our senior management and other key personnel. In addition, our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. The current market for such positions is highly competitive. Qualified individuals are in high demand and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. In addition, the loss of any of our senior management or other key employees or our inability to recruit and develop mid-level managers could materially and adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and we may be unable to find adequate replacements. Other than our CEO, CFO and certain other senior executives, all of our employees are at-will employees, meaning that they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. If we fail to retain talented senior management and other key personnel, or if we do not succeed in attracting highly-qualified employees or\nmotivating and retaining existing employees, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nUncertainties in economic conditions and their impact on consumer spending patterns, particularly in the pet products market, could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur results of operations are sensitive to changes in certain macro-economic conditions that impact consumer spending on pet products and services. Some of the factors that may affect consumer spending on pet products and services include consumer confidence, levels of unemployment, inflation, interest rates, tax rates and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. We may experience declines in sales or changes in the types of products sold during economic downturns. Any material decline in the amount of consumer spending or other adverse economic changes could reduce our sales, and a decrease in the sales of higher-margin products could reduce profitability and, in each case, harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSignificant merchandise returns or refunds could harm our business.\nWe allow our customers to return products or offer refunds, subject to our return and refunds policy. If merchandise returns or refunds are significant or higher than anticipated and forecasted, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, we modify our policies relating to returns or refunds from time to time, and may do so in the future, which may result in customer dissatisfaction and harm to our reputation or brand, or an increase in the number of product returns or the amount of refunds we make.\nSevere weather, including hurricanes, earthquakes and natural disasters could disrupt normal business operations, which could result in increased costs and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSeveral of our fulfillment centers, customer service centers, and corporate offices are located in Florida, Texas, and other areas that are susceptible to hurricanes, sea-level rise, earthquakes, and other natural disasters. Recent intense weather conditions may cause property insurance premiums to significantly increase in the future. We recognize that the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and other climatic changes may continue to increase, and as a result, our exposure to these events may increase. Therefore, as a result of the geographic location of our properties, we face risks, including higher costs, such as uninsured property losses and higher insurance premiums, as well as unexpected disruptions to our business and operations, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may seek to grow our business through acquisitions of, or investments in, new or complementary businesses, facilities, technologies, offerings or products, or through strategic alliances, and the failure to manage these acquisitions, investments or other strategic alliances, or to integrate them with our existing business, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe have acquired and invested in a number of businesses, and we may in the future consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in new or complementary businesses, facilities, technologies, offerings, or products, or enter into strategic alliances, that may enhance our capabilities, expand our outsourcing and supplier network, complement our current products and services or expand the breadth of our markets. Acquisitions, investments and other strategic alliances involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022problems integrating the acquired business, facilities, technologies or products, including issues maintaining uniform standards, procedures, controls and policies;\n\u2022unanticipated costs associated with acquisitions, investments or strategic alliances;\n\u2022losses we may incur as a result of declines in the value of an investment or as a result of incorporating an investee\u2019s financial performance into our financial results;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention from our existing business;\n\u2022adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers, outsourced proprietary brand manufacturing partners, retail partners and distribution customers;\n\u2022risks associated with entering new markets in which we may have limited or no experience;\n\u2022potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses;\n\u2022the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face;\n\u2022potential unknown liabilities associated with a business we acquire or in which we invest; and\n\u2022increased legal and accounting compliance costs.\nOur ability to successfully grow through strategic transactions depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable target businesses, facilities, technologies and products and to obtain any necessary financing. These efforts could be expensive and time-consuming and may disrupt our ongoing business and prevent management from focusing on our operations. As a result of future strategic transactions, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt (which may only be available on unfavorable terms, if at all), contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business. If we are unable to identify suitable acquisitions, investments or strategic relationships, or if we are unable to integrate any acquired businesses, facilities, technologies, offerings and products effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Also, while we employ several different methodologies to assess potential business opportunities, the new businesses or investments may not meet or exceed our expectations or desired objectives.\nOur business results could be adversely affected if our entry into the pet insurance market is unsuccessful.\nWe intend to expand our business into the pet insurance market. As a new entrant, we may be faced with many competitive challenges including competing successfully with incumbent pet insurance providers who have long operating histories, large customer bases, high brand recognition and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. To compete effectively, we may need to invest significant resources to create brand awareness and build our reputation in the market, and our efforts at building, maintaining and enhancing our reputation could fail. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or enhance our reputation, and failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. If we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brand cost-effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nRegulation of the sale of medical insurance for cats and dogs is subject to change, and future regulations could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe laws and regulations governing the offer, sale and purchase of medical insurance for cats and dogs are subject to change, and future changes may be adverse to our business. For example, if a jurisdiction were to alter the requirements for obtaining or maintaining an agent's license in connection with the enrollment of a member, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Some states in the U.S. have adopted, and others are expected to adopt, new laws and regulations related to the insurance industry. It is difficult to predict how these or any other new laws and regulations will impact our business, but, in some cases, changes in insurance laws, regulations and guidelines may be incompatible with various aspects of our business and require that we make significant modifications to our existing technology or practices, which may be costly and time-consuming to implement and could also harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in expanding our operations outside the U.S.\nOur strategy may include the expansion of our operations to international markets. Although some of our executive officers have experience in international business from prior positions, we have little experience with operations outside the U.S. Our ability to successfully execute this strategy is affected by many of the same operational risks we face in expanding our U.S. operations. In addition, our international expansion may be adversely affected by: our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers; our ability to staff, develop, and manage foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences; our ability to obtain and protect relevant trademarks, domain names, and other intellectual property; and local laws and customs, legal and regulatory constraints, political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we operate or intend to operate in the future, including limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions. Risks inherent in expanding our operations internationally also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences, domestic and international tariffs and other barriers to trade. Further, the extent and impact of any sanctions imposed in connection with the escalation of hostilities between Russia and Ukraine may cause additional financial market volatility and impact the global economy and also impact our strategy of expansion into international markets.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nCompetition in the pet products and services retail industry, especially Internet-based competition, is strong and presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.\nThe pet products and services retail industry is very competitive. We compete with pet product retail stores, supermarkets, warehouse clubs and other mass and general retail and online merchandisers, including e-tailers, many of which are larger than us and have significantly greater capital resources than we do. We also compete with a number of specialty pet supply stores and independent pet stores, catalog retailers and other specialty e-tailers.\nMany of our current competitors have, and potential competitors may have, longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger fulfillment infrastructures, greater technical capabilities, significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources and larger customer bases than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to derive greater net sales and profits from their existing customer base, acquire customers at lower costs or respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in consumer preferences or habits. These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies (including but not limited to predatory pricing policies and the provision of substantial discounts), which may allow them to build larger customer bases or generate net sales from their customer bases more effectively than we do.\nWe have been able to compete successfully by differentiating ourselves from our competitors by providing a large selection of high-quality pet food, treats and supplies, competitive pricing, convenience and exceptional customer service. If changes in consumer preferences decrease the competitive advantage attributable to these factors, or if we fail to otherwise positively differentiate our product offering or customer experience from our competitors, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In particular, a key component of our business strategy is to rely on our reputation for exceptional customer service. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring, training, and retaining employees who share our core values of delivering superior service to our customers and caring about pet parents and their needs. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or otherwise, our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to maintain our current levels of customer service and our reputation for customer service as we grow or otherwise, our net sales may not continue to grow or may decline, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe compete directly and indirectly with veterinarians for the sale of pet medications and other pet health products. Veterinarians hold a competitive advantage over us because many pet parents may find it more convenient or preferable to purchase these products directly from their veterinarians at the time of an office visit. We also compete directly and indirectly with both online and traditional pet pharmacies. Both online and traditional pet pharmacies may hold a competitive advantage over us because of longer operating histories, established brand names, greater resources, and/or an established customer base. Online pet pharmacies may have a competitive advantage over us because of established affiliate relationships that drive traffic to their website. Traditional pet pharmacies may hold a competitive advantage over us because pet parents may prefer to purchase these products from a store instead of online. In addition, we face growing competition from online and multichannel pet pharmacies, some of whom may have a lower cost structure than ours, as customers now routinely use computers, tablets, smartphones, and other mobile devices and mobile applications to shop online and compare prices and products in real time. In order to effectively compete in the future, we may be required to offer promotions and other incentives, which may result in lower operating margins and in turn adversely affect our results of operations. We also face a significant challenge from our competitors forming alliances with each other, such as those between online and traditional pet pharmacies. These relationships may enable both their retail and online stores to negotiate better pricing and better terms from suppliers by aggregating the demand for products and negotiating volume discounts, which could be a competitive disadvantage to us.\nWe expect competition in the pet products and services retail industry, in particular Internet-based competition, generally to continue to increase. If we fail to compete successfully, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and e-commerce. Existing and future regulations and laws could impede the growth of the Internet, e-commerce or mobile commerce, which could adversely affect our growth. These regulations and laws may involve taxes, tariffs, privacy and data security, anti-spam, content protection, electronic contracts and communications, consumer protection and Internet neutrality. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes and consumer privacy apply to the Internet as the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the Internet or e-commerce. It is possible that general business regulations and laws, or those specifically governing the Internet or e-commerce, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. We cannot be sure that our practices have complied, comply or will comply fully with all such laws and regulations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation, a loss in business and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities, customers, suppliers or others. Any such proceeding or action could hurt our reputation, force us to spend significant amounts in defense of these proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, decrease the use of our website and mobile applications by consumers and suppliers and may result in the imposition of monetary liabilities. We may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance with any such laws or regulations. As a result, adverse developments with respect to these laws and regulations could substantially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in tax treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce may adversely affect the commercial use of our website and mobile applications and our financial results.\nOn June 21, 2018, the Supreme Court of the United States (the \u201cSupreme Court\u201d) overturned a prior decision under which e-tailers had not been required to collect sales tax unless they had a physical presence in the buyer\u2019s state. As a result, a state may now enforce or adopt laws requiring e-tailers to collect and remit sales tax even if the e-tailer has no physical presence within the taxing state provided certain conditions are met. In response, an increasing number of states have adopted or are considering adopting laws or administrative practices, with or without notice, that impose sales or similar value added or consumption taxes on e-commerce activity, as well as taxes on all or a portion of gross revenue or other similar amounts earned by an e-tailer from sales to customers in the state. Since October 28, 2018, we have withheld sales tax to the extent required in all states to which we ship. If any state were to assert that we have any liability for sales tax for prior periods and seek to collect such tax in arrears and/or impose penalties for past non-payment of taxes, it could have an adverse effect on us. New legislation or regulations, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions, including other countries whose laws do not currently apply to our business, or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and commercial online services could similarly result in significant additional taxes on our business. These taxes or tax collection obligations could have an adverse effect on us, including by way of creating additional administrative burdens on us. For instance, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision and the enactment and enforcement of laws resulting therefrom could also impact where we are required to file state income taxes. As a result, our effective income tax rate as well as the cost and growth of our business could be materially and adversely affected, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, there is a possibility that we may be subject to significant fines or other payments for any past failures to comply with these requirements.\nWe are also subject to U.S. federal and state laws, regulations, and administrative practices that require us to collect information from our customers, vendors, merchants, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes and report such information to various government agencies. The scope of such requirements continues to expand, requiring us to develop and implement new compliance systems. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in significant penalties. We cannot predict the effect of current attempts to impose sales, income or other taxes on e-commerce. New or revised taxes would likely increase the cost of doing business online and decrease the attractiveness of selling products over the Internet. New taxes could also create significant increases in internal costs necessary to capture data and collect and remit taxes. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nRestrictions in our revolving credit facility could adversely affect our operating flexibility.\nOur revolving credit facility limits our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u2022make certain investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022pay dividends;\n\u2022incur certain liens or permit them to exist;\n\u2022enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022merge or consolidate with another company; and\n\u2022transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of assets.\nOur revolving credit facility also contains covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios. The provisions of our revolving credit facility may affect our ability to obtain future financing and to pursue attractive business opportunities and our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions. As a result, restrictions in our revolving credit facility could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with the provisions of our revolving credit facility could result in a default or an event of default that could enable our lenders to declare the outstanding principal of that debt, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable. If the payment of outstanding amounts under our revolving credit facility is accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay such amounts in full, and our stockholders could experience a partial or total loss of their investment. Please see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and the terms of our revolving credit facility may also restrict our ability to pay dividends.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Moreover, the terms of our revolving credit facility may restrict our ability to pay dividends, and any additional debt we may incur in the future may include similar restrictions. As a result, and for the foreseeable future, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with and Separation from PetSmart\nSince we are no longer controlled by PetSmart, we may be unable to continue to benefit from that relationship, which may adversely affect our operations and have a material adverse effect on us.\nAs of February 12, 2021, we were no longer controlled by PetSmart, although our company and PetSmart remain controlled by affiliates of BC Partners. Our relationship with PetSmart provided us with increased scale and reach. Since we are no longer controlled by PetSmart, we may incur increased costs and higher prices to our customers, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf affiliates of BC Partners sell a controlling interest in our company to a third party in a private transaction, you may not realize any change-of-control premium on shares of our Class A common stock and we may become subject to the control of a presently unknown third party. Substantial future sales by affiliates of BC Partners or others of our common stock, or the perception that such sales may occur, could also depress the price of our Class A common stock.\nAffiliates of BC Partners that control our company have the ability, should they choose to do so, to sell some or all of their shares of our common stock in a privately negotiated transaction or otherwise, which, if sufficient in size, could result in a change of control of our company. The ability of affiliates of BC Partners to sell their shares of our common stock, with no requirement for a concurrent offer to be made to acquire all of the shares of our Class A common stock that will be publicly traded hereafter, could prevent you from realizing any change-of-control premium on your shares of our Class A common stock that may otherwise accrue to affiliates of BC Partners on their sale of our common stock. Additionally, if affiliates of BC Partners sell their significant equity interest in our company, or if secured parties foreclose on any or all of the shares of Class B common stock beneficially owned by affiliates of BC Partners pursuant to the pledges that secure certain debt, including certain\nof PetSmart\u2019s credit facilities and indentures, we may become subject to the control of a presently unknown third party. Such third party may have conflicts of interest with those of other stockholders. In addition, if affiliates of BC Partners sell a controlling interest in our company to a third party, any outstanding indebtedness may be subject to acceleration and our commercial agreements and relationships could be impacted, all of which may adversely affect our ability to run our business as described herein and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have also granted certain registration rights to certain holders of our Class B common stock, including certain affiliates of BC Partners, pursuant to which they have the right to demand that we register Class A common stock beneficially owned by them under the Securities Act as well as the right to demand that we include any such shares in any registration statement that we file with the SEC, subject to certain exceptions.\nWe are unable to predict with certainty whether or when such holders of our Class B common stock will exercise its registration rights and/or sell a substantial number of shares of our common stock. The sale by affiliates of BC Partners of a substantial number of shares, or a perception that such sales could occur, could also significantly reduce the market price of our Class A common stock.\nConflicts of interest may arise because some of our directors own stock or other equity interests in PetSmart and hold management or board positions with PetSmart.\nSome of our directors directly or indirectly own equity interests in PetSmart. In addition, some of our directors are also directors or officers of PetSmart or its parent companies. Ownership of such equity interests by our directors and the presence of directors or officers of PetSmart or its parent companies on our board of directors could create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving both us and any one of them, or involving us and PetSmart, that could have different implications for any of these investors than they do for us. Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, none of our non-employee directors have a duty, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to refrain from engaging in the same or similar business activities or lines of business in which we are now engaged in or from otherwise competing with us. In addition, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we may be unable to take advantage of corporate opportunities presented to individuals who are directors of both us and our affiliates, including PetSmart. As a result, we may be precluded from pursuing certain advantageous transactions or growth initiatives.\nOur inability to resolve in a manner favorable to us any potential conflicts or disputes that arise between us and PetSmart or its subsidiaries with respect to our past and ongoing relationships may adversely affect our business and prospects.\nPotential conflicts or disputes may arise between PetSmart or its subsidiaries and us in a number of areas relating to our past or ongoing relationships, including:\n\u2022tax, employee benefit, indemnification and other matters arising from our relationship with PetSmart or its subsidiaries;\n\u2022business combinations involving us;\n\u2022the nature, quality and pricing of services PetSmart or its subsidiaries have agreed to provide us;\n\u2022business opportunities that may be attractive to us and PetSmart or its subsidiaries;\n\u2022intellectual property or other proprietary rights; and\n\u2022joint sales and marketing activities with PetSmart or its subsidiaries.\nThe resolution of any potential conflicts or disputes between us and PetSmart or its subsidiaries over these or other matters may be unfavorable for us.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nOur stock price has been, and may continue to be, volatile and may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nPrior to our initial public offering in June 2019, there had been no public market for our Class A common stock. The market price of our Class A common stock has fluctuated significantly in response to numerous factors and may continue to fluctuate for these and other reasons, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations;\n\u2022the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of our company, changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, results of operations or capital commitments;\n\u2022changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other retail or technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022trading volume of our Class A common stock;\n\u2022the inclusion, exclusion or removal of our Class A common stock from any indices;\n\u2022changes in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022transactions in our Class A common stock by directors, officers, affiliates and other major investors;\n\u2022lawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022changes in laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of debt or equity securities;\n\u2022short sales, hedging and other derivative transactions involving our capital stock;\n\u2022general economic conditions in the U.S.;\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events; and\n\u2022the other factors described in the sections of this report titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nThe stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. The market prices of securities of companies have experienced fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to their operating results. In the past, stockholders have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. Any similar litigation against us could result in substantial costs, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, and harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock may adversely affect the trading market for our Class A common stock.\nIn July 2017, S&P Dow Jones and FTSE Russell announced changes to their eligibility criteria for the inclusion of shares of public companies on certain indices, including the Russell 2000, the S&P 500, the S&P MidCap 400 and the S&P SmallCap 600, to exclude companies with multiple classes of shares of common stock from being added to these indices. As a result, our dual class capital structure would make us ineligible for inclusion in any of these indices, and mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and other investment vehicles that attempt to passively track these indices will not be investing in our stock. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that other stock indices will not take a similar approach to S&P Dow Jones or FTSE Russell in the future. Exclusion from indices could make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors and, as a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022permit the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;\n\u2022provide that a director may be removed only for cause and only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of the votes that all of our stockholders would be entitled to cast in an annual election of directors;\n\u2022require at least 75% of the votes that all of our stockholders would be entitled to cast in an annual election of directors in order to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws after the date on which the outstanding shares of Class B common stock represent less than 50% of the combined voting power of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock;\n\u2022eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders after the date on which the outstanding shares of Class B common stock represent less than 50% of the combined voting power of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock;\n\u2022prohibit stockholder action by written consent, instead requiring stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders, when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 50% of the combined voting power of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock;\n\u2022permit our board of directors, without further action by our stockholders, to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of preferred stock, the rights of which may be greater than the rights of our Class A common stock;\n\u2022restrict the forum for certain litigation against us to Delaware;\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022provide for a staggered board.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. As a result, these provisions may adversely affect the market price and market for our Class A common stock if they are viewed as limiting the liquidity of our stock or as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAffiliates of BC Partners control the direction of our business and the concentrated ownership of our common stock will prevent other stockholders from influencing significant decisions.\nAs of March 22, 2022, affiliates of BC Partners beneficially owned more than 50% of our outstanding shares of common stock and, together with its affiliates, exercised control over more than 95% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. So long as BC Partners and/or its affiliates remain our controlling stockholder they will be able to control, directly or indirectly, and subject to applicable law, all matters affecting us, including:\n\u2022any determination with respect to our business direction and policies, including the appointment and removal of officers and directors;\n\u2022any determinations with respect to mergers, business combinations or disposition of assets;\n\u2022compensation and benefit programs and other human resources policy decisions;\n\u2022the payment of dividends on our common stock; and\n\u2022determinations with respect to tax matters.\nBecause BC Partners and its affiliates\u2019 interests may differ from ours or from those of our other stockholders, actions that BC Partners or its affiliates take with respect to us, as our controlling stockholder, may not be favorable to us or our other stockholders, including holders of our Class A common stock. In addition, even if BC Partners and/or its affiliates were to control less than a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, it may be able to influence the outcome of such matters so long as it owns a significant portion of our common stock.\nIn addition, certain of our stockholders which are affiliated with BC Partners have granted, and in the future may grant, a security interest in shares of our common stock beneficially owned by them, to secure certain debt, including debt of PetSmart, each of which includes customary default provisions. In the event of a default under the agreements governing such debt, the secured parties may foreclose upon any and all shares of our common stock pledged to them. Future transfers by BC Partners and their affiliates of Class B common stock, which entitles each holder thereof to ten votes per share (including transfers by secured parties that foreclose on Class B common stock), will generally result in those shares converting on a one-to-one basis to Class A common stock, which entitles each holder thereof to one vote per share. As a result, such transfers will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long-term, which may include our directors and their affiliates.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the rules of NYSE and, as a result, qualify for, and rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nAs of March 22, 2022, affiliates of BC Partners control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are considered as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of the NYSE. Under these rules, a listed company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:\n\u2022the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022the requirement that our nominating and corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities;\n\u2022the requirement that our compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022the requirement for an annual performance evaluation of our corporate governance and compensation committees.\nWhile affiliates of BC Partners control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, we intend to rely on these exemptions and, as a result, will not have a majority of independent directors on our board of directors. Our nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees will also not consist entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, holders of our Class A common stock do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nFuture litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLawsuits and other administrative or legal proceedings that may arise in the course of our operations can involve substantial costs, including the costs associated with investigation, litigation and possible settlement, judgment, penalty or fine. In addition, lawsuits and other legal proceedings may be time consuming and may require a commitment of management and personnel resources that will be diverted from our normal business operations. Although we generally maintain insurance to mitigate certain costs, there can be no assurance that costs associated with lawsuits or other legal proceedings will not exceed the limits of insurance policies. Moreover, we may be unable to continue to maintain our existing insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all, or to secure additional coverage, which may result in costs associated with lawsuits and other legal proceedings being uninsured. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected if a judgment, penalty or fine is not fully covered by insurance.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from growing.\nIn the future, we could be required to raise capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business. We may sell Class A common stock, convertible securities and other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a\nmanner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell any such securities in subsequent transactions, investors in our Class A common stock may be materially diluted. New investors in such subsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and could reduce our operational flexibility or profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may be forced to raise funds on undesirable terms, or our business may contract or we may be unable to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. Tax laws, regulations and administrative practices in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without advance notice, due to economic, political and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles and interpretations, the mix and level of earnings in a given taxing jurisdiction or our ownership or capital structures.\nFurther, the U.S. federal income tax legislation enacted in Public Law No. 115-97 (the \u201cTax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d) is highly complex, subject to interpretation, and contains significant changes to U.S. tax law, including, but not limited to, a reduction in the corporate tax rate, significant additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, substantial revisions to the taxation of international operations, and limitations on the use of net operating losses generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The presentation of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our current interpretation of the provisions contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In the future, the Treasury Department and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) are expected to release regulations and interpretive guidance relating to the legislation contained in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Any significant variance of our current interpretation of such legislation from any future regulations or interpretive guidance could result in a change to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nUntil our initial public offering in June 2019, we were not subject to the internal control and financial reporting requirements that are required of a publicly-traded company. Beginning with the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, we are required to comply with the requirements of The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d). The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation, document our controls and perform testing of our key controls over financial reporting to allow management and our independent public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock would likely decline and we could be subject to lawsuits, sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any rules promulgated thereunder, as well as the rules of NYSE. The requirements of these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls for financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight are required, and, as a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns. These rules and regulations can also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified independent members of our board of directors. Additionally, these rules and regulations make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. Additionally, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. We may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. The increased costs of compliance with public company reporting requirements and our potential failure to satisfy these requirements can have a material adverse effect on our operations, business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 18727, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "CHWY"}
