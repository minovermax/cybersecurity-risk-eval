{"cik": "1590955", "company": "Paycom Software, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risk factors noted in this section and other factors noted throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those risks identified in Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d describe examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual outcomes may vary materially from those included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur business depends substantially on our clients\u2019 continued use of our applications, their purchases of additional applications from us and our ability to add new clients. Any decline in our clients\u2019 continued use of our applications or purchases of additional applications could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nIn order for us to maintain or improve our operating results, it is important that our current clients continue to use our applications and purchase additional applications from us, and that we add new clients. Our clients have no obligation to continue to use our applications, and may choose not to continue to use our applications at the same or higher level of service, if at all. In the past, some of our clients have elected not to continue to use our applications. Moreover, our clients generally have the right to cancel their agreements with us for any or no reason by providing 30 days prior written notice.\nOur client retention rates may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of client satisfaction with our applications, pricing, the prices of competing products or services, mergers and acquisitions affecting our client base, reduced hiring by our clients or reductions in our clients\u2019 spending levels. If our clients do not continue to use our applications, renew on less favorable terms, fail to purchase additional applications, or if we fail to add new clients, our revenues may decline, and our business, operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe market in which we participate is highly competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business, operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe market for HCM software is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and fragmented. We expect competition to intensify in the future with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants. Many of our current and potential competitors are larger and have greater brand name recognition, longer operating histories, more established relationships in the industry and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. As a result, some of these competitors may be able to:\n\u2022\nadapt more rapidly to new or emerging technologies and changes in client requirements;\n\u2022\ndevelop superior products or services, gain greater market acceptance and expand their product and service offerings more efficiently or rapidly;\n\u2022\nbundle products and services that we may not offer or in a manner that provides our competitors with a price advantage;\n\u2022\ntake advantage of acquisition and other opportunities for expansion more readily;\n\u2022\nmaintain a lower cost basis;\n\u2022\nadopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the promotion, marketing and sales of their products and services; and\n\u2022\ndevote greater resources to the research and development of their products and services.\nSome of our principal competitors offer their products or services at a lower price, which has resulted in pricing pressures. Similarly, some competitors offer different billing terms, which has resulted in pressures on our billing terms. If we are unable to maintain our pricing levels and our billing terms, our operating results would be negatively impacted. In addition, pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales, reduced margins, losses or the failure of our solution to achieve or maintain widespread market acceptance, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nWe compete with firms that provide HCM solutions by various means. Many providers continue to deliver legacy enterprise software, but as demand for greater flexibility and access to information grows, we believe there will be increased competition in the delivery of HCM cloud-based solutions by other SaaS providers. Our competitors offer HCM solutions that overlap with one, several or all categories of applications offered by our solution. Our talent acquisition and talent management applications compete primarily with Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc., Oracle Corporation, SAP AG and Workday, Inc. Our payroll applications, including payroll processing, compete primarily with ADP, Ceridian Corporation, Concur Technologies, Inc., Intuit, Inc., Paychex, Inc., Paylocity Holding Corporation and The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. Our HR management applications compete primarily with ADP, Ceridian Corporation, Oracle Corporation, Paychex, Inc., SAP AG, and Workday, Inc. Our time and labor management applications compete primarily with ADP, Ceridian Corporation, Paylocity Holding Corporation and The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. All of our larger competitors compete with us across multiple application categories. In addition, our HCM solution continues to face competition from in-house payroll and HR systems and departments as well as HR systems and software sold by third-party vendors.\nCompetition in the HCM solutions market is primarily based on service responsiveness, application quality and reputation, breadth of service and product offering and price. Many of our competitors are able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products and services. In addition, many of our competitors have established marketing relationships, access to larger client bases and major distribution agreements with consultants, software vendors and distributors. In addition, some competitors may offer software that addresses one or a limited number of HCM functions at a lower price point or with greater depth than our solution. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or client requirements. Further, some potential clients, particularly large enterprises, may elect to develop their own internal solutions. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business, operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe have historically derived a majority of our revenues from payroll processing and our efforts to increase the use of our other HCM applications may not be successful and may reduce our revenue growth rate.\nTo date we have derived a majority of our revenues from payroll processing. Compared to payroll processing, our participation in other HCM applications markets is relatively new, and it is uncertain whether our revenue from other HCM applications will continue to grow. The relatively limited extent to which our other HCM applications have been adopted by our clients, and the uncertainty regarding the adoption of any new applications beyond our existing applications, may make it difficult to evaluate our business because the potential market for such applications remains uncertain. Our HCM solution may not achieve and sustain the high level of market acceptance that is critical for the success of our business. The failure to increase the use of our HCM applications and any new applications developed by us may reduce our revenue growth rate, which could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nIf our security measures are breached, or unauthorized access to data of our clients or their employees is otherwise obtained, our solution may not be perceived as being secure, clients may reduce the use of or stop using our solution and we may incur significant liabilities.\nOur solution involves the collection, storage and transmission of clients\u2019 and their employees\u2019 confidential and proprietary information, including personal or identifying information, as well as financial and payroll data.\nUnauthorized access or security breaches could result in the loss of information, litigation, indemnity obligations and other liability. While we have security measures in place to protect client and employee information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, if these measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise and someone obtains unauthorized access to our clients\u2019 data, our reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently, we may not be able to anticipate these techniques and implement adequate preventative or protective measures. Cyber liability insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, our cyber liability insurance policy may not cover all claims made against us, and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management\u2019s attention.\nAny actual or perceived breach of our security could damage our reputation, cause existing clients to discontinue the use of our solution, prevent us from attracting new clients, or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other actions or liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nIf the SaaS market develops more slowly than we expect or declines, our growth may slow or stall, and our business could be adversely affected.\nThe SaaS market is not as mature as the market for on-premise enterprise software, and it is uncertain whether SaaS will achieve and sustain high levels of demand and market acceptance. Our success will depend not only on strong demand for HCM services in general, but also to a substantial extent on the widespread adoption of SaaS. Many companies have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional enterprise software into their businesses, and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to migrate to SaaS. It is difficult to predict client adoption rates and demand for our solution, the future growth rate and size of the SaaS market or the entry of competitive products. The expansion of the SaaS market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value associated with SaaS, as well as the ability of SaaS providers to address security and privacy concerns. If other SaaS providers experience security incidents, loss of client data, disruptions in delivery or other problems, the market for SaaS applications as a whole, including our solution, may be negatively affected. If SaaS does not achieve widespread adoption, or there is a reduction in demand for SaaS caused by a lack of client acceptance, technological challenges, weakening economic conditions, security or privacy concerns, competing technologies and products, decreases in corporate spending or otherwise, our growth may slow or stall, and our business could be adversely affected.\nAny interruption or failure of our data centers could impair our ability to effectively provide our solution and adversely affect our business.\nWe serve all of our clients from our two data centers located in Oklahoma and Texas. These locations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from severe weather, tornados, terrorist attacks, earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses or cyber-attacks. They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and other misconduct. Our solution depends on the continuing operation of our data centers and any damage to or failure of our data centers could result in interruptions in our services. Any interruption in our service could damage our reputation, cause our clients to terminate their use of our solution and prevent us from gaining new or additional business from current clients, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nAny significant disruption in our SaaS network infrastructure could harm our reputation and expose us to significant costs.\nOur SaaS network infrastructure is a critical part of our business operations. Our clients access our solution through standard web browsers, smart phones, tablets and other web-enabled devises, and depend on us for fast\nand reliable access to our solution. In the future, we may experience disruptions in our computing and communications infrastructure. Factors that may cause such disruptions include:\n\u2022\nhuman error;\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches;\n\u2022\ntelecommunications failures or outages from third-party providers;\n\u2022\ncomputer viruses or cyber-attacks;\n\u2022\nacts of terrorism, sabotage or other intentional acts of vandalism;\n\u2022\nunforeseen interruption or damages;\n\u2022\ntornados, fires, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters; and\n\u2022\npower loss.\nIf our SaaS network infrastructure or our clients\u2019 ability to access to our solution is interrupted, client and employee data from recent transactions may be permanently lost and we could be exposed to significant claims by clients, particularly if the access interruption is associated with problems in the timely delivery of funds due to employees. Any significant instances of system downtime could negatively affect our reputation and ability to retain clients and sell our solution, which would adversely impact our revenues.\nWe have also experienced significant growth in the number of clients, transactions and client and employee data that our network infrastructure supports. We seek to maintain sufficient excess capacity in our network infrastructure to meet the needs of all of our clients and their employees and to facilitate the rapid provision of new client deployments and the expansion of existing client deployments. Any changes in the service levels at our data centers or any errors, defects, disruptions or other performance problems with our network infrastructure could adversely affect our reputation and may result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our solution. Any interruptions in the availability of our solution might reduce our revenues, cause us to issue refunds to clients or adversely affect our retention of existing clients.\nIf our solution fails to perform properly, our reputation could be adversely affected and our market share could decline.\nOur solution is inherently complex and may in the future contain, or develop, undetected defects or errors. Any defects in our applications could adversely affect our reputation, impair our ability to sell our applications in the future and result in significant costs to us. The costs incurred in correcting any application defects may be substantial and could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Any defects in functionality or that cause interruptions in the availability of our applications could result in:\n\u2022\nloss or delayed market acceptance and sales of our applications;\n\u2022\ntermination of service agreements or loss of clients;\n\u2022\ncredits or refunds to clients;\n\u2022\nbreach of contract, breach of warranty or indemnification claims against us, which may result in litigation;\n\u2022\ndiversion of development and service resources; and\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation.\nBecause of the large amount of data that we collect and manage, it is possible that hardware failures or errors in our systems could result in data loss or corruption, or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our clients regard as significant. Furthermore, the availability or\nperformance of our solution could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the failure of our network system or solution or security breaches. We may be liable to our clients for damages they may incur resulting from certain of these events. In addition to potential liability, if we experience interruptions in the availability of our solution, our reputation could be adversely affected and we could lose clients.\nOur clients might assert claims against us in the future alleging that they suffered damages due to a defect, error, or other failure of our solution. Our errors and omissions insurance may be inadequate or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, our policy may not cover all claims made against us, and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management\u2019s attention.\nIf we do not effectively expand and train our sales force and our support teams, we may be unable to add new clients and retain existing clients.\nWe need to continue to expand our sales force and support team members in order to grow our client base and increase our revenues. Identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them in the use of our applications requires significant time, expense and attention and it can take a substantial amount of time before our sales representatives and support team members are fully-trained and productive. We may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we currently, or intend in the future to do business, and our recent hires and planned hires may not achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time or become as productive as we expect. If our expansion efforts are unsuccessful or do not generate a corresponding increase in revenues, our business, operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf we are not able to develop enhancements and new applications, keep pace with technological developments or respond to future disruptive technologies, we might not remain competitive and our business could be adversely affected.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to adapt and innovate. To attract new clients and increase revenues from existing clients, we need to enhance, add new features to and improve our existing applications and introduce new applications. The success of any enhancements or new features and applications depends on several factors, including timely completion, introduction and market acceptance. We may expend significant time and resources developing and pursuing sales of a particular application that may not result in revenues in the anticipated time frame or at all, or may not result in revenue growth sufficient to offset increased expenses. If we are unable to successfully develop enhancements, new features or new applications to meet client needs, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, because our applications are designed to operate on a variety of network, hardware and software platforms using Internet tools and protocols, we will need to continuously modify and enhance our applications to keep pace with changes in Internet-related hardware, software, communication, browser and database technologies. If we are unable to respond in a timely and cost-effective manner to these rapid technological developments, our current and future applications may become less marketable and less competitive or even obsolete.\nOur success is also subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies. If new technologies emerge that are able to deliver HCM solutions at lower prices, more efficiently or more conveniently, such technologies could adversely impact our ability to compete.\nThe market for our solution among large companies may be limited if these companies demand customized features and functions that we do not offer.\nProspective clients, especially larger companies, may require customized features and functions unique to their business processes that we do not offer. In order to ensure we meet these requirements, we may devote a significant amount of support and services resources to larger prospective clients, increasing the cost and time\nrequired to complete sales with no guarantee that these clients will continue to use our solution. Further, we may not be successful in implementing any customized features or functions. If prospective clients require customized features or functions that we do not offer, or that would be difficult for them to deploy themselves, then the market for our solution will be more limited and our business could be adversely affected.\nOur business and operations are experiencing rapid growth and organizational change. If we fail to manage such growth and change effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service or adequately address competitive challenges.\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, rapid growth in our headcount and operations, which has placed, and may continue to place, significant demands on our management, operational and financial resources. For example, our headcount has grown from 523 employees as of December 31, 2011 to 1,021 employees as of December 31, 2014 and we have expanded from 18 offices as of December 31, 2011 to 29 offices as of December 31, 2014. We have also experienced significant growth in the number of clients, transactions and client and employee data that our infrastructure supports. Finally, our organizational structure and recording systems and procedures are becoming more complex as we improve our operational, financial and management controls. Our success will depend in part on our ability to manage this growth and organizational change effectively. To manage the expected growth of our headcount and operations, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls and our reporting systems and procedures. Our ability to add additional offices may be constrained by the willingness and availability of qualified personnel to help staff and manage any new offices. The failure to effectively manage growth could result in difficulties or delays in obtaining clients, selling additional applications to our clients, declines in quality or client satisfaction of our applications, increases in costs, and difficulties in introducing new applications or other operational difficulties, any of which could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract clients or sell additional applications to our existing clients.\nOur business, operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected if our clients are not satisfied with our deployment or technical support services.\nOur business depends on our ability to satisfy our clients, both with respect to our applications and the technical support provided to help clients use the applications that address the needs of their businesses. We use our in-house deployment personnel to implement and configure our solution and provide support to our clients. If a client is not satisfied with the quality of our solution or the applications delivered or the support provided, we could be required to incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of our solution might be negatively affected, and the client\u2019s dissatisfaction with our deployment service could damage our ability to sell additional applications to that client. In addition, our sales process is highly dependent on the reputation of our solution and applications and on positive recommendations from our existing clients. Any failure to maintain high-quality technical support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality technical support, could adversely affect our reputation, our ability to sell our applications to existing and prospective clients, and our business, operating results or financial condition.\nIf we fail to retain key employees and recruit qualified technical and sales personnel, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that our success depends on the continued services of our senior management and other key employees, including Chad Richison, Craig E. Boelte, Jeffrey D. York and William X. Kerber III. In addition, because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new applications, we are heavily dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified software developers and IT personnel with the requisite education, background and industry experience. To continue to execute our growth strategy, we must also attract and retain qualified sales, marketing and operational personnel capable of supporting a larger and more diverse client base. The loss of the services of a significant number of our developers or sales professionals could be disruptive to our development efforts or business relationships. In addition, if any of our key employees joins a competitor or decides to otherwise compete with us, we may experience a material disruption of our\noperations and development plans, which may cause us to lose clients or increase operating expenses or divert management\u2019s attention to recruit replacements for the departed key employees.\nOur financial results may fluctuate due to many factors, some of which may be beyond our control.\nOur results of operations, including the levels of our revenues, costs of revenues, administrative expenses, operating income, cash flow and deferred revenue, may vary significantly in the future and the results of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. Fluctuation in our financial results may negatively impact the value of our common stock. Factors that may cause our financial results to fluctuate from period to period include, without limitation:\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new clients or sell additional applications to our existing clients;\n\u2022\nthe number of new clients and their employees, as compared to the number of existing clients and their employees in a particular period;\n\u2022\nthe mix of clients between small, mid-sized and large organizations;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we retain existing clients and the expansion or contraction of our relationship with them;\n\u2022\nthe mix of applications sold during a period;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nseasonal factors affecting payroll processing, demand for our applications or potential clients\u2019 purchasing decisions;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses, including those related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of new applications introduced by us and the timing of expenses related to the development of new applications and technologies;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of current and new competitive products and services by our competitors;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions affecting our clients, including their ability to outsource HCM solutions and hire employees;\n\u2022\nother changes in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors or clients;\n\u2022\nour ability to manage our existing business and future growth, including expenses related to our data centers and the expansion of such data centers and the addition of new offices;\n\u2022\nthe effects and expenses of acquisition of third-party technologies or businesses and any potential future charges for impairment of goodwill resulting from those acquisitions;\n\u2022\nnetwork outages or security breaches; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry and market conditions.\nCertain of our operating results and financial metrics are difficult to predict as a result of seasonality.\nWe have historically experienced seasonality in our revenues because a significant portion of our recurring revenues relate to the annual processing of payroll forms such as Form W-2 and Form 1099. Because these forms are typically processed in the first quarter of the year, first quarter revenues are generally higher than subsequent quarters. We expect this seasonality to continue in the future, which may cause fluctuations in certain of our operating results and financial metrics, and thus make such results and metrics difficult to predict.\nIf we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights, our competitive advantage could be impaired and we may lose valuable assets, generate reduced revenue or incur costly litigation to protect our rights.\nOur success is dependent in part upon our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate. We will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Despite our precautions, it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our applications and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products or services that compete with ours.\nWe may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property. We have been involved in litigation in the past and litigation may be necessary in the future to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets. Such litigation could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. We may not be able to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights or control access to, and the distribution of, our solution and proprietary information.\nWe may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.\nConsiderable intellectual property development activity exists in our industry, and we expect that software developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of applications and competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps. Our competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property in technology areas relating to our solution or applications. In addition, we may increasingly be subject to trademark infringement claims as our presence grows in the marketplace. From time to time, third parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing upon such rights. A claim of infringement may also be made relating to technology that we acquire or license from third parties. However, we may be unaware of the intellectual property rights of others that may cover, or may be alleged to cover, some or all of our solution, applications or brands.\nFor example, on September 23, 2014, in anticipation of an alleged trademark infringement claim, we filed a complaint against National Financial Partners Corp. in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma (Civil Action No. 5:14-cv-01029-R) seeking a declaratory judgment that we have not engaged in any trademark infringement or unfair competition in connection with the use of our logo. On September 23, 2014, National Financial Partners Corp. filed a complaint against us in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (Civil Action No. 1:14-cv-07424). The complaint alleges trademark infringement, unfair competition, deceptive trade practices, consumer fraud and deceptive business practices related to the adoption and use of our logo and seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting us from continued infringement as well as money damages, including an accounting for sales and profits, attorneys\u2019 fees and disgorgement of profits. On October 16, 2014, National Financial Partners Corp. filed a motion to dismiss the action pending in the Western District of Oklahoma. On October 20, 2014, we filed a motion to transfer the action from the Northern District of Illinois to the Western District of Oklahoma, and a memorandum in support of the motion to transfer, in the Northern District of Illinois. On December 12, 2014, the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma granted National Financial Partners Corp.\u2019s motion to dismiss. National Financial Partners Corp. has moved for an order preliminarily enjoining us from using our logo in the Northern District of Illinois. On January 5, 2015, we filed an answer, affirmative defenses and counterclaim in the Northern District of Illinois denying the material allegations in National Financial Corp.\u2019s complaint and seeking a declaratory judgment that we have not engaged in any trademark infringement with respect to the use of our logo. On February 15, 2015, the Northern District of Illinois denied our motion to transfer the venue and scheduled the lawsuit for trial in the Northern District of Illinois in February 2016. The Northern District of Illinois has not yet\nruled on National Financial Partners Corp.\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. The Northern District of Illinois will set a briefing schedule on the motion filed by NFP asking the Court to enter a preliminary injunction prohibiting our use of our logo pending the outcome of the action. NFP\u2019s motion for a preliminary injuction will be heard in the Western District of Oklahoma. We intend to vigorously defend this litigation. In the event that a court ultimately determines that we have infringed any of the asserted trademarks or grants National Financial Partners Corp.\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction, we may be subject to damages, which may include treble damages, be enjoined from using our current logo while the parties are litigating the merits of the claims or be required to modify our logo and/or undergo a rebranding of our solution and applications. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the outcome of the litigation or determine the extent of any potential liability or damages.\nThe outcome of the foregoing litigation matter is inherently unpredictable, and therefore as a result of this litigation matter or any future claim of infringement, a claim could (i) cause us to enter into an unfavorable royalty or license agreement, pay ongoing royalties or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms, (ii) require us to discontinue the sale of our solution or applications, (iii) require us to indemnify our clients or third-party service providers or (iv) require us to expend additional development resources to redesign our solution or applications. Any of these outcomes could harm our business. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business and operations.\nWe employ third-party licensed software for use in our applications and the inability to maintain these licenses or errors in the software we license could result in increased costs or reduced service levels, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur applications incorporate certain third-party software obtained under licenses from other companies. We anticipate that we will continue to rely on such third-party software and development tools from third parties in the future. Although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the third-party software we currently license, this may not always be the case, or it may be difficult or costly to replace. In addition, integration of the software used in our applications with new third-party software may require significant work and substantial investment of our time and resources. Also, to the extent that our applications depend upon the successful operation of third-party software in conjunction with our software, any undetected errors or defects in this third-party software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our applications, delay new application introductions, result in a failure of our applications and harm our reputation.\nThe use of open source software in our applications may expose us to additional risks and harm our intellectual property rights.\nSome of our applications use software covered by open source licenses. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate such software into their products or applications. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition or require us to devote additional development resources to change our applications. In addition, if we were to combine our applications with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our applications. If we inappropriately use open source software, we may be required to redesign our applications, discontinue the sale of our applications or take other remedial actions.\nWe may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development activities for several years, if at all.\nDeveloping SaaS-based applications is expensive and the investment in the development of these applications often involves a long return on investment cycle. We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development activities. Accelerated application introductions and short\nsoftware life cycles require increased levels of research and development expenditures that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by increased revenues. We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development activities to maintain our competitive position. We may not receive significant revenues from these investments however, for several years, if at all.\nThe failure to develop our brand cost-effectively could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving the widespread acceptance of our solution and is an important element in attracting new clients and retaining existing clients. Successful promotion of our brand depends largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful applications at competitive prices. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenues, and even if they do, any increased revenues may not offset the expenses incurred in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract enough new clients or retain our existing clients to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe might require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe have funded our operations since inception through cash flows generated from operations, cash from the sale of debt and equity securities and borrowings under consolidated loans. In the future, we may require additional capital to support our growth and respond to operational challenges, including the need to develop new features and applications or enhance our existing applications, improve our infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our growth and respond to challenges could be significantly limited.\nOur outstanding indebtedness is subject to certain operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities and may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had a term note under the 2021 Consolidated Loan with an outstanding principal amount of $27.0 million due to Kirkpatrick Bank that matures on May 30, 2021 (the \u201c2021 Consolidated Loan\u201d). The 2021 Consolidated Loan is secured by a mortgage covering our headquarters buildings and certain personal property relating to our headquarters buildings. Pursuant to the terms of the 2021 Consolidated Loan, we may not, subject to certain exceptions, until amounts under the 2021 Consolidated Loan are repaid:\n\u2022\ncreate any mortgages or liens;\n\u2022\nmake any loans, advances or extensions of credit with any affiliate or enter into any other transaction with any affiliate;\n\u2022\nlease any mortgaged property;\n\u2022\nmake any distributions as long as an event of default exists;\n\u2022\nmake any material change in methods of accounting;\n\u2022\nenter into any sale and leaseback arrangement;\n\u2022\namend, modify, restate, cancel or terminate our organizational documents;\n\u2022\nsell, transfer or convey any mortgaged property;\n\u2022\nor incur funded outside debt.\nIn addition, under the 2021 Consolidated Loan we are required to maintain a debt coverage ratio of EBITDA to indebtedness (defined as current maturities of long-term debt, interest expense and distributions) of greater than 1.5 to 1.0. The operating and financial covenants in the 2021 Consolidated Loan, as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into, may restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies. We may also be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows to pay principal and interest on our debt, which would reduce the amount of money we have for operations, working capital, expansion, or other general corporate purposes.\nOur ability to meet our expenses and debt obligations and comply with the operating and financial covenants may be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to control many of these factors and comply with these covenants. A breach of any of the covenants under the 2021 Consolidated Loan could result in an event of default, which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under the 2021 Consolidated Loan to become immediately due and payable.\nWe may acquire other businesses, applications or technologies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nIn the future, we may seek to acquire or invest in businesses, applications or technologies that we believe complement or expand our applications, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are ultimately consummated.\nWe do not have any experience in acquiring other businesses. If we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel, operations and technologies successfully or to effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe inability to integrate or benefit from acquired applications or services in a profitable manner;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of acquisition-related costs;\n\u2022\ndifficulty integrating the accounting systems, operations and personnel of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ndifficulty and additional expenses associated with supporting legacy products and hosting infrastructure of the acquired business;\n\u2022\ndifficulty converting the clients of the acquired business onto our solution, including disparities in the revenues, licensing, support or services of the acquired company;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nharm to our existing relationships with clients as a result of the acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees;\n\u2022\nthe use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and\n\u2022\nthe use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of any companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could harm our results of operations. Acquisitions could also result in issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which would result in dilution to our stockholders.\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our relationships with third parties.\nWe rely on third-party financial and accounting processing systems, as well as various financial institutions, to perform financial services in connection with our applications, such as providing automated clearing house (\u201cACH\u201d), and wire transfers as part of our payroll and expense reimbursement services and to provide technology and content support, manufacture time clocks and process background checks. We anticipate that we will continue to depend on various third-party relationships in order to grow our business, provide technology and content support, manufacture time clocks and process background checks. Identifying, negotiating and documenting relationships with these third parties and integrating third-party content and technology requires significant time and resources. Our agreements with third parties typically are non-exclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors. In addition, these third parties may not perform as expected under our agreements, and we may have disagreements or disputes with such third parties, which could negatively affect our brand and reputation. A global economic slowdown could also adversely affect the businesses of our third party providers, particularly those financial institutions that process transactions through the ACH network, and it is possible that they may not be able to devote the resources we expect to our relationship.\nIf we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with these third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenues could be impaired and our business, operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected. Even if we are successful, these relationships may not result in improved operating results.\nAdverse economic conditions could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nOur business depends on the overall demand for HCM applications and on the economic health of our current and prospective clients. If economic conditions in the United States remain uncertain or deteriorate, clients may cease their operations or delay or reduce their HCM spending or the number of their employees. This could result in reductions in sales of our applications, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. In addition, HCM spending levels may not increase following any recovery.\nIf our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nWe are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually or earlier if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. As of December 31, 2014, we had recorded a total of $51.9 million of goodwill and $5.1 million of other intangible assets. An adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of our critical assumptions or estimates made in connection with the impairment testing of goodwill or intangible assets, could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge to our goodwill or other intangible assets. Any such material charges may have a negative impact our operating results.\nWe typically pay employees and may pay taxing authorities amounts due for a payroll period before a client\u2019s electronic funds transfers are finally settled to our account. If client payments are rejected by banking institutions or otherwise fail to clear into our accounts, we may require additional sources of short-term liquidity and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur payroll processing application moves significant funds from the account of a client to employees and relevant taxing authorities. For larger funding amounts, we require clients to transfer the funds to us via fed wire. For smaller funding amounts, we debit a client\u2019s account prior to any disbursement on its behalf, and due to ACH banking regulations, funds previously credited could be reversed under certain circumstances and time frames after our payment of amounts due to employees and taxing and other regulatory authorities. There is therefore a risk that the employer\u2019s funds will be insufficient to cover the amounts we have already paid on its behalf. While such shortage and accompanying financial exposure has only occurred in very limited circumstances in the past, should clients default on their payment obligations in the future, we might be required to advance substantial funds to cover such obligations. In such an event, we may be required to seek additional sources of short-term liquidity, which may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and our operating results and our liquidity could be adversely affected and our banking relationships could be harmed.\nBecause our long term success depends, in part, on our ability to expand the sales of our solution to clients located outside of the United States, our business will be subject to risks associated with international operations.\nAn element of our growth strategy is to expand our operations and client base. To date, we have not engaged in any operations outside of the United States. If we decide to expand our operations into international markets, it will require significant resources and management attention and will subject us to regulatory, economic and political risks that are different from those in the United States. Because of our lack of experience with international operations, we cannot assure you that our international expansion efforts will be successful.\nRisks Related to Legislation or Regulation\nPrivacy concerns and laws or other domestic regulations may reduce the effectiveness of our applications.\nOur applications require the storage and transmission of the proprietary and confidential information of our clients and their employees, including personal or identifying information, as well as their financial and payroll data. Our applications are subject to varying complex government laws and regulations on the federal, state and local levels, including those governing personal privacy, which has become a significant issue in the United States. The regulatory framework for privacy issues is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Many federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. In the United States, these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, federal and state labor and employment laws and state data breach notification laws.\nIn addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards. Because the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws are still uncertain, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our solution. Any failure to comply with government regulations that apply to our applications, including privacy and data protection laws, could subject us to liability. In addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits and other claims, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our solution, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. Any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations and policies, could result in additional cost\nand liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nFurthermore, privacy concerns may cause our clients\u2019 employees to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our clients or their employees to use our applications effectively. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our applications in certain industries. All of these legislative and regulatory initiatives may adversely affect the ability of our clients to process, handle, store, use and transmit demographic and personal information from their employees, which could reduce demand for our applications.\nChanges in laws and regulations related to the Internet or changes in the Internet infrastructure itself may diminish the demand for our applications, and could have a negative impact on our business.\nThe future success of our business depends upon the continued use of the Internet as a primary medium for commerce, communication and business. Federal, state and foreign government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting the use of the Internet as a commercial medium. Changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our applications in order to comply with these changes. In addition, government agencies or private organizations may impose taxes, fees or other charges for accessing the Internet or commerce conducted via the Internet. These laws or charges could limit the growth of Internet-related commerce or communications generally, or result in reductions in the demand for Internet-based applications such as ours.\nIn addition, the use of the Internet as a means of conducting business could be adversely affected due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of Internet activity, security, reliability, cost, ease of use, accessibility, and quality of service. The performance of the Internet has been adversely affected by \u201cviruses,\u201d \u201cworms\u201d and similar malicious programs and the Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure. If the use of the Internet is adversely affected by these issues, demand for our applications could suffer.\nIf we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected.\nWe will be required pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015 and in each year thereafter. Our auditors will also need to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the future to the extent we are no longer an emerging growth company, as defined by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and are not a smaller reporting company.\nIf we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. We are in the process of designing and implementing internal control over financial reporting to comply with this obligation, which process will be time consuming, costly and complicated. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports we could become subject to investigations by the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d), the SEC, or other regulatory authorities and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies.\nAs a new public company, we have incurred since our initial public offering and expect to continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting and corporate governance requirements. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and are required to comply with the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and the NYSE, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting and changes in corporate governance practices.\nWe expect that complying with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. In particular, we have incurred and expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which will increase to the extent we are no longer an emerging growth company, as defined by the JOBS Act, and are not a smaller reporting company. We cannot fully predict or estimate the amount or timing of future costs associated with being a public company, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe increased costs associated with operating as a public company may decrease our net income or result in a net loss and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our solution. Additionally, if these requirements divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, they could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nAs a public company, we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage for director and officer liability insurance or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers.\nWe are an emerging growth company and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. Pursuant to Section 102 of the JOBS Act, we have reduced executive compensation disclosure and have omitted a Compensation Discussion and Analysis from this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of certain other exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation, the frequency of the nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved and the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Investors may find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the end of the fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30th, (ii) the end of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more during such fiscal year, (iii) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period and (iv) December 31, 2019.\nAdverse tax laws or regulations could be enacted or existing laws could be applied to us or our clients, which could increase the costs of our solution and applications and could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nThe application of federal, state and local tax laws to services provided electronically is evolving. New income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time (possibly with retroactive effect), and could be applied solely or disproportionately to services and applications provided over the Internet. These enactments could adversely affect our sales activity, due to the inherent cost increase the taxes would represent and ultimately could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nIn addition, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us (possibly with retroactive effect), which could require us or our clients to pay additional tax amounts, as well as require us or our clients to pay fines or penalties and interest for past amounts. If we are unsuccessful in collecting such taxes from our clients, we could be held liable for such costs, thereby adversely affecting our business, operating results or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\nFrom time to time, we have released, and may continue to release, guidance in our earnings conference calls, earnings releases, or otherwise, regarding our future performance that represents our estimates as of the date of release. This guidance, which includes forward-looking statements, has been and will be based on projections prepared by our management. These projections are not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our registered public accountants nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the projections. Accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect to the projections.\nProjections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic, and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. The principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such third parties.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results may vary from our guidance and the variations may be material. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock.\nAny failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could result in the actual operating results being different from our guidance, and the differences may be adverse and material.\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the current market price.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile for the foreseeable future. If an active trading market for our common stock is not sustained, you may have difficulty selling any shares of our common stock that you purchased, and the value of such shares may be materially impaired. The\nmarket price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nour operating performance and the performance of other similar companies;\n\u2022\nthe overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new applications or enhancements, acquisitions, applications, services, strategic alliances, commercial relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in our services due to hardware, software or network problems;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\npublication of unfavorable research reports about us or our industry or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022\ntrading activity by a limited number of stockholders who together beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock;\n\u2022\nthe size of our public float;\n\u2022\nthe economy as a whole, market conditions in our industry and the industries of our clients; and\n\u2022\neconomic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance.\nIn addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have filed securities class actions following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nSubstantial blocks of our total outstanding shares may be sold into the market when the \u201clock-up\u201d period for our follow-on offering ends on April 14, 2015. If there are substantial sales of shares of our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe price of our common stock could decline if there are substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders. Shares held by directors, executive officers and certain other affiliates will be eligible to be resold in the public market once the lock-up period for the follow-on offering ends on April 14, 2015, subject to volume limitations under Rule 144 under the Securities Act and restrictions under the terms of various restricted stock award agreements.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If no or few securities or industry analysts cover our company, the trading price for our common stock would be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes incorrect or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which could cause our common stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur principal stockholders hold a controlling interest in our common stock and may make business decisions with which you disagree and which may adversely affect the value of an investment in the Company.\nAs of January 30, 2015, the parties to an Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement (the \u201cStockholders Agreement\u201d), which include Chad Richison, Shannon Rowe, William X. Kerber, III, Jeffrey D. York, Robert J. Levenson and the Estate of Richard Aiello and certain of their affiliates or related entities, and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe X, L.P. (\u201cWCAS X\u201d), WCAS Capital Partners IV, L.P. (\u201cWCAS Capital IV\u201d), and WCAS Management Corporation (collectively, the \u201cStockholders Agreement Parties\u201d), beneficially owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, 40,226,418 shares of common stock in the aggregate equal to approximately 68.9% of our outstanding shares. As a result of this ownership and the provisions of the Stockholders Agreement WCAS X, WCAS Capital IV and WCAS Management Corporation and certain of their affiliated funds (collectively, \u201cWCAS Funds\u201d or \u201cWelsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe\u201d) will have the ability to control matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the approval of any business combination. These actions may be taken even if they are opposed by other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares, which could prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares.\nSome of these persons or entities may have interests different than yours. For example, because many of these stockholders purchased their shares at prices substantially below the current market price of our common stock and have held their shares for a longer period, they may be more interested in selling the Company to an acquirer than other investors or may want us to pursue strategies that deviate from the interests of other stockholders.\nWe are deemed a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and, as a result, will qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nThe Stockholders Agreement Parties currently own more than a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock. So long as such persons collectively own a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock, we will be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of corporate governance standards of the NYSE. Under those standards, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by another company or group is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and need not comply with certain requirements, including (1) the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors, (2) the requirement that there be a nominating and corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities, (3) the requirement that there be a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities and (4) the requirement of an annual performance evaluation of the nominating/corporate governance and compensation committees. We may rely on any of these exemptions for so long as we are a \u201ccontrolled company.\u201d As a result, we will not have a majority of independent directors on our board of directors, and our compensation committee does not consist entirely of independent directors. If we are no longer eligible to rely on the controlled company exception, we intend to comply with all applicable corporate governance requirements, but we will be able to rely on phase-in periods for certain of these requirements in accordance with the NYSE\u2019s rules. Accordingly, our stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all NYSE corporate governance requirements.\nThe issuance of additional stock in connection with acquisitions, our stock incentive plans, warrants or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to one hundred million shares of common stock and up to ten million shares of preferred stock with such rights and preferences as may be determined by our board of directors. Subject to compliance with applicable rules and regulations, we may issue all of these shares that are not already outstanding without any action or approval by our stockholders. We intend to continue to\nevaluate strategic acquisitions in the future. We may pay for such acquisitions, partly or in full, through the issuance of additional equity securities.\nAny issuance of shares in connection with an acquisition, the exercise of stock options or warrants, the award of shares of restricted stock or otherwise would dilute the percentage ownership held by our existing stockholders.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nAny provision of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d), the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change.", "PERMNO": 14579, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "PAYC"}
