{"cik": "918386", "company": "QLOGIC CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-05-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results of operations to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report or otherwise publicly disclosed by the Company.\nOur operating results may fluctuate in future periods, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe have experienced, are currently experiencing, and expect to experience in future periods, fluctuations in sales and operating results from quarter to quarter. For example, the market for our Fibre Channel products is mature and has declined during recent periods. The lack of growth in the Fibre Channel market may be the result of a shift in the information technology (IT) data center deployment model, as more enterprise workloads are moving to cloud data centers, which primarily use Ethernet solutions as their connectivity protocol. To the extent the Fibre Channel market declines, our quarterly operating results would be negatively impacted.\nWe have made, and continue to make, significant investments in the development and sale of our Ethernet products. The market for our Ethernet products is highly competitive. Some of our competitors are large, well-established companies that have significant competitive advantages over us. To the extent that we are unable to effectively compete in this market, our quarterly operating results would be negatively impacted.\nA significant portion of our net revenues in each fiscal quarter results from orders booked in that quarter. Orders placed by major customers are typically based on their forecasted sales and inventory levels for our products. Accordingly, it is extremely difficult for us to forecast future sales levels and historical information may not be indicative of future trends. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current gross margins or profitability in the future.\nFluctuations in our quarterly operating results may also be the result of:\n\u2022\nthe timing, size and mix of orders from customers;\n\u2022\ngain or loss of significant customers or market share;\n\u2022\nserver refresh cycles, including the timing, rate of market acceptance and growth in volume shipments of products based on the new technology;\n\u2022\nindustry consolidation among our competitors, our customers or our suppliers;\n\u2022\ncustomer inventory levels of our products;\n\u2022\nsales discounts and customer incentives;\n\u2022\nthe availability and sale of new products;\n\u2022\nchanges in our average selling prices;\n\u2022\nvariations in manufacturing capacities, efficiencies and costs;\n\u2022\nthe availability and cost of components, including application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs);\n\u2022\nvariations in product development costs, especially related to advanced technologies;\n\u2022\nvariations in operating expenses;\n\u2022\nimpairments of long-lived assets, including goodwill, purchased intangible assets, and property and equipment;\n\u2022\nchanges in effective income tax rates, including those resulting from changes in tax laws;\n\u2022\nour ability to timely produce products that comply with new environmental restrictions or related requirements of our original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and original design manufacturer (ODM) customers;\n\u2022\nactual events, circumstances, outcomes and amounts differing from judgments, assumptions and estimates used in determining the value of certain assets (including the amounts of related valuation allowances), liabilities and other items reflected in our consolidated financial statements;\n\u2022\nthe timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferrals;\n\u2022\ngains or losses related to our marketable securities; or\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting rules or our accounting policies.\nIn addition, our quarterly results of operations are influenced by competitive factors, including the pricing and availability of our products and our competitors\u2019 products. Furthermore, communications regarding new products and technologies could cause our customers to defer or cancel purchases of our products. Order deferrals by our customers, delays in our introduction of new products, and longer than anticipated design-in cycles for our products have in the past adversely affected our quarterly results of operations. Due to these factors, as well as other unanticipated factors, it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors, and as a result, the price of our common stock could significantly decrease.\nCompetition within the markets for products such as ours is intense and includes various established competitors.\nThe markets for networking connectivity products are highly competitive and characterized by short product life cycles, price erosion, rapidly changing technology, frequent product performance improvements and evolving industry standards. Due to the diversity of products required in storage, data and converged networking, we compete with many companies. In the traditional enterprise storage Fibre Channel adapter and ASIC markets, our primary competitor is Broadcom Limited (formerly known as Avago Technologies Limited), who acquired our former long-time competitor Emulex Corporation (Emulex) in May 2015. In the high-speed Ethernet adapter and ASIC markets, which include converged networking products such as Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) and Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI), we compete primarily with Broadcom Limited, Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. and Intel Corporation (Intel). We may also compete with some of our server and storage systems customers, some of which have the capability to develop products comparable to those we offer.\nSome of our competitors, including Broadcom Limited and Intel, have significantly more engineering, sales and marketing resources than us to dedicate to developing and penetrating markets, offer a much broader portfolio of products to customers, and have cost advantages over us due to their vertical integration and greater scale of operations. Should these companies successfully leverage these competitive advantages, our business could significantly deteriorate and our results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nAs noted above, Broadcom Limited acquired Emulex in May 2015 and, as a result, Broadcom Limited is a competitor in both the Fibre Channel and Ethernet markets. In February 2016, Avago Technologies Limited (now known as Broadcom Limited) acquired Broadcom Corporation, which was our primary supplier of Ethernet ASICs. Broadcom Limited is our primary Fibre Channel ASIC supplier and is now our primary Ethernet ASIC supplier. We have long-term supply contracts in place that we believe safeguard our supply of Fibre Channel and Ethernet ASICs. Should this supplier fail to adhere to the terms of our supply contracts and if the remedies in the contracts fail to adequately protect us, our supply of Fibre Channel and Ethernet ASICs could be at risk or more costly, and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe need to continue to develop products appropriate to our markets to remain competitive as our competitors continue to introduce products with improved features. While we continue to devote significant resources to engineering and development, these efforts may not be successful or competitive products may not be developed and introduced in a timely manner. If we are unable to design, develop or introduce competitive new products on a timely basis, or if our competitors introduce new products that are more successful than ours in the marketplace, our future operating results may be materially and adversely affected.\nOur operating results have been, are being, and may in the future be, adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions.\nCertain countries around the world, including but not limited to China, have experienced and are continuing to experience economic weakness and uncertainty. Political instability in certain regions of the world is significantly contributing to this economic uncertainty. Economic uncertainty is adversely affecting, and in the future may continue to adversely affect, IT spending rates. For example, certain of our large OEM customers are reporting significant weakness in particular markets and geographies. Reductions in IT spending rates have resulted in reduced sales volumes, and could result in lower prices for our products, longer sales cycles, increased inventory provisions and increased production costs, all of which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nAs a result of worldwide economic weakness and uncertainty, it is extremely difficult for us and our customers to forecast future revenue levels based on historical information and trends. To the extent that we do not achieve our anticipated level of revenue, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, we may not be able to sustain or grow our business.\nOur future success largely depends on our key engineering, sales, marketing and executive personnel, including highly skilled ASIC design personnel and software developers. Our Chief Executive Officer resigned in August 2015 and we appointed Jean Hu as Acting Chief Executive Officer and Christine King as Executive Chairman. It is important that we retain key personnel. If we lose the services of key personnel, or do not hire or retain other personnel for key positions, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that the market for key personnel in the industries in which we compete is highly competitive. In particular, we have periodically experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified engineers and other technical personnel and anticipate that competition for such personnel will increase in the future. As a result, we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel with the skills and expertise necessary to develop new products in the future or to manage our business, both in the United States and abroad.\nWe have historically used equity awards and our employee stock purchase program as key components of our total employee compensation program in order to align employees\u2019 interests with the interests of our stockholders, encourage retention of key personnel, and provide competitive compensation packages. However, the guidelines of proxy advisory firms relating to stockholder approval of shares available under equity compensation plans and share usage could make it more difficult for us to obtain such approval and therefore grant stock-based awards to employees in the future, which may result in changes in our stock-based compensation strategy. These and other developments relating to the provision of stock-based compensation to employees could make it more difficult to attract, retain and motivate key personnel.\nWe expect gross margin to vary over time primarily due to product mix.\nOur gross margin is expected to vary over time primarily due to product mix, including the mix of Fibre Channel and Ethernet product sales. Our gross margins may also be adversely affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\ntransitions into new markets, which may have lower gross margins;\n\u2022\nchanges in manufacturing volumes over which fixed costs are absorbed;\n\u2022\nincreased price competition;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new products by us or our competitors, including products with advantages in price, performance or features;\n\u2022\nour inability to reduce manufacturing-related or component costs;\n\u2022\nentry into new markets;\n\u2022\namortization and impairments of purchased intangible assets;\n\u2022\nsales discounts and customer incentives;\n\u2022\nincreases in material, labor or overhead costs;\n\u2022\nexcess inventory and inventory holding charges;\n\u2022\nchanges in distribution channels;\n\u2022\nincreased warranty costs; and\n\u2022\nacquisitions and dispositions of businesses, technologies or product lines.\nA decrease in our gross margin could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially and there can be no assurance that such volatility will not continue. Several factors could impact our stock price, including:\n\u2022\ndifferences between our actual revenues and operating results and the published expectations of public market analysts;\n\u2022\nquarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results;\n\u2022\nintroduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by our competitors or us;\n\u2022\nconditions in the markets in which we operate;\n\u2022\nchanges in market projections by industry forecasters;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates of our earnings or rating upgrades or downgrades of our stock by public market analysts;\n\u2022\noperating results or forecasts of our major customers or competitors;\n\u2022\nrumors or dissemination of false information; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and geopolitical conditions.\nIn addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume volatility in recent years and stock prices of technology companies have been especially volatile. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many public companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.\nOur business is dependent, in large part, on the continued growth of the networking markets that we serve and if these markets do not continue to develop, our business will suffer.\nOur products are used in storage, data and converged networks, and therefore our business is dependent on these markets. Our success in generating revenue in these markets will depend on, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\neducate potential OEM and ODM customers, distributors, resellers, system integrators, storage system providers and end-user organizations about the benefits of our products;\n\u2022\nmaintain and enhance our relationships with OEM and ODM customers, distributors, resellers, system integrators and storage system providers;\n\u2022\npredict and base our products on standards that ultimately become industry standards; and\n\u2022\nachieve and maintain interoperability between our products and other equipment and components from diverse vendors.\nIf we are not successful in any or all of these items, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend on a small number of customers and any decrease in revenues from any one of our major customers could adversely affect our results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.\nA small number of customers account for a substantial portion of our net revenues, and we expect that a small number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future. Our top ten customers accounted for 80%, 81% and 83% of net revenues during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Total revenue from our three largest customers during fiscal 2016, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Dell Inc. (Dell), and Lenovo Group Ltd. (Lenovo), collectively accounted for more than 50% of fiscal 2016 net revenues. Total revenue from our three largest customers during fiscal 2015 and 2014, Hewlett-Packard Company, Dell and International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), collectively accounted for more than 50% of net revenues for such periods. In November 2015, Hewlett-Packard Company separated itself into two new public companies, HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company. In early 2015, Lenovo completed the closing of its acquisition of IBM\u2019s x86 server business.\nA significant portion of the products we sell are incorporated into servers manufactured by our major customers for use in enterprise environments. Certain of our large OEM customers are reporting weakness in this market. If server sales by our major customers continue to be adversely affected by the IT spending environment or server market factors (such as an acceleration in the shift from servers used in enterprise environments to servers used in cloud environments), demand for our products could decrease further, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur customers generally order products through written purchase orders instead of long-term supply contracts and, therefore, are generally not obligated to purchase products from us for any extended period. Customers typically incorporate our products into complex devices and systems, which creates supply chain cross-dependencies. Accordingly, supply chain disruptions affecting components of our customers\u2019 devices and/or systems could negatively impact the demand for our products, even if the supply of our products is not directly affected. Major customers also have significant leverage over us and may attempt to change the sales terms, including pricing, customer incentives and payment terms, or insist that we undertake or fund significant aspects of the design, qualification and testing that our customers have typically been responsible for, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. As our customers are pressured to reduce prices as a result of competitive factors, we may be required to contractually commit to price reductions for our products before we know how, or if, cost reductions can be achieved. If we are unable to achieve these cost reductions, our gross margins could decline and such a decline could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe ongoing consolidation in the technology industry could adversely impact our business. There is the potential for some of our customers to merge with or acquire one or more of our other customers. For example, Dell has announced its intention to acquire EMC Corporation. There is also a possibility that one of our large customers could acquire one of our current competitors. As a result of such transactions, demand for our products could decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur financial condition will be materially harmed if we do not maintain and gain market acceptance of our products.\nThe markets in which we compete involve rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards and continuing improvements in products and services. Examples of these changing technologies include system-on-chip products and both software-defined-networking and software-defined-storage products. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to:\n\u2022\nenhance our current products and develop and introduce, in a timely manner, new products that keep pace with technological developments and industry standards;\n\u2022\ncompete effectively on the basis of price and performance; and\n\u2022\nadequately address OEM, ODM and end-user customer requirements and achieve market acceptance.\nWe believe that to remain competitive, we will need to continue to develop new products and enter new markets, which will require significant investment. Some new markets may require engagement with customers with whom we have limited or no prior experience. Our competitors may be developing alternative technologies, or entering into exclusive strategic alliances with our major customers, either of which may adversely affect the market acceptance of our products, our ability to enter new markets, or our ability to secure customer design wins. Although we continue to explore and develop products based on new technologies, a substantial portion of our revenues is generated today from Fibre Channel technology. If alternative technologies are adopted by the industry, we may not be able to develop products for these technologies in a timely manner. Further, even if alternative technologies do augment Fibre Channel revenues, our products may not be fully developed in time to be accepted by our customers. Even if our new products are developed in time, we may not be able to manufacture them at competitive prices or in sufficient volumes.\nSome of our products are based on FCoE or high-speed Ethernet technologies. FCoE is a converged networking technology that provides a unified storage and data network over Enhanced Ethernet, while preserving the investment by end users in their existing Fibre Channel infrastructure and storage. High-speed Ethernet is a technology for use in enterprise, managed service provider and cloud service provider data centers. The market for high-speed Ethernet products includes well-established participants who have significantly more engineering, sales and marketing resources to dedicate to developing and penetrating the market than we do. An inability to maintain, or build on, our market share in the Fibre Channel, high-speed Ethernet or converged markets, or the failure of these markets to expand, could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nWe are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for certain key components.\nCertain key components used in the manufacture of our products are purchased from single or limited sources. ASICs are purchased from single sources. For example, in connection with our acquisition of certain 10/25/40/50/100Gb Ethernet controller-related assets, we entered into a development and supply agreement which requires us to purchase certain ASICs used in the related products exclusively from Broadcom Corporation. Other key components such as microprocessors, logic chips, power supplies and programmable logic devices are purchased from limited sources. If one of these suppliers experiences an interruption in its ability to supply our needs, or chooses to sever or significantly change its relationship with us, we may be unable to produce certain of our products, which could result in the loss of customers and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nBroadcom Limited, our primary Fibre Channel ASIC supplier, acquired Emulex in May 2015. Emulex had historically been our principal competitor in the Fibre Channel market. In February 2016, Avago Technologies Limited (now known as Broadcom Limited) acquired Broadcom Corporation, which was our primary supplier of Ethernet ASICs. We have long-term supply contracts in place that we believe safeguard our supply of Fibre Channel and Ethernet ASICs. Should our suppliers fail to adhere to the terms of our supply contracts and if the remedies in the contracts fail to adequately protect us, our supply of Fibre Channel and Ethernet ASICs could be at risk or more costly, and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on worldwide third-party subcontractors and contract manufacturers.\nThird-party subcontractors located outside the United States assemble and test certain products for us. To the extent that we rely on third-party subcontractors to perform these functions, we will not be able to directly control product delivery schedules and quality assurance. This lack of control may result in product shortages or quality assurance problems that could delay shipments of products or increase manufacturing, assembly, testing or other costs. If a subcontractor experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties, suffers damage to its facilities, experiences power outages, natural disasters, labor shortages or labor strikes, or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner or on commercially acceptable terms.\nIn addition, the loss of our largest third-party contract manufacturer could significantly impact our ability to produce products for an indefinite period of time. Qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is a lengthy and expensive process. Some customers will not purchase any products, other than a limited number of evaluation units, until they qualify the manufacturing line for the product. If we are required to change a contract manufacturer or if a contract manufacturer moves the production lines for our products to new locations, or otherwise experiences delays, disruptions, capacity constraints, component part shortages or quality control problems in its manufacturing operations, shipment of our products to our customers could be delayed, resulting in loss or postponement of revenues and potential harm to our competitive position and relationships with customers.\nWe may engage in mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and strategic investments and these activities could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price.\nOur future growth may depend in part on our ability to identify and acquire businesses, technologies or product lines. Mergers and acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe failure of markets for the products of acquired businesses, technologies or product lines to develop as expected;\n\u2022\nuncertainties in identifying and pursuing acquisition targets;\n\u2022\nthe challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits expected from acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe risk that the financial returns on acquisitions will not support the expenditures incurred to acquire such businesses or the capital expenditures needed to develop such businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating the acquired businesses, technologies or product lines;\n\u2022\nthe failure to successfully manage additional business locations, including the additional infrastructure and resources necessary to support and integrate such locations;\n\u2022\nthe existence of unknown product defects related to acquired businesses, technologies or product lines that may not be identified due to the inherent limitations involved in the due diligence process of an acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with entering markets or conducting operations with which we have no or limited direct prior experience;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with assuming the legal obligations of acquired businesses, technologies or product lines;\n\u2022\nrisks related to the effect that internal control processes of acquired businesses might have on our financial reporting and management\u2019s report on our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of, or impairment of our relationships with, current customers or failure to retain the customers of acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nthe inability to qualify the acquired products with OEM partners on a timely basis, or at all;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees related to acquired businesses, technologies or product lines; and\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of significant exit charges if products or technologies acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful.\nFurther, we may never realize the perceived benefits of a business combination or divestiture. Acquisitions by us could negatively impact gross margins or dilute stockholders\u2019 investment and cause us to incur debt, contingent liabilities and amortization/impairment charges related to intangible assets, all of which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Divestitures involve risks, such as difficulty splitting up businesses, distracting employees, potential loss of revenue and negatively impacting margins, and potentially disrupting customer relationships. In addition, our effective tax rate for future periods could be negatively impacted by acquisitions or divestitures.\nWe have made, and could make in the future, investments in technology companies, including privately-held companies in a development stage. Many of these private equity investments are inherently risky because the companies\u2019 businesses may never develop, and we may incur losses related to these investments. In addition, we may be required to write down the carrying value of these investments to reflect other-than-temporary declines in their value, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur products are complex and may contain undetected software or hardware errors that could lead to an increase in our costs, reduce our net revenues or damage our reputation.\nOur products are complex and may contain undetected software or hardware errors when first introduced or as newer versions are released. We are also exposed to risks associated with latent defects in existing products and to risks that components purchased from third-party subcontractors and incorporated into our products may not meet our specifications or may otherwise fail prematurely. From time to time, we have found errors in existing, new or enhanced products. In addition, our products are frequently combined with other products, including software, from other vendors, and these products often need to interface with existing networks, each of which have different specifications and utilize multiple protocol standards. As a result, when problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problems. The occurrence of hardware or software errors could adversely affect the sales of our products, cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs, divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems, any of which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe expect the pricing of our products to continue to decline, which could reduce our revenues, gross margins and profitability.\nWe expect the average unit prices of our products (on a like-for-like product comparison basis) to decline in the future as a result of competitive pricing pressures, increased sales discounts and customer incentives, new product introductions by us or our competitors, or other factors. In addition, the market opportunities we are pursuing in managed service provider and cloud service provider data centers are more price competitive than other markets we serve. If we are unable to offset these factors by increasing sales volumes or reducing product manufacturing costs, our total revenues and gross margins may decline. Moreover, most of our expenses are fixed in the short-term or incurred in advance of receipt of corresponding revenues. As a result, we may not be able to decrease our spending to offset any unexpected shortfall in revenues. If this occurs, our revenues, gross margins and profitability could decline.\nThe migration of our customers toward new products could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs new or enhanced products are introduced, we must successfully manage the transition from older products in order to minimize the effects of product inventories that may become excess and obsolete, as well as ensure that sufficient supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demand. Our failure to manage the transition to newer products in the future or to develop and successfully introduce new products and product enhancements could adversely affect our business or results of operations. In addition, our customers are demanding a higher level of customization for new products, which prevents us\nfrom fully leveraging our product design work and adds to our new product development costs. When we introduce new products and product enhancements, we face additional risks relating to product transitions, including risks relating to forecasting demand and longer lead times associated with smaller product geometries and more complex production operations. Any such adverse event or increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nHistorically, the technology industry has developed higher performance ASICs, which create chip-level solutions that replace selected board-level or box-level solutions at a significantly lower average selling price. We have previously offered ASICs to customers for certain applications that have effectively resulted in a lower-priced solution when compared to an adapter solution. This transition to ASICs may also occur with respect to other current and future products. The result of this transition may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In the future, a similar adverse effect to our business could occur if there were rapid shifts in customer purchases from our midrange networking connectivity products to lower-cost products.\nSales and purchasing patterns with our customers and suppliers are uneven and subject to seasonal fluctuations.\nA large percentage of our products are sold to customers who experience seasonality and uneven sales patterns in their own businesses. As a result, we experience similar seasonality and uneven sales and purchasing patterns with our customers and suppliers. We believe the variability in sales and purchasing patterns results from many factors, including:\n\u2022\nspikes in sales during the fourth quarter of each calendar year typically experienced by our customers, which in turn leads to higher sales volume in our fiscal third quarter;\n\u2022\nthe tendency of our customers to close a disproportionate percentage of their sales transactions in the last month, weeks and days of each quarter, which in turn leads to an increase in our sales during those same time periods; and\n\u2022\nstrategic purchases, including entering into non-cancelable purchase commitments, by us or our customers in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to mitigate risks around product availability.\nThis variability makes it extremely difficult to predict the demand and buying patterns of our customers and, in turn, causes challenges for us in sourcing goods and services from our suppliers, adjusting manufacturing capacity, and forecasting cash flow and working capital needs. If we predict demand that is substantially greater than actual customer orders, we will have excess inventory. Alternatively, if customer orders substantially exceed predicted demand, the ability to assemble, test and ship orders received in the last weeks and days of each quarter may be limited, or be completed at an increased cost, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate has been and could in the future be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those tax laws, by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our effective tax rate is also affected by intercompany transactions for licenses, services, funding and other items. Given the global scope of our operations, and the complexity of global tax and transfer pricing rules and regulations, it is difficult to estimate earnings within each tax jurisdiction. If actual earnings within a tax jurisdiction differ materially from our estimates, we may not achieve our expected effective tax rate.\nAdditionally, our effective tax rate may be impacted by the tax effects of acquisitions, dispositions, changes to tax laws or regulations, examinations by tax authorities, stock-based compensation, uncertain tax positions, and changes in our ability to realize deferred tax assets. Significant judgment and estimates are required in determining the impact on our effective tax rate related to these items, including whether it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will be realized. Such estimates are subject to uncertainty due to various factors, including the economic environment, industry and market conditions, and the length of time of the projections included in the analyses. If our actual results are less favorable than current estimates, or we revise our estimates downward in future analyses, a valuation allowance may be required related to our deferred tax assets with a corresponding adjustment to earnings in the period in which such determination is made, which could have a material effect on our results of operations. In addition, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association of 34 countries including the United States, as well as other taxing authorities have made or are contemplating changes to numerous long-standing tax principles. In particular, due to inconsistencies in application of the arm\u2019s length standard among tax authorities, as well as lack of adequate treaty-based protection, transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could, if successful, result in adjustments for prior or future tax years. Any enacted or contemplated changes may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for income taxes.\nFinally, we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may result in the assessment of additional income taxes. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from examinations to determine the adequacy of our provisions for income taxes. However, unanticipated outcomes from examinations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nBecause we have operations in foreign countries and depend on foreign customers and suppliers, we are subject to international economic, currency, regulatory, political and other risks that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInternational revenues accounted for 67%, 63% and 58% of our net revenues for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net revenues for the foreseeable future. In addition, we maintain operations in foreign countries and a significant portion of our inventory purchases are from suppliers that are located outside the United States. As a result, we are subject to several risks, which include:\n\u2022\na greater difficulty of administering and managing our business globally;\n\u2022\ncompliance with multiple, and potentially conflicting, regulatory requirements, such as import or export requirements, tariffs and other barriers;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in conducting due diligence with respect to business partners in certain international markets;\n\u2022\nless effective intellectual property protections outside of the United States;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations;\n\u2022\noverlapping or differing tax structures;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability, including terrorism and war; and\n\u2022\ngeneral trade restrictions.\nAs of April 3, 2016, our international subsidiaries held $302.3 million of our total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. These holdings by our international subsidiaries consist primarily of debt securities due from U.S. issuers, including the U.S. government and related agencies, and U.S. dollar denominated cash and money market funds. Certain foreign regulations could impact our ability to transfer funds to the United States. Additionally, should we decide to repatriate cash held outside of the United States, we may incur a significant tax obligation.\nOur international sales are invoiced in U.S. dollars and, accordingly, if the relative value of the U.S. dollar in comparison to the currency of our foreign customers should increase, the resulting effective price increase of our products to such foreign customers could result in decreased sales. In addition, a significant portion of our inventory is purchased from international suppliers, who invoice us in U.S. dollars. If the relative value of the U.S. dollar in comparison to the currency of our foreign suppliers should decrease, our suppliers may increase prices, which could result in a decline of our gross margin. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in and compliance with regulations could materially and adversely affect us.\nOur business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if new laws, regulations or standards relating to us or our products are implemented or existing ones are changed. In addition, our compliance with existing regulations may have a material adverse impact on us. For example, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) was enacted in 2010. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas. The SEC has also issued disclosure requirements relating to the sourcing of so-called conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of Congo and certain other adjoining countries. Our disclosures have been and will be predicated upon the timely receipt of accurate information from suppliers, who may be unwilling or unable to provide us with the relevant information. As a result, these requirements could adversely affect our costs, the availability of minerals used in our products and our relationships with customers and suppliers. In addition, we are subject to laws, rules and regulations in the United States and other countries relating to the collection, use and security of personal information and data. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and security standards, protocols and obligations imposed by applicable laws, regulations, industry standards and contracts. Any inability to comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations or other obligations, could result in significant cost and liability, damage our reputation, and adversely affect our business.\nUnder applicable federal securities laws, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. Should we or our\nindependent auditors determine that we have material weaknesses in our internal controls, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be materially and adversely affected and our stock price may decline.\nWe and our customers are subject to various import and export regulations of the United States government and other countries. Certain government export regulations apply to the encryption or other features contained in some of our products. Changes in or violations of any such import or export regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-bribery laws. Although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and material composition of our products, their safe use, the energy consumption associated with those products and product take-back legislation (i.e., legislation that makes producers of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products). We could incur substantial costs, our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions, and we could face other sanctions, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws.\nWe continually seek ways to increase the energy efficiency of our products. Recent analyses have estimated the amount of global carbon emissions that are due to information technology products. As a result, governmental and non-governmental organizations have turned their attention to development of regulations and standards to drive technological improvements and reduce the amount of carbon emissions. There is a risk that these regulations or standards, once developed, will not fully address the complexity of the technology developed by the IT industry or will favor certain technological approaches that we do not currently utilize. Depending on the regulations or standards that are ultimately adopted, compliance could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches and cyber-attacks could disrupt our internal operations, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenues, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.\nExperienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant and, if our efforts to address these problems are not successful, this could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions.\nWe manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business. We have also outsourced a number of our business functions to third party contractors. Breaches of our or our third party contractors\u2019 security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant.\nOur proprietary rights may be inadequately protected and difficult to enforce.\nIn some jurisdictions, we have patent protection on certain aspects of our technology. However, we rely primarily on trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights, that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology, or that we can maintain such technology as trade secrets. There also can be no\nassurance that any patents we possess will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. We have taken steps in several jurisdictions to enforce our trademarks against third parties. No assurances can be given that we will ultimately be successful in protecting our trademarks. The laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, or at all. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, our business could be negatively impacted.\nDisputes relating to claimed infringement of intellectual property rights may adversely affect our business.\nWe have in the past received notices of claimed infringement of intellectual property rights and been involved in intellectual property litigation. There can be no assurance that third parties will not assert future claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us, or against customers or others whom we are contractually obligated to indemnify, with respect to existing and future products. In addition, our supply of ASICs and other components can also be interrupted by intellectual property infringement claims against our suppliers.\nIndividuals and groups are purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as ours. Although patent and intellectual property disputes may be settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and the necessary licenses or similar arrangements may not be available to us on satisfactory terms, or at all. As a result, we could be prevented from manufacturing and selling some of our products. In addition, if we litigate these kinds of claims, the litigation could be expensive, time consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention from other matters and there is no guarantee we would prevail. Our business could suffer regardless of the outcome of the litigation.\nOur facilities and the facilities of our suppliers and customers are located in regions that are subject to natural disasters.\nOur California facilities, including our principal executive offices, our principal design facilities and our critical business operations, are located near major earthquake faults. We are not specifically insured for earthquakes or other natural disasters. Any personal injury at, or damages to, the facilities as a result of such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, we have operations, suppliers and customers in regions that have historically experienced natural disasters. Furthermore, as a result of a natural disaster, our major customers may face shortages of components that could negatively impact their ability to build the servers and data center devices into which our products are integrated, thereby negatively impacting the demand for our products even if the supply of our products is not directly affected by the natural disaster. Any earthquake or other natural disaster, including a hurricane, flood, volcanic eruption, tsunami or fire, affecting any of these regions could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur portfolio of marketable securities could experience a decline in market value, which could materially and adversely affect our financial results.\nAs of April 3, 2016, we held short-term marketable securities totaling $229.4 million. We invest in debt securities, the majority of which are high investment grade, and we limit the exposure to credit risk through diversification and investment in highly-rated securities. However, investing in highly-rated securities does not entirely mitigate the risk of potential declines in market value. A deterioration in the economy, including tightening of credit markets or significant volatility in interest rates, could cause declines in value of our marketable securities or could impact the liquidity of the portfolio. If market conditions deteriorate significantly, our results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies.\nWe expect to continue to transition our ASICs to increasingly smaller line width geometries. This transition requires us to modify the manufacturing processes for our products and to redesign some products, as well as standard cells and other integrated circuit designs that we may use in multiple products. We periodically evaluate the benefits, on a product-by-product basis, of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies. In the past, we have experienced some difficulties in shifting to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes, which resulted in reduced manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries and increased expenses. We may face similar difficulties, delays and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes.\nIf we fail to carefully manage the use of \u201copen source\u201d software in our products, we may be required to license key portions of our products on a royalty-free basis or expose key parts of our source code.\nCertain of our software may be derived from \u201copen source\u201d software that is generally made available to the public by its authors and/or other third parties. Such open source software is often made available to us under licenses, such as the GNU General Public License, that impose certain obligations on us in the event we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software. These obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to the public and license such derivative works under a particular type of license, rather than the forms of licenses customarily used to protect our intellectual property. In the event the copyright holder of any open source software were to successfully establish in court that we had not complied with the terms of a license for a particular work, we could be required to release the source code of that work to the public or stop distributing that work.\nOur ability to borrow and maintain outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement is subject to certain covenants.\nWe have a credit agreement that provides us with a $125 million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures in March 2018. Borrowings under the credit agreement may be used for general corporate purposes, including permitted share repurchases and acquisitions. Under the credit agreement, we may increase the revolving commitments or obtain incremental term loans in an aggregate amount up to $100 million, subject to certain conditions. Our ability to borrow under the credit agreement is subject to continued compliance with certain financial and non-financial covenants. In addition, a breach of any of the covenants or other provisions in the credit agreement could result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could result in outstanding borrowings becoming immediately due and payable. We may be unable to maintain compliance with these covenants and, if we fail to do so, we may be unable to obtain waivers or amend the covenants. In the event that some or all of our outstanding borrowings are accelerated and become immediately due and payable, we may not have the funds to repay, or the ability to refinance, our borrowings. There were no borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement as of April 3, 2016.", "PERMNO": 80266, "SIC": 3570, "TIC": "QLGC"}
