{"cik": "1738827", "company": "KLX Energy Services Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-04-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the information in this Annual Report, including the matters addressed under \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and the following risks before making an investment decision. If any of the following risks or uncertainties or any other risks or uncertainties of which we are currently unaware actually occur, or if any of our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur business depends on domestic capital spending by the oil and natural gas industry, and reductions in capital spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revenues are generated primarily from customers who are engaged in drilling for and production of oil and natural gas. Demand for services in the oil and natural gas industry is cyclical and subject to sudden and significant volatility, and we depend on our customers\u2019 willingness to make capital and operating expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in the United States. In recent years, the oil and gas industry has experienced significant downturns and volatility. The low oil and natural gas prices in 2020 due, in part, to the COVID-19 pandemic, have caused a reduction in cash flows for our customers, which has had a significant adverse effect on the financial condition of some of our customers. This has resulted in, and may continue to result in, lower capital expenditures, project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. These effects have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While oil and gas prices increased in the beginning of 2021, we anticipate oil and natural gas prices will continue to be volatile.\nFactors over which we have no control that could affect our customers\u2019 willingness to undertake drilling, completion, production, and intervention spending activities include:\n\u00b7 The level of prices, and expectations about prices, for oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7 the level of domestic and global oil and natural gas production;\n\u00b7 the level of domestic and global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u00b7 the availability, pricing and perceived safety of pipeline, trucking, train storage and other transportation capacity;\n\u00b7 the supply of and demand for oilfield services and equipment;\n\u00b7 lead times associated with acquiring equipment and availability of qualified personnel;\n\u00b7 the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7 the expected rates of decline in production from existing and prospective wells;\n\u00b7 the discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u00b7 any prolonged reduction in the overall level of oil and natural gas E&P activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise;\n\u00b7 uncertainty in capital and commodities markets and the ability of oil and natural gas E&P companies to raise equity capital and debt financing;\n\u00b7 federal, state and local regulation of hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield service activities, as well as E&P activities, including public pressure on governmental bodies and regulatory agencies to regulate our industry;\n\u00b7 moratoriums on drilling activity resulting in a cessation of operation or a failure to expand operations;\n\u00b7 adverse weather conditions, including rain, tropical storms, hurricanes and severe cold weather, that can affect oil and natural gas operations over a wide area;\n\u00b7 oil refining capacity;\n\u00b7 merger and divestiture activity among oil and gas producers;\n\u00b7 the availability of water resources and suitable proppants in sufficient quantities and on acceptable terms for use in hydraulic fracturing operations;\n\u00b7 the availability, capacity and cost of disposal and recycling services for used hydraulic fracturing fluids;\n\u00b7 the political environment in oil and natural gas producing regions, including uncertainty or instability resulting from civil disorder, terrorism or war;\n\u00b7 worldwide political, military and economic conditions;\n\u00b7 global or national health pandemics, epidemics or concerns, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, which reduced and may further reduce demand for oil and natural gas and related products due to reduced global or national economic activity;\n\u00b7 actions of OPEC, its members and other state controlled oil companies relating to oil and natural gas price and production levels, including announcements of potential changes to such levels;\n\u00b7 advances in exploration, development and production technologies or in technologies affecting energy consumption;\n\u00b7 stockholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas;\n\u00b7 the potential acceleration of development of alternative fuels; and\n\u00b7 the price and availability of alternative fuels and energy sources.\nThe volatility of oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect the demand for our services and negatively impact our results of operations.\nThe demand for our services is primarily determined by current and anticipated oil and natural gas prices and the related levels of capital spending and drilling activity in the areas in which we have operations. Volatility or weakness in oil prices or natural gas prices (or the perception that oil prices or natural gas prices will decrease) affects the spending patterns of our customers and may result in the drilling of fewer new wells. This, in turn, could lead to lower demand for our services and may cause lower utilization of our assets. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, significant fluctuations in operating results as a result of the reactions of our customers to changes in oil and natural gas prices.\nHistorically, prices for oil and natural gas have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be volatile. During the past five years, West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") has ranged from a low of $(36.98) per Bbl in April 2020 to a high of $77.41 per Bbl in June 2018. As of January 29, 2021, WTI closed at $52.16 per Bbl, a 1.1% increase compared to WTI on January 31, 2020. On April 1, 2021, WTI closed at $61.41 per Bbl.\nSignificant factors that are likely to affect commodity prices in current and future periods include, but are not limited to, price reductions or increased production by OPEC members and other oil exporting nations, the effect of U.S. energy, monetary and trade policies, U.S. and global economic conditions, U.S. and global political and economic developments, including initiatives introduced by the Biden Administration and resulting energy and environmental policies, the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and conditions in the U.S. oil and gas industry and the resulting demand for domestic land oilfield services.\nIf the prices of oil and natural gas continue to be volatile or decline, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly reduced demand for our services, and has had, and is likely to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in the United States and globally, together with the significant decline in commodity prices due primarily to the actions of OPEC and other oil producing nations (\u201cOPEC+\u201d), have adversely affected, and are expected to continue to adversely affect, both the price of and demand for crude oil and the continuity of our business operations. Oil demand significantly deteriorated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and corresponding preventative measures taken around the world to mitigate its spread, including \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders, quarantines, executive orders and similar government orders and restrictions for their residents to control the spread of COVID-19. The reduction in oil prices and the ongoing effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic resulted in numerous bankruptcies and consolidations of E&P and oilfield services companies and a significant decline in demand and prices for oilfield services during 2020. We have taken, and are continuing to take, steps to reduce costs, including reductions in capital expenditures, as well as other workforce adjustments and ongoing cost savings initiatives.\nAdditionally, in an effort to minimize the spread of COVID-19, we and our customers have implemented various worksite restrictions in order to minimize contact among personnel. Certain travel restrictions and flight cancellations have also slowed personnel travel and equipment delivery to certain customer locations.\nA recession or long-term market correction resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic could in the future further materially affect the value of our common stock, affect our access to capital and affect our business in the near and long-term. The borrowing base of our $100.0 million senior secured asset-based lending facility (the \u201cABL Facility\u201d) is dependent upon our receivables, which may be significantly lower in the future due to reduced activity levels or decreases in pricing for our services. In addition, if our customers experience financial distress due to the current market conditions, they could default on their payments owed to us and create a credit risk on collecting receivables.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its related effects continue to evolve. The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and any other future pandemic on our business will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the nature, duration and spread of the disease, the vaccination rollout and other responsive actions to stop its spread or address its effects and the duration, timing and the severity of the related consequences on commodity prices and the economy more generally, including any recession resulting from the pandemic. Any further extended period of depressed commodity prices or general economic disruption as a result of a pandemic would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by a deterioration in general economic conditions or a weakening of the broader energy industry.\nThe reduction in oil prices in 2020 and the ongoing effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic created a significant decline in demand and prices for oilfield services during Fiscal 2020. We cannot assure you these conditions will not continue to exist throughout 2021. The risks associated with our business are more acute during periods of economic slowdown or recession because such periods may be accompanied by decreased spending by our customers. A prolonged period of economic slowdown and/or recession in the United States, particularly if coupled with a prolonged slowdown in the E&P industry, would materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe oil and gas industry has historically been both cyclical and seasonal. Activity levels historically have been driven primarily by E&P company capital spending, well completions and workover activity, the geological characteristics of the producing wells and their effect on the services required to commence and maintain production levels, and our customers\u2019 capital and operating budgets. All of these indicators are generally driven by commodity prices, which are affected by both domestic and global supply and demand factors. In particular, while U.S. oil and natural gas prices are correlated with global oil price movements, they are also affected by local markets, weather and consumption patterns.\nOur future results may be impacted by the uncertainty caused by an economic downturn, public health crises, geopolitical issues, volatility or deterioration in the debt and equity capital markets, inflation, deflation or other adverse economic conditions that may negatively affect us or parties with whom we do business resulting in a reduction in our customers\u2019 spending and their non-payment or inability to perform obligations owed to us, such as the failure of customers to honor their commitments or the failure of major suppliers to complete orders.\nOver the past several years, and particularly during the latter half of 2019, an increasing number of E&P companies increased their focus on generating free cash flow; as a result, if oil prices drop or spending for activities exceeds amounts budgeted earlier in their fiscal years, many E&P companies will sharply curtail spending, which negatively impacts demand for our services. This practice has been commonly referred to as \u201cbudget exhaustion\u201d in the industry. The lack of notice of budget exhaustion negatively impacts our hiring practices and operating efficiencies.\nWe may be unable to maintain existing prices or implement price increases on our services.\nOur ability to maintain our existing prices or to implement price increases depends on our customers\u2019 ability and willingness to pay such prices. As a result, and given the volatility in the market, we may not be successful in maintaining our existing prices or, in the future, implementing price increases. Current commodity prices and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant decline in demand and prices for our services in 2020, and we cannot predict the ultimate magnitude or duration of the severe decline in oil and gas prices and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on the prices we charge. Any inability to maintain our pricing or to increase our pricing from reduced levels could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere could also be pressure on our pricing and limitations on our ability to increase prices during future periods of increased market demand when a significant amount of new service capacity, including new well service rigs, wireline units and coiled tubing units, may enter the market. In periods of high demand for oilfield services, a tighter labor market may result in higher labor costs. During such periods, our labor costs could increase at a greater rate than our ability to raise prices. Also, we may not be able to successfully increase prices without adversely affecting our activity levels. Even if we are able to increase our prices in future periods, we may not be able to do so at a rate that is sufficient to offset any rising costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have been expanding our available products and services in recent periods. Our inability to properly manage or support future expansion of our business may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nWe have been expanding our available products and services in recent periods and may continue to expand over time through the internal expansion of products and services and potential acquisitions. Any such expansion, if achieved, could place significant demands on our management team and our operational,\nadministrative and financial resources. We may not be able to expand effectively or manage our expansion successfully, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our common stock to decline.\nIf we lose significant customers, significant customers materially reduce their purchase orders or significant programs on which we rely are delayed, scaled back or eliminated, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur significant customers change from year to year, depending on the level of E&P activity and the use of our services. For the year ended January 31, 2021, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues. Our top five customers for the year ended January 31, 2021 together accounted for approximately 27.8% of our revenues. A reduction in purchases of our products and services by, or the loss of, one of our larger customers for any reason, such as the current industry conditions and economic downturn, insolvency of a customer, decreased production, changes in drilling practices, loss of a customer as a result of the acquisition of such customer by a purchaser who uses a competitor, in-sourcing by customers, a transfer of business to a competitor, failure to adequately service our clients or a strike, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to effectively and efficiently manage our equipment fleet as we expand our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have substantially expanded the size, scope and nature of our business through recent mergers and acquisitions, resulting in an increase in the breadth of our product offerings and an expansion of our business geographically. Business expansion places increasing demands on us to increase the inventories that we carry and/or our equipment fleet. We must anticipate demand well out into the future in order to service our extensive customer base. The inability to effectively and efficiently manage our assets to meet the current and future needs of our customers, which may vary widely from what is originally forecast due to a number of factors beyond our control, including periods of adverse weather, difficult market conditions or slowdowns in oil and natural gas exploration in the various regions in which we operate, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPossible decreased revenues, difficulty in obtaining access to financing and increased funding costs we experience may be exacerbated by the geographic concentrations of our completion and production operations. We could experience any of these conditions at the same time, resulting in a relatively greater impact on our results of operations than they might have on other companies that have more geographically diversified operations. Such delays or interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur recent acquisition activity, including the merger with QES, and any future acquisitions may not be successful in delivering expected performance post-acquisition, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business was created largely through a series of acquisitions. We regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities, frequently engage in acquisition discussions and conduct due diligence activities and, where appropriate, engage in acquisition negotiations, some of which could be material to us. Our ability to continue to achieve our goals may depend upon our ability to effectively identify attractive businesses, access financing sources on acceptable terms, negotiate favorable transaction terms and successfully integrate any businesses we acquire, achieve cost efficiencies and manage these businesses as part of our company.\nOur acquisition and merger activities involve unanticipated delays, costs and other problems. If we encounter unanticipated problems with one of our acquisitions, our senior management may be required to divert attention away from other aspects of our business. We may lose key employees and customers of the acquired and merged businesses, and we may be unable to commercially develop acquired technologies. With any future acquisition or merger, we may also risk entering markets in which we have limited prior experience. Additionally, we may fail to consummate proposed acquisitions or divestitures, after incurring\nexpenses and devoting substantial resources, including management time, to such transactions. Acquisitions also pose the risk that we may be exposed to successor liability relating to actions by an acquired company and its management before the acquisition. The due diligence we conduct in connection with an acquisition, and any contractual guarantees or indemnities that we receive from the sellers of acquired companies, may not be sufficient to protect us from, or compensate us for, actual liabilities that we assume or incur in connection with acquisitions we complete. Additionally, depending upon the acquisition opportunities available, we also may need to raise additional funds through the capital markets or arrange for additional bank financing in order to consummate such acquisitions or to fund capital expenditures necessary to integrate such acquired businesses. We also may not be able to raise the substantial capital required for acquisitions and integrations on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, if we elect to utilize shares of common stock or other equity securities as consideration for one or more acquisitions or business combinations, or if we issue common stock or other equity securities in order to finance one or more acquisitions, existing stockholders of our company could experience dilution in the value of their securities, which could be material.\nThe process of integrating an acquired business may involve unforeseen costs and delays or other operational, technical and financial difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of management attention and financial and other resources. Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to incorporate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry. Competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas. We cannot predict the impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services, and any major changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business involves many hazards and operational risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConditions inherent in the oil and natural gas industry can cause personal injury or loss of life, disruption or suspension in operations, damage to geological formations, damage to facilities, substantial revenue loss, business interruption and damage to, or destruction of, property, equipment and the environment. Our operations are subject to many hazards and risks, including the following:\n\u00b7 equipment defects;\n\u00b7 accidents resulting in serious bodily injury and the loss of life or property;\n\u00b7 damaged or lost equipment;\n\u00b7 liabilities from accidents or damage by our operators or equipment;\n\u00b7 pollution and other damage to the environment;\n\u00b7 well blowouts and the uncontrolled flow of natural gas, oil or other well fluids into or through the environment, including onto or into the ground or into the atmosphere, groundwater, surface water or an underground formation;\n\u00b7 fires, explosions and cratering;\n\u00b7 mechanical or technological failures;\n\u00b7 loss of well control;\n\u00b7 spillage handling and disposing of materials;\n\u00b7 collapse of the boreholes;\n\u00b7 adverse weather conditions; and\n\u00b7 failure of our employees to comply with our internal environmental, health and safety guidelines.\nIf any of these hazards materialize, they could result in the suspension of operations, termination of contracts without compensation, damage to or destruction of our equipment and the property of others, or injury or death to our personnel or third parties and could expose us to substantial liability or losses. Although we customarily include a waiver of consequential damages in our customer contracts, defects or other performance problems in the services or products we offer could result in our customers seeking to invalidate such waiver and seek damages from us for losses associated with these defects or other performance problems. The frequency and severity of such incidents will affect operating costs, insurability and relationships with customers, employees and regulators. Our customers may elect not to purchase our services if they view our safety record as unacceptable or otherwise experience material defects in our products or performance problems, which could cause us to lose customers and substantial revenue, and any litigation or claims, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation with our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future. In addition, these risks may be greater for us upon the acquisition of another company that has not allocated significant resources and management focus to safety and has a poor safety record.\nWe maintain what we believe is customary and reasonable insurance to protect our business against most potential losses, but we are not fully insured against all risks inherent in our business and such insurance may not be adequate to cover our liabilities, especially as the inherent risks in our operations increase with increasing well complexity. For example, although we are insured for environmental pollution resulting from certain environmental accidents that occur on a sudden and accidental basis, we may not be insured against all environmental accidents or events that might occur, some of which may result in toxic tort claims. If a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not adequately insured, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies may substantially increase. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage.\nOur insurance has deductibles or self-insured retentions and contains certain coverage exclusions. The current trend in the insurance industry is towards larger deductibles and self-insured retentions. In addition, insurance may not be available in the future at rates that we consider reasonable and commercially justifiable, compelling us to have larger deductibles or self-insured retentions to effectively manage expenses. As a result, we could become subject to material uninsured liabilities or situations where we have high deductibles or self-insured retentions that expose us to liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition among oilfield service and equipment providers is affected by each provider\u2019s reputation for safety and quality.\nOur activities are subject to a wide range of national, state and local occupational health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, customers maintain their own compliance and reporting requirements. Failure to comply with these health and safety laws and regulations, or failure to comply with our customers\u2019 compliance or reporting requirements, could tarnish our reputation for safety and quality and have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased labor costs, the unavailability of skilled workers or labor-related litigation could hurt our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon a pool of available skilled employees to operate and maintain our business. We compete with other oilfield services businesses and other similar employers to attract and retain qualified personnel with the technical skills and experience required to provide the highest quality service. The demand for skilled workers is high and the supply is limited, and a shortage in the labor pool of skilled workers or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain personnel and could require us to enhance our wage and benefits packages, which could increase our operating costs.\nAlthough our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, union organizational efforts could occur and, if successful, could increase our labor costs. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers or the unionization of groups of our employees could result in increases in the wage rates that we must pay. Likewise, laws and regulations to which we are subject, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act, which governs such matters as minimum wage, overtime and other working conditions, can increase our labor costs or subject us to liabilities to our employees. Our operations are also exposed to risks of claims for alleged employment-related liabilities, including risks of claims related to alleged wrongful termination or discrimination, wage payment practices, retaliation claims and other human resource related matters. We cannot assure you that labor costs will not increase. Increases in our labor costs or unavailability of skilled workers could impair our capacity, diminish our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn recent years, oilfield services companies have been the subject of a significant volume of wage and hour-related litigation, including claims brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act, in which employee pay practices have been challenged. We have been named as defendants in these lawsuits, and we do not maintain insurance for alleged wage and hour-related litigation. Some of these cases remain outstanding and are in various stages of negotiation and/or litigation. The frequency and significance of wage or other employment-related claims may affect expenses, costs and relationships with employees and regulators. Additionally, we could become subject to material uninsured liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and our failure to compete effectively may negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Price competition, equipment availability, location and suitability, experience of the workforce, safety records, reputation, operating integrity and the condition of equipment are all factors used by customers in awarding contracts. Our competitors are numerous and may have greater financial and technological resources than we do. Contracts are traditionally awarded on the basis of competitive bids or direct negotiations with customers. The competitive environment has intensified as recent mergers among E&P companies have reduced the number of available customers and may further increase if E&P company bankruptcies further reduce the number of available customers or our existing and potential customers may develop their own service businesses. The fact that certain oilfield services equipment is mobile and can be moved from one market to another in response to market conditions heightens the competition in the industry. In addition, any increase in the supply of hydraulic fracturing fleets could have a material adverse impact on market prices. This increased supply could also require higher capital investment to keep our services competitive.\nSome of our competitors may have greater financial, technical, marketing and personnel resources than we do. The larger size of many of our competitors provides them with cost advantages as a result of their economies of scale and their ability to obtain volume discounts and purchase raw materials at lower prices.\nAs a result, such competitors may have stronger bargaining power with their suppliers and have an advantage over us in pricing as well as securing a sufficient supply of raw materials during times of shortage. Many of our competitors also have better brand name recognition, stronger presence in certain geographic markets, more established distribution networks, larger customer bases, more in-depth knowledge of the target markets, and the ability to provide a much broader array of services. Some of our competitors may also be able to devote greater resources to the R&D, promotion and sale of their services and products and better withstand the evolving industry standards and changes in market conditions as compared to us. Our operations may be adversely affected if our competitors introduce new products or services with better features, performance, prices or other characteristics than our products and services or expand into service areas where we operate. Our operations may also be adversely affected if our competitors are able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services and changes in customer requirements. Our future success and profitability will partly depend upon our ability to keep pace with our customers\u2019 demands for awarding contracts.\nThe competitive pressures described herein, and any others we may not currently be aware of, could reduce our market share or require us to reduce the price of our services and products, particularly during industry downturns, either of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Significant increases in overall market capacity have also caused active price competition and led to lower pricing and utilization levels for our services and products. The competitive environment has intensified since the industry downturn that began in late 2019, which caused an oversupply of, and reduced demand for, oilfield services, and we have seen substantial reductions in the prices we can charge for our services. Any significant future increase in overall market capacity for completion, intervention and production services may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSeasonal and adverse weather conditions adversely affect demand for services and operations.\nWeather can have a significant impact on demand as consumption of energy is seasonal, and any variation from normal weather patterns, such as cooler or warmer summers and winters, can have a significant impact on demand. Adverse weather conditions, including rain, tropical storms, hurricanes, tornadoes and severe cold weather, may interrupt or curtail operations, our customers\u2019 operations, cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured. Specifically, we typically have experienced a pause by our customers around the holiday season in the fourth quarter, which may be compounded as our customers exhaust their annual capital spending budgets towards year end. Additionally, our operations are directly affected by weather conditions, which can severely disrupt the normal operation of our business and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. During the winter months (first and fourth quarters) and periods of heavy snow, ice or rain, particularly in the northeastern U.S., Colorado, North Dakota and Wyoming, our customers may delay operations or we may not be able to operate or move our equipment between locations. Also, during the spring thaw, which normally starts in late March and continues through June, some areas impose transportation restrictions to prevent damage caused by the spring thaw. In addition, throughout the year heavy rains adversely affect activity levels, as dirt access roads can become impassible in wet conditions and well locations become inaccessible.\nIn February of 2021, we experienced a material slow down due to the unprecedented North American Winter Storm Uri, the costliest winter storm in U.S. history. As a result of the storm conditions, our customers shut in wells and delayed work causing us at least seven days of lost revenue, primarily in the Permian and the Mid-continent regions.\nRisks Relating to Financial Considerations\nWe have operated at a loss, and there is no assurance of our profitability in the future.\nWe have experienced periods of low demand for our services and have incurred operating losses. As discussed above, current commodity prices and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a global recession with numerous E&P and oilfield services companies filing bankruptcy and a significant decline in demand and prices for our services in 2020. We serve customers who are involved in drilling for and production of oil and natural gas. Demand for services in the oil and natural gas industry is cyclical, is\ncurrently experiencing a significant downturn and has experienced additional significant downturns in recent years, which are currently significantly affecting, and have in recent years significantly affected, the performance of our business. Additional adverse developments affecting this industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to sufficiently reduce our costs or increase our revenues to achieve profitability and generate positive operating income. We may incur further operating losses and experience negative operating cash flow, which may be significant. We cannot predict the ultimate magnitude or duration of the severe decline in oil and gas prices and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or when our business may no longer be adversely affected.\nWe may need to obtain additional capital or financing to fund expansion of our asset base, which could increase our financial leverage, or we may not be able to finance our capital needs.\nIn order to expand our asset base, we may need to make significant capital expenditures. If we do not make sufficient or effective capital expenditures, we will be unable to organically expand our business operations.\nWe intend to fund our future capital expenditures primarily with cash flows from operating activities and existing cash balances. To the extent our cash and cash flows from operating activities are not sufficient, we could borrow under our ABL Facility. Availability under the ABL Facility is determined primarily by a borrowing base formula calculated based on a percentage of our accounts receivable and inventory, net of a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (\u201cFCCR\u201d) holdback of $10.0, was $34.9 as of January 31, 2021.\nThe ABL Facility includes a financial covenant which requires the Company\u2019s FCCR to be at least 1.0 to 1.0 if availability falls below the greater of $10.0 or 15% of the borrowing base. As of January 31, 2021, the FCCR was below 1.0 to 1.0. The Company was in full compliance with its credit facility as of January 31, 2021.\nThe terms of the indenture that governs our 11.5% senior secured notes due 2025 (the \u201cNotes\u201d), the credit agreement that governs the ABL Facility and the agreements that will govern any future debt and equity instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. If debt and equity capital or alternative financing plans are not available on favorable terms or at all, we would be required to either get the necessary consents to amend the terms of our debt to allow us to pursue additional financing alternatives or curtail our capital spending, and our ability to sustain or improve our profits may be adversely affected. Our ability to refinance or restructure our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time, among other things. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. A rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on the price of our shares, or our ability to issue equity or incur debt for acquisitions or other purposes. In addition, incurring additional debt would result in increased interest expense and financial leverage, and issuing common stock may result in significant dilution to our current stockholders.\nOur assets require capital for maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment, and we may require capital expenditures for new equipment.\nOur equipment requires periodic capital investment in maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment to maintain its competitiveness. The costs of components and labor have increased in the past and may increase in the future with increases in demand, which will require us to incur additional costs to upgrade any equipment we may acquire in the future. Our equipment typically does not generate revenue while it is undergoing maintenance, refurbishment or upgrades. Any maintenance, upgrade or refurbishment project for our assets could increase our indebtedness or reduce cash available for other opportunities. Further, such projects may require proportionally greater capital investments as a percentage of total asset value, which may make such projects difficult to finance on acceptable terms. To the extent we are unable to fund such projects, we may have less equipment available for service or our equipment may not be attractive to potential or current customers. Moreover, if the current period of low demand for our services and challenging business conditions in the energy sector generally persists for a prolonged period, we may be unable to make capital investments. Additionally, competition or advances in technology within our industry may require us to update our products and services. Such demands on our capital or reductions in demand and the increase in cost to\nmaintain labor necessary for such maintenance and improvement, in each case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased leverage could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have $250.0 million principal amount outstanding of Notes due 2025, and we may incur additional debt under our ABL Facility or otherwise to finance our operations or for future expansion, including funding acquisitions. A high degree of leverage could have important consequences to us. For example, it could:\n\u00b7 increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of cash from operations to the payment of debt service, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7 limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate purposes or acquisitions;\n\u00b7 place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged;\n\u00b7 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in our industry; and\n\u00b7 make us vulnerable to increases in interest rates if we borrow under our ABL Facility, as any such borrowings would be made at variable interest rates.\nOur ability to borrow under the ABL Facility will depend upon availability thereunder. The amount of our availability is tied to the aggregate amount of our accounts receivable and inventory that satisfy specified criteria as well as our maintaining a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. Our ability to make payments on and refinance our current debt and any future debt that we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that we cannot control. If we cannot service our debt or repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions, including (1) reducing financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes or (2) dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness. The lenders or other investors who hold debt that we fail to service or on which we otherwise default could also accelerate amounts due, which could in such an instance potentially trigger a default or acceleration of other debt we may incur.\nThe indenture that governs the Notes and the credit agreement that governs the ABL Facility have significant financial and operating restrictions that may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe indenture that governs the Notes and the credit agreement that governs the ABL Facility contain financial, operating and/or negative covenants that limit our ability to incur indebtedness, to create liens or other encumbrances, to make certain payments and investments, including dividend payments, to engage in transactions with affiliates, to engage in sale/leaseback transactions, to guarantee indebtedness and to sell or otherwise dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with other entities. Agreements governing our future indebtedness could also contain significant financial and operating restrictions. A failure to comply with the obligations contained in any such agreement governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default under such agreement, which could permit acceleration of the related debt, enforcement against any liens securing the related debt and acceleration of debt under other instruments that may contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions. We may not have, or may not be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make any required accelerated payments.\nWe may experience future impairment charges.\nTo conduct our business operations and execute our strategy, we acquire tangible and intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we may incur. The risk of impairment may be heightened for the duration of the current industry conditions, which may\npersist for a prolonged period. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our financial statements. As part of our strategy, we may make additional acquisitions, which may result in the addition of duplicative assets. In the event such an acquisition results in the combined assets of our Company and the acquired assets being in excess of any reasonable forecast of future need, the excess portion of the book value of these assets may be judged to be impaired. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, we assess potential impairment to long-lived assets (property and equipment and amortized intangible assets) when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. Our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets is based on operational performance of our acquired businesses, expected changes in the global economy, oil and gas price and industry projections, discount rates and other judgmental factors. We would be required to record any such impairment losses resulting from any such test as a charge to operating results. To perform the annual assessment, we utilize a combination of income and market-based approaches to value the reporting units. The income approach to valuation relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit, which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate. The annual goodwill impairment test requires us to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins and working capital requirements, which are based upon our long-term strategic plan. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant, whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt, including a risk premium. Any future impairment loss could have a material non-cash adverse impact on our results of operations.\nThe oilfield service industry experienced an abrupt deterioration in demand during the second half of 2019, which continued into 2020. During the first quarter of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic emerged and applied significant downward pressure on the global economy and oil demand and prices, leading North American operators to announce significant cuts to planned 2020 capital expenditures. The combination of the COVID-19 pandemic and supply concerns drove a steep drop in oil prices, which led to decreases in demand for the Company\u2019s services and lower current and expected revenues for the Company.\nThe Company performed a goodwill and long-lived asset impairment analysis as of the April 30, 2020. The results of the impairment analysis concluded that the carrying amount of the long-lived assets exceeded the relative fair values of two of the reporting units asset groups. As a result, the Company recorded a $180.4 long-lived asset impairment charge, $39.2 related to intangible assets and $141.2 related to property and equipment, which is included in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended January 31, 2021. This charge reflects $91.3 and $89.1 of the long-lived assets attributable to the Southwest and Northeast/Mid-Con segments, respectively.\nThe results of the goodwill impairment test as of April 30, 2020 indicated that goodwill was impaired because the carrying value of the Rocky Mountains reporting unit exceeded its relative fair value. Accordingly, the Company recorded a $28.3 goodwill impairment charge, which is included in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended January 31, 2021. This charge reflects the full value of the goodwill attributable to the Rocky Mountains segment, leaving the Company with no goodwill as of January 31, 2021.\nThe Company recorded a $47.0 goodwill impairment charge during the year ended January 31, 2020, which is included in the consolidated statements of operations. The charges reflected the full value of the goodwill attributable to the Northeast/Mid-Con and Southwest segments.\nCustomer payment delays of outstanding receivables and customer bankruptcies could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.\nWe often provide credit to our customers for our services, and we are therefore subject to the risk of our customers delaying or failing to pay outstanding invoices. Although we monitor individual customer financial viability in granting such credit arrangements and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful account, in weak economic environments, customers\u2019 delays and failures to pay often increase due to, among other reasons, a reduction in our customers\u2019 cash flow from operations and their\naccess to credit markets. If our customers delay or fail to pay a significant amount of outstanding receivables, it could reduce our availability under our revolving credit facility or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSome of our customers have entered bankruptcy proceedings in the past, and certain of our customers\u2019 businesses face financial challenges that put them at risk of future bankruptcies. Customer bankruptcies could delay or in some cases eliminate our ability to collect accounts receivable that are outstanding at the time the customer enters bankruptcy proceedings. We are also at risk that we may be required to refund amounts collected from a customer during the period immediately prior to that customer\u2019s bankruptcy filing, and the amount we ultimately collect from the customer\u2019s bankruptcy estate may be significantly less. Customer bankruptcies may also reduce our availability under our revolving credit facility. Although we maintain reserves for potential customer credit losses, customer bankruptcies could result in unanticipated credit losses. As a result, if one or more of our customers enter bankruptcy proceedings, particularly our larger customers or those to whom we have greater credit exposure, it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, operating results and financial condition.\nOn March 9, 2021, the Company filed claims in the District Court of Harris, County Texas against Magellan E&P Holdings, Inc. (\"Magellan\"), Redmon-Keys Insurance Group, Inc. and Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's (\"Underwriters\") to recover $4.6 million owed on invoices duly issued by the Company for services rendered on behalf of defendants in response to an offshore well blowout near Bob Hall Pier in Corpus Christi, Texas. Magellan did not dispute the invoices but alleged an inability to pay prior to obtaining funding from Underwriters under Magellan's Owner's Extra Expense insurance policy (\"OEE\"). On March 19, 2021, Underwriters filed a declaratory judgment action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas seeking a declaration that approximately half of all blowout related expenses fall outside of policy coverage. On March 30, 2021, Magellan filed for bankruptcy pursuant to Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy code. The Company believes that the OEE policy is now an asset of the Chapter 7 estate. The bankruptcy proceedings are in their initial stages. At this time, the Company has reserved the full amount of its invoices totaling $4.6 million as a prudent action in light of the Chapter 7 filing. However, we believe that the proceeds from the OEE policy will ultimately be allocated to the blowout creditors and will be offering our support to the U.S. Trustee in its pursuit of full recovery under the OEE policy from Underwriters.\nWe have identified and remediated a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which may result in material misstatements of our financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations.\nWe and our independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2020. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness is related to inadequate review of the measurement of depreciation expense for impaired property and equipment.\nBeginning in the third quarter of 2020, we developed a plan to remediate the material weakness and have taken steps that we believe address the underlying causes of the material weakness. Changes to controls included, but were not limited to, transitioning key roles following the Merger, hiring of additional accounting personnel, providing training, and enhancing review controls of the measurement of depreciation expense.\nThe material weakness is now considered to be remediated as the applicable controls and procedures implemented through our remediation plan have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls were operating effectively as of January 31, 2021.\nWe can give no assurance that any additional material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls. In addition, even if we are successful in strengthening our controls and\nprocedures, in the future those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements.\nAny failure to maintain effective internal controls could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis. Ineffective internal controls could also potentially cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWhen we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the federal securities laws, our registered public accounting firm will be required to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls. If we are unable to confirm that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could potentially lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Relating to Third Parties\nShortages or increases in the costs of the equipment we use in our operations could adversely affect our operations in the future.\nWe generally do not have specialized tools, trucks or long-term contracts in place that provide for the delivery of equipment, including, but not limited to, replacement parts and other equipment. We could experience delays in the delivery of the equipment that we have ordered and its placement into service due to factors that are beyond our control. Demand by other oilfield services companies and numerous other factors beyond our control could either adversely affect our ability to procure equipment that we have not yet ordered or cause the prices of such equipment to increase. Price increases, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply may require us to increase capital and repair expenditures and incur higher operating costs. Each of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on a small number of suppliers for key goods and services that we use in our operations.\nWe do not have long-term contracts with third-party suppliers of many of the goods and services used in large volumes in our operations, including manufacturers of technical services equipment and fishing tools, chargers and other tools and equipment used in our operations. If demand for goods and services exceeds supply, such as from disruptions to the supply chain or supplier bankruptcies, the availability of certain goods and services used in our industry decreases and the price of such goods and services increases. We are dependent on a small number of suppliers for key goods and services. During the twelve months ended January 31, 2021, based on total purchase cost, our ten largest suppliers of goods and services represented approximately 28.6% of all such purchases. Our reliance on such suppliers could increase the difficulty of obtaining such goods and services in the event of a disruption to the supply chain or upon a bankruptcy of one or more of these suppliers or upon a shortage in our industry. Price increases, delays in delivery and interruptions in supply may require us to incur higher operating costs. Each of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on a limited number of third parties for sand, proppant and chemicals, and delays in deliveries of such materials, increases in the cost of such materials or our contractual obligations to pay for materials that we ultimately do not require could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have established relationships with a limited number of suppliers of our raw materials (such as sand, proppant and chemical additives). Should any of our current suppliers be unable to provide the necessary materials or otherwise fail to deliver the materials in a timely manner and in the quantities required, any resulting delays in our ability to provide our services could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete, business, financial condition and results of operations. While we believe that we will be able to make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of any interruption in the supply of these materials and/or products by one of our suppliers, we may not always be able to make alternative arrangements. In\naddition, certain materials for which we do not currently have long-term supply agreements could experience shortages and significant price increases in the future. Increasing costs of such materials may negatively impact demand for our services or the profitability of our business operations. In the past, our industry faced sporadic proppant shortages associated with hydraulic fracturing operations requiring work stoppages, which adversely impacted the operating results of several competitors. We may not be able to mitigate any future shortages of materials, including proppant and our results of operations, prospects and financial condition could be adversely affected. Furthermore, to the extent our contracts require us to purchase more materials, including proppant, than we ultimately require, we may be forced to pay for the excess amount under \u201ctake or pay\u201d contract provisions.\nAn increase in the cost of proppant as a result of increased demand or a decrease in the number of proppant providers as a result of consolidation could increase our cost of an essential raw material in hydraulic stimulation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf suppliers are unable to supply us with the products used in our operations in a timely manner, in adequate quantities and/or at a reasonable cost, we may be unable to meet the demands of our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on third-party companies to support our operations through the timely supply of products. Our suppliers may experience capacity constraints that may result in their inability to supply us with products in a timely fashion, with adequate quantities or at a desired price. Factors affecting suppliers can include labor disputes, general economic issues, and changes in raw material and energy costs. Natural disasters such as earthquakes or hurricanes, as well as political instability, global or national health pandemics, epidemics or concerns, such as the recent COVID-19 pandemic, and terrorist activities, may negatively impact the production or delivery capabilities of our suppliers as well. These factors could lead to increased prices and/or the unfavorable allocation of products by our suppliers, which could reduce our revenues and profit margins and harm our customer relations. Significant disruptions in our supply chain could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Technology and Intellectual Property\nOur inability to develop, obtain, maintain or implement new technology may cause us to become less competitive.\nThe energy services industry is subject to the introduction of new drilling, completion and well intervention techniques using new technologies, some of which may be subject to patent protection or costly to obtain. As competitors and others use or develop new technologies in the future, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage if we fail to keep pace with technological advancements within our industry. If we cannot obtain patents or other protection for the intellectual property in our technology, it may not be economical for us to continue to develop systems, services, and technologies to meet evolving industry requirements at prices acceptable to our customers. Furthermore, we may face competitive pressure to implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost. Some of our competitors are large national and multinational companies that may have greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and personnel resources that may allow them to enjoy technological advantages and implement new systems, services and technologies before we can. These large national and multinational companies may also have a larger number of manufacturers for their products or ability to manufacture their own products. We cannot be certain that we will be able to implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost and as competitors and others use or develop new or comparable technologies in the future, we may lose market share or be placed at a competitive disadvantage. New technology could also make it easier for our oil and natural gas E&P customers to vertically integrate their operations, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for our services. Thus, limits on our ability to effectively use and implement new and emerging technologies may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently rely on a limited number of manufacturers for production of the proprietary products used in the\nprovision of our products and services. Termination of the manufacturing relationship with any of these manufacturers could affect our ability to provide such products and services to our customers. Although we believe other alternate sources of supply for our proprietary products exist, we would need to establish relationships with new manufacturers, which could potentially involve significant expense, delay, and potential changes to certain product components. Any protracted curtailment or interruptions of the supply of any of our\nkey products, whether or not as a result of termination of our manufacturing relationships or patent infringement claims, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business, and results of operations.\nOur success may be affected by our ability to use and protect our proprietary technology as well as our ability to enter into license agreements.\nOur success may be affected by our development and implementation of new product designs and improvements and by our ability to protect, obtain and maintain intellectual property assets related to these developments. We rely on a combination of patents and trade secret laws to establish and protect proprietary technology. We have received patents and have filed patent applications with respect to certain aspects of our technology, and we generally rely on patent protection with respect to our proprietary technology, as well as a combination of trade secrets, employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect intellectual property rights pertaining to our products and technologies. We cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe upon, misappropriate, violate or challenge our intellectual property rights in the future. Further, we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will deter or prevent competitors from creating similar purpose products for our customers. If we are not able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, such intellectual property rights may not provide significant value to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, our rights in our confidential information, trade secrets and confidential know-how will not prevent third-parties from independently developing similar technologies or duplicating such technologies. Publicly available information (e.g., information in issued patents, published patent applications and scientific literature) can be used by third-parties to independently develop technology, and we cannot provide assurance that this independently developed technology will not be equivalent or superior to our proprietary technology. In addition, while we have patented some of our key technologies, we do not seek patent protection for all of our proprietary technology, even when regarded as patentable. The process of seeking patent protection can be long and expensive. There can be no assurance that patents will be issued from currently pending or future applications or that, if patents are issued, they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us. Further, with respect to exclusive third-party arrangements, these arrangements could be terminated, which would result in our inability to provide the services and/or products covered by such arrangements.\nWe may be adversely affected by disputes regarding intellectual property rights and the value of our intellectual property rights is uncertain.\nWe may become involved in dispute resolution proceedings from time to time to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. In these dispute resolution proceedings, a defendant may assert that our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable. Third-parties from time to time may also initiate dispute resolution proceedings against us by asserting that our business, services, or products infringe, impair, misappropriate, dilute or otherwise violate another party\u2019s intellectual property rights. We may not prevail in any such dispute resolution proceedings, and our intellectual property rights may be found invalid or unenforceable or our products and services may be found to infringe, impair, misappropriate, dilute or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others. The results or costs of any such dispute resolution proceedings may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any dispute resolution proceeding concerning intellectual property could be protracted and costly, is inherently unpredictable and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, regardless of its outcome.\nIf we were to discover that our technologies infringe valid intellectual property rights of third parties, we may need to obtain licenses from these parties or substantially re-engineer our technologies in order to avoid infringement. We may not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms, or at all, or be able to re-engineer our technologies successfully. Also, as a part of resolving such disputes, we may need to enter into cross-licenses, which could reduce the value of our existing intellectual property rights. If our inability to obtain required licenses for certain technologies or products prevents us from using the infringed technologies or products, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.\nOur operations rely on an extensive network of information technology resources and a failure to maintain, upgrade and protect such systems could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our operations are subject to cyber security risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInformation technology plays a crucial role in all of our operations. To remain competitive, our hardware, software and related services must properly and efficiently interact with our suppliers\u2019 and customers' products, services and technology record and process our financial transactions accurately, and obtain accurate and timely data and information to enable our analysis of trends and plans and the execution of our strategies. At the same time, cyber incidents have increased. A cyber incident could be caused by malicious insiders or third parties using sophisticated, targeted methods to circumvent firewalls, encryption, and other security defenses, including hacking, fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. Our information technology systems, and networks, and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners, are subject to possible breaches and other threats that could cause us harm. If our systems for protecting against cyber security risks prove not to be sufficient, we could be adversely affected by, among other things, loss or damage of intellectual property, proprietary information, or customer data; interruption of business operations; reputational harm; or additional costs to prevent, respond to, or mitigate cyber security attacks. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. We have implemented reasonable security measures that are designed to detect and protect against cyber incidents. However, the area of the law related to cyber security requirements develops at a rapid pace and we may not be able to monitor and react to all developments in a timely manner. As legislation continues to develop and cyber incidents continue to evolve, we will likely be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. Likewise, our business involves collection, uses, and other processing of personal data of our employees, contractors, suppliers, and service providers, and such personal collection, use and processing is subject to a changing landscape of privacy laws, rules and regulations. As the privacy landscape continues to develop, we will likely be required to expend significant resources to continue to modify or enhance our compliance measures to comply with such laws, rules and regulations, and our failure to comply with such laws, rules and regulations could result in significant liability. Our systems and insurance coverage for cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks, may not be sufficient to cover all of the losses we may experience as a result of such cyberattacks. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, reputation, and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Government Regulation and Legal Matters\nOilfield anti-indemnity provisions enacted by many states may restrict or prohibit a party\u2019s indemnification of us.\nWe typically enter into agreements with our customers governing the provision of our services, which usually include certain indemnification provisions for losses resulting from operations. These agreements may require each party to indemnify the other against certain claims regardless of the negligence or other fault of the indemnified party; however, many states place limitations on contractual indemnity provisions, particularly agreements that indemnify a party against the consequences of its own negligence. Furthermore, certain states, including Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming, have enacted statutes generally referred to as \u201coilfield anti-indemnity acts\u201d expressly prohibiting certain indemnity agreements contained in or related to\noilfield services agreements. Such oilfield anti-indemnity acts may restrict or void a party\u2019s indemnification of us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in trucking regulations may increase our transportation costs and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate trucks and other heavy equipment for the transportation and relocation of our oilfield services equipment and are therefore subject to regulation as a motor carrier by the Department of Transportation (\"DOT\") and analogous state agencies, whose regulations include authorizations to engage in motor carrier operations and regulatory safety. In addition, regulations issued by environmental and highway safety regulators can have an adverse impact on our trucking costs, and therefore, on our results of operations. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation and Environmental, Health and Safety Matters\u201d for more discussion on the DOT and analogous state legal requirements relating to trucking matters. While we cannot predict whether, or in what form, any legislation or regulatory and executive actions that change existing trucking legal requirements will occur, we may incur increased expenses associated with new or changed trucking laws, regulatory and executory actions, or other restrictions, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal requirements relating to hydraulic fracturing could increase our customers\u2019 costs of doing business, limit the areas in which our customers can operate and reduce oil and natural gas production by our customers, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing but provide products and services in support of our customers\u2019 fracturing activities. The practice is controversial in certain parts of the country and there remains increased scrutiny and government regulation of the hydraulic fracturing process. Additionally, with concerns about seismic activity resulting from injection of produced wastewaters into underground disposal wells, certain regulators are also considering additional requirements related to seismic safety. Our customers\u2019 inability to locate or contractually acquire and sustain the receipt of sufficient amounts of water could also adversely impact their operations. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation and Environmental, Health and Safety Matters\u201d for more discussion on these hydraulic fracturing, seismicity and water availability matters. One or more of these developments could decrease completion of our customers\u2019 oil and gas wells, increase our and our customers\u2019 compliance costs and reduce demand for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe and our customers are subject to environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that could increase our or our customers\u2019 costs of doing business and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations and our customers\u2019 operations are subject to stringent federal, tribal, state and local laws and regulations governing worker health and safety, protection of the environment, including natural resources, and management, transportation and disposal of wastes and other materials. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation and Environmental, Health and Safety Matters\u201d for more discussion on these matters. One or more of these developments could adversely impact our customers\u2019 operations, increase our and our customers\u2019 compliance costs and reduce demand for our products and services, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur and our customers\u2019 operations are subject to a number of risks arising out of the threat of climate change, which could result in increased operating and capital costs for us and our customers and reduced demand for the products and services we provide.\nThe threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and foreign countries and, as a result, our and our customers\u2019 operations are subject to regulatory, political, litigation and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of GHGs. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation and Environmental, Health and Safety Matters\u201d for more\ndiscussion on the risks associated with attention to the threat of climate change and restriction of GHG emissions. New or amended legislation, executive actions, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent oil and gas sector standards for GHG emissions or restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate GHG emissions could result in increased compliance costs or costs of consuming fossil fuels. Additionally, political, financial and litigation risks may result in our customers restricting, delaying or canceling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes, or impairing the ability to continue to operate in an economic manner, which could reduce demand for our products and services. Fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements and increasing consumer demand for alternatives energy sources (such as wind, solar, geothermal and tidal) could also reduce demand for oil and natural gas. The occurrence of one or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be required to assume responsibility for environmental and other liabilities of companies we have acquired or will acquire.\nWe may incur liabilities in connection with environmental conditions currently unknown to us relating to our existing, prior or future operations or those of predecessor companies whose liabilities we may have assumed or acquired. We also could be subject to third-party and governmental claims with respect to environmental matters, including claims under CERCLA in instances where we are identified as a potentially responsible party. We believe that indemnities provided to us in certain of our pre-existing acquisition agreements may cover certain environmental conditions existing at the time of the acquisition, subject to certain terms, limitations and conditions. However, if these indemnification provisions terminate or if the indemnifying parties do not fulfill their indemnification obligations, we may be subject to liability with respect to the environmental matters that those indemnification provisions address.\nWe face risks from increasing activism against, and negative investor sentiment towards the oil and gas industry, which may adversely impact our business.\nOpposition towards oil and gas drilling and development activity has been growing globally and is particularly pronounced in the United States. Companies in the oil and gas industry have frequently been the target of activist efforts regarding environmental and safety matters as well as business practices but, in recent years, have been facing increasing scrutiny on its environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) practices, which includes such areas as sustainability, human rights and environmental social justice. Furthermore, certain segments of the investor community have developed negative sentiment towards investing in the oil and gas industry, with some investors (including certain investment advisers, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, university endowments and family foundations) having introduced policies to disinvest in the oil and gas sector for stated social and environmental considerations. Commercial and investment banks have also faced pressure to stop financing oil and gas production and related projects. Companies which do not adapt to or comply with investor or stakeholder expectations and standards, which are evolving, or which are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may suffer from reputational damage and the business, financial condition, and/or stock price of such a company could be materially and adversely affected. Increasing attention to climate change, increasing societal expectations on companies to address climate change, and potential consumer use of substitutes to energy commodities may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our customers\u2019 hydrocarbon products and our products and services, reduced profits, increased investigations and litigation, and negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets.\nIn addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Currently, there are no universal standards for such scores or ratings, but the importance of sustainability evaluations is becoming more broadly accepted by investors and shareholders. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Additionally, certain investors use these scores to benchmark companies against their peers and if a company is perceived as lagging, these investors may engage with companies to require improved ESG disclosure or performance. Moreover, certain members of the broader\ninvestment community may consider a company\u2019s sustainability score as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision. Consequently, a low sustainability score could result in exclusion of our stock from consideration by certain investment funds, engagement by investors seeking to improve such scores and a negative perception of our operations by certain investors.\nRestrictions, delays or cancellations imposed by governmental authorities in issuing permits or leases for our or our customers\u2019 operations could impair our business.\nWe and our customers are required to obtain permits from one or more governmental agencies in order to perform certain activities. Such permits are typically required by state agencies but can also be required by federal and local governmental agencies. Moreover, some of our customers\u2019 drilling and completion activities may take place on federal land or Native American lands, requiring leases and other approvals from the federal government or Native American tribes to conduct such drilling and completion activities. The requirements for such permits vary depending on the type of operations, including the location where our customers\u2019 drilling and completion activities will be conducted. As with all governmental permitting processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit to be issued and the conditions that may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit. Certain regulatory authorities have delayed or suspended the issuance of permits while the potential environmental impacts associated with issuing such permits can be studied and appropriate mitigation measures evaluated. Also, in some cases, federal agencies have cancelled proposed leases for federal lands and refused or delayed required approvals. Permitting or lease delays, an inability to obtain or renew permits or leases, or revocation of our or our customers\u2019 current permits could cause a loss of revenue and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation and Environmental, Health and Safety Matters\u201d for more discussion on permitting and leasing matters, including actions under the Biden Administration that may adversely affect oil and natural gas leasing and permitting activities. Consequently, our customers\u2019 operations in certain areas of the United States may be interrupted or suspended for varying lengths of time, resulting in reduced demand for our products and services and a corresponding loss of revenue to us as well as adversely affecting our results of operations in support of those customers.\nSilica-related legal requirements, including compliance with OSHA regulations relating to respirable crystalline silica or litigation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and reputation.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations relating to human exposure to crystalline silica. See Part I, Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Government Regulation and Environmental, Health and Safety Matters\u201d for more discussion on exposure to crystalline silica and other occupational health and safety matters. If we are unable to satisfy these exposure requirements, or are not able to do so in a manner that is cost effective or attractive to our customers, availability or demand for our products and services could be significantly affected and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations relating to exposure to crystalline silica that are adopted, or that the costs of complying with such future laws and regulations would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results by requiring us to modify or cease our operations. Moreover, the actual or perceived health risks of handling hydraulic fracturing sand could materially and adversely affect hydraulic fracturing service providers, including us, through reduced use of hydraulic fracturing sand, the threat of product liability or employee or third-party lawsuits, increased scrutiny by federal, state and local regulatory authorities of us and our E&P customers or reduced financing sources available to the hydraulic fracturing industry.\nExplosive incidents arising out of dangerous materials used in our business could disrupt operations and result in bodily injuries and property damages, which occurrences could have a material adverse effect our business, results of operations and financial conditions.\nOur operations include the licensing, storage and handling of explosive materials that are subject to regulation by the ATF and analogous state agencies. Despite our use of specialized facilities to store and handle dangerous materials and our performance of employee training programs, the storage and handling of\nexplosive materials could result in explosive incidents that temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupt our or our customers' operations or could cause restrictions, delays or cancellations in the delivery of our services. It is possible that such incidents could result in death or significant injuries to employees and other persons. Material property damage to us, our customers and third parties arising from an explosion or resulting fire could also occur. Any explosion could expose us to adverse publicity and liability for damages and injuries or cause production restrictions, delays or cancellations, any of which occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable requirements or the occurrence of an explosive incident may also result in the loss of our ATF or analogous state license to store and handle explosives, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial conditions.\nThe ESA and comparable laws intended to protect certain species of wildlife govern our and our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers\u2019 operations, which constraints could have an adverse impact on our ability to expand some of our existing operations or limit our customers\u2019 ability to develop new oil and natural gas wells.\nThe federal ESA and comparable state laws were established to protect endangered and threatened species. Under the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (\u201cMBTA\u201d). The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (\u201cFWS\u201d) under former President Trump issued a final rule in January 2021, which notably clarifies that criminal liability under the MBTA will apply only to actions \u201cdirected at\u201d migratory birds, its nests, or its eggs; however, on March 8, 2021, the Biden Administration announced that it would revoke this January 2021 rule and may possibly reevaluate how the MBTA is implemented. Customer oil and natural gas operations may be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife, which may limit their ability to operate in protected areas. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered and threatened species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. Moreover, the FWS may make determinations on the listing of numerous species as endangered or threatened under the ESA, which listings could indirectly cause our customers to incur additional costs, become subject to operating restrictions or bans, and limit future development activity in affected areas, which could reduce demand for our products and services to those customers.\nWe may be subject to claims for personal injury and property damage or other litigation, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur services are subject to inherent risks that can cause personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment or the suspension of our operations. As the wells we service continue to become more complex, our exposure to such inherent risks becomes greater as downhole risks increase exponentially with an increase in complexity and lateral length. Litigation arising from operations where our facilities are located, or our services are provided, may cause us to be named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting potentially large claims including claims for exemplary damages. For example, transportation of heavy equipment creates the potential for our trucks to become involved in roadway accidents, which in turn could result in personal injury or property damages lawsuits being filed against us.\nGenerally, our oil and natural gas E&P customers agree to indemnify us against claims arising from their employees\u2019 personal injury or death to the extent that, in the case of our well site services, their employees are injured or their properties are damaged by such operations, unless, in most instances, resulting from our gross negligence or willful misconduct. Similarly, we generally agree to indemnify our E&P customers for liabilities arising from personal injury to or death of any of our employees, unless, in most instances, resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct of the E&P customer. In addition, our E&P customers generally agree to indemnify us for loss or destruction of customer-owned property or equipment and in turn, we agree to indemnify our customers for loss or destruction of property or equipment we own. Losses due to catastrophic events, such as blowouts, are generally the responsibility of the E&P customer. However, despite this general allocation of risk, we might not succeed in enforcing such contractual allocation, might incur an unforeseen liability falling outside the scope of such allocation or may be required to enter into a service\nagreement with terms that vary from the above allocations of risk. As a result, we may incur substantial losses which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough either we or our affiliates expect to maintain insurance at a level that we believe is consistent with that of similarly situated companies in our industry, we cannot guarantee that this insurance will be adequate to cover all liabilities. Further, insurance may not be generally available in the future or, if available, insurance premiums may make such insurance commercially unjustifiable.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.\nWe may sell shares of common stock in the future. We may also issue additional shares of common stock, including as employee compensation or as consideration in one or more acquisitions or other business combination transactions. As of January 31, 2021, we had outstanding approximately 8.3 million shares of our common stock. We also have registered 645,000 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under our LTIP, 340,000 registered shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan and 60,000 registered shares are reserved for issuance under our Non-Employee Directors Stock and Deferred Compensation Plan. Of those shares initially registered and reserved for issuance, as of January 31, 2021, approximately 576,700 restricted shares of common stock were granted in connection with equity awards to management, directors and employees and approximately 68,300 shares remain available for future issuance. An amendment to the LTIP was approved by stockholders on February 12, 2021 to increase the total number of shares reserved for issuance by 632,051 shares.\nSubject to the satisfaction of vesting conditions and the requirements of Rule 144, the registered restricted shares of our common stock will be available for resale immediately in the public market without restriction. With respect to shares of restricted stock granted to certain members of our management, we have filed a resale prospectus in order to allow such members of our management to freely resell their restricted stock once it has vested. In addition, (i) certain former members of our management are entitled to registration rights with respect to their shares of restricted stock, and (ii) certain former QES stockholders are entitled to registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock they received in the Merger.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition or shares held by stockholders with registration rights), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. Sales of or other transactions relating to shares of our common stock by our significant stockholders, directors, officers or employees could cause a perception in the market place that adverse events or trends have occurred or may be occurring at our company or that it is otherwise an advantageous time to sell shares of our common stock.\nWe cannot assure you that we will pay dividends on our common stock, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends. Our dividend policy will be established by our Board of Directors (the \"Board of Directors,\" or \"Board\") based on our financial condition, results of operations and capital requirements, as well as applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other business considerations that our Board considers relevant. In addition, the terms of the agreements governing our debt limit, and the terms of the agreements governing any future debt may limit or prohibit, the payments of dividends. We cannot assure you that we will pay dividends in the future or continue to pay any dividends if we do commence the payment of dividends.\nAdditionally, our indebtedness could have important consequences for holders of our common stock. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debt payment obligations, then our Board\u2019s\nability to declare dividends on our common stock will be impaired and we may be required to attempt to restructure or refinance our debt, raise additional capital or take other actions such as selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures or reducing any proposed dividends. We cannot assure you that we will be able to effect any such actions or do so on satisfactory terms, if at all, or that such actions would be permitted by the terms of our debt or our other credit and contractual arrangements.\nCertain provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, and certain provisions of Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company or other strategic transactions, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. Some of these provisions include:\n\u2022 prohibiting cumulative voting by our stockholders on all matters;\n\u2022 establishing advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the board of directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022 granting our Board the ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock; and\n\u2022 expressly authorizing our Board to adopt, alter or repeal our bylaws.\nIn addition, because we have not chosen to be exempt from Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the \"DGCL\"), this provision could also delay or effectively prevent a change of control that some stockholders may favor. In general, Section 203 provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that, together with their affiliates and associates, acquire ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation shall not engage in any \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with that corporation or its subsidiaries, including any merger or various other transactions, for a three-year period following the date on which that person became the owner of 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock.\nWe believe these provisions will protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board and by providing our Board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or effectively prevent an acquisition that our Board determines is not in the best interests of our company and our stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate courts in the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a different judicial forum for intra-corporate disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we otherwise consent in writing to selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of KLX Energy Services, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, employee or agent of KLX Energy Services to KLX Energy Services or KLX Energy Services\u2019 stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, KLX Energy Services\u2019 certificate of incorporation or the bylaws, or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a different judicial forum, including one that it may find favorable or convenient for intra-corporate disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our amended and restated bylaws inapplicable to, or\nunenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions.\nUtilizing the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and are therefore eligible to utilize certain reduced reporting and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. For as long as we are an emerging growth company, which may be up to five full fiscal years, unlike other public companies, we will not be required to, among other things: (i) provide an auditor\u2019s attestation report on management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley; (ii) comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) requiring a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer; (iii) provide certain disclosures regarding executive compensation required of larger public companies; or (iv) hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation. We will remain in an emerging growth company for up to five years, although we would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue, have more than $700 million in market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.\nWe intend to utilize certain of the reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards, until we are no longer an emerging growth company. If we were to subsequently elect instead to comply with these public company effective dates, such election would be irrevocable.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we elect to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our common stock price may be more volatile.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research reports or publish unfavorable research about our business, the price and trading volume of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our securities, the price of our securities would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to publish regular reports on us, interest in the purchase of our securities could decrease, which could cause the price of our common stock and its trading volume to decline.\nGeneral Risks\nWe may be unable to attract or retain personnel who are key to our operations.\nOur success, among other things, is dependent on our ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified senior management and other key personnel. Competition for key personnel is intense, and our ability to attract and retain key personnel is dependent on a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent. The inability to hire, develop and retain these key employees may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany key responsibilities within our business have been assigned to a small number of employees. The loss of their services could adversely affect our business. In particular, the loss of the services of one or more members of our management team, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Accounting Officer and certain of our Vice Presidents, could disrupt our operations. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies on any of our employees. As a result, we are not insured against any losses resulting from the death of our key employees.\nWe engage in transactions with related parties and such transactions present possible conflicts of interest that could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe may enter into transactions with related parties. The details of certain of these transactions are set forth in the section \u201cCertain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\u201d Related-party transactions create the possibility of conflicts of interest with regard to our management, including that:\n\u2022 we may enter into contracts between us, on the one hand, and related parties, on the other, that are not as a result of arm\u2019s-length transactions;\n\u2022 our executive officers and directors that hold positions of responsibility with related parties may be aware of certain business opportunities that are appropriate for presentation to us as well as to such other related parties and may present such business opportunities to such other parties; and\n\u2022 our executive officers and directors that hold positions of responsibility with related parties may have significant duties with, and spend significant time serving, other entities and may have conflicts of interest in allocating time.\nSuch conflicts could cause an individual in our management to seek to advance his or her economic interests or the economic interests of certain related parties above ours. Further, the appearance of conflicts of interest created by related-party transactions could impair the confidence of our investors. Our Board regularly reviews these transactions. Notwithstanding this, it is possible that a conflict of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUncertainty related to the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect the market value of our future debt obligations.\nAny borrowings under our ABL Facility will bear interest based on a base rate or a LIBOR based rate. LIBOR is calculated by reference to a market for interbank lending, and it is based on increasingly fewer actual transactions. This reduction increases the subjectivity of the LIBOR calculation process and increases the risk of manipulation. Actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies, as well as the ICE Benchmark Administration (the current LIBOR administrator), may result in changes to how LIBOR is determined or the establishment of alternative reference rates. For example, in 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. U.S. dollar LIBOR is likely to be replaced by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, but the timing of this change is unknown. SOFR is an overnight rate rather than a term rate, making it an inexact replacement for LIBOR, and there is not currently an established process for creating robust, forward-looking, SOFR term rates.\nChanging the benchmark rate for LIBOR loans from LIBOR to SOFR will require calculations of a spread. Industry organizations are attempting to structure the spread calculation in a manner that minimizes the possibility of value transfer between borrowers, lenders and contractual counterparties as a result of the switch to SOFR, but there can be no assurance that the calculated spread will be fair and accurate. We cannot predict the effect of any such changes, any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be implemented. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate our ABL Facility to determine a replacement interest rate for LIBOR with the new standard that is established. If we were unable to agree to an amendment to our ABL Facility to replace LIBOR, any borrowings under our ABL Facility would bear interest at the base rate, which has historically been higher than the LIBOR based rate. The potential effect of any such event or our future borrowing costs for any borrowings under our ABL Facility cannot yet be determined.", "PERMNO": 18048, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "KLXE"}
