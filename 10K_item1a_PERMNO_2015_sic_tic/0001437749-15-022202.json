Risk Factors\nThe foregoing business discussion and the other information included in this Form 10-K should be read in conjunction with the following risks, trends and uncertainties, any of which, either individually or in the aggregate, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nRisks Associated with The Traditional Business\nA continuing reduction in the number of residential foreclosures in California and Arizona will result in fewer trustee sale notices being published in the Company\u2019s newspapers.\nFor several years, the revenues of The Traditional Business were driven by the large number of foreclosures in California and Arizona, for which public notice advertising is required by law. The number of foreclosures continued to decline in 2015 and is expected to continue to decline in 2016. Along with improvements in the economy, the California Homeowner\u2019s Bill of Rights imposed new requirements effective January 1, 2013 that have contributed to the slowdown in foreclosures. We expect this trend to continue, and it will significantly impact the earnings of The Traditional Business because it will be impractical for the Company to offset the revenue loss with expense reductions.\nChanges in the legal requirement to publish public notice advertising or in the legal ability of our newspapers to publish those notices would have a significant adverse impact on The Traditional Business.\nFrom time to time, the legislatures in California and Arizona (and elsewhere) have considered various proposals that would result in the elimination or reduction of the amount of public notice advertising in printed newspapers required by statute. These proposals typically focus on the availability of alternative means of providing public notices, such as via the Internet. Some proposals also question the need for public notices at all. Should any of these proposals become law, particularly in California, they would materially affect the revenues of The Traditional Business.\nIn addition, if the adjudication, which is what gives publishers the legal ability to publish public notice advertising, of one or more of the Company\u2019s newspapers was challenged and revoked, those newspapers would no longer be eligible to publish public notice advertising, and it could materially affect the revenues of The Traditional Business.\nThe Traditional Business faces strong competition in each of its markets.\nCompetition for readers and advertisers is very intense, both from established publications and from new entrants into the market. The Daily Journals face aggressive competition, including amazingly low prices for multiple copy subscriptions from law-oriented newspapers in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The Company\u2019s court rules publications face competition in both Northern and Southern California from online court rules services and the courts themselves. The steady decline in recent years in the number of subscriptions to The Daily Journals and the court rule publications is likely to continue and will certainly impact The Traditional Business\u2019 future revenues.\nThe Traditional Business also competes with anywhere from one serious competitor to many competing newspapers for public notice advertising in all of its markets. As the amount of this advertising has decreased due to the reduction in the number of foreclosures discussed above, the competition to publish the remaining public notices has intensified and may result in a further decline in The Traditional Business\u2019 public notice advertising revenues.\nThe Traditional Business continues to experience challenges in maintaining its commercial advertising and circulation revenues, particularly due to the growth of Internet sites.\nInternet sites devoted to recruitment have become significant competitors of our newspapers and web sites for classified advertising. In addition, there has been a steady consolidation of companies serving the legal marketplace, resulting in an ever-smaller group of companies placing display advertising. Furthermore, newspapers like ours have been struggling to compete for display advertising generally, given the many other forums (including Internet sites) that compete for advertising dollars. These trends are expected to continue and will adversely affect The Traditional Business.\nCirculation revenues have continued to decline as more and more information has become available from the internet. Law firm mergers have also reduced the number of firms that purchase multiple subscriptions of our newspapers. It is not practical to assume that we will be able to offset the decline in subscriptions with increases in the subscription rate, and we expect that our circulation revenues will continue to decline.\nThe Traditional Business is exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in postage and paper costs.\nAfter personnel costs, postage and paper costs are typically the Company\u2019s next two largest expenses. An adequate supply of newsprint and other paper is important to the operations of The Traditional Business. The Company currently does not have a contract with any paper supplier, and in the past, shortages of newsprint have sometimes resulted in higher prices. The price of paper has remained unchanged since fiscal year 2013, and we expect it to remain unchanged at least through June 2016.\nThe Traditional Business uses the U.S. Postal Service for distribution of a majority of its newspapers and magazine. Postal rates are dependent on the operating efficiency of the U.S. Postal Service and on legislative mandates imposed upon the U.S. Postal Service. During the past several years, postal rates have increased. Postal rates and fees may increase more in the future. Further, we may not be able to pass on increases in paper and postage costs to our customers.\nRisks Associated with Journal Technologies\nThe success of Journal Technologies depends in large part on the technological update and upgrade of its software products.\nJournal Technologies\u2019 success depends on the continued improvement of its products, and the costs to update and upgrade those products consistently represent a large portion of Journal Technologies\u2019 expenses. There are many uncertainties in the process of courts and other justice agencies migrating to newer case management systems, including whether Journal Technologies\u2019 versions of these systems will find general acceptance and whether the modification of such systems can be done in a cost effective manner. The costs to update and upgrade Journal Technologies\u2019 products are expensed as incurred and will impact earnings at least through the foreseeable future.\nJournal Technologies faces significant competition from other case management software vendors.\nThere is significant competition among a limited number of companies to provide services and software to courts and other justice agencies, and some of these companies are much larger and have greater access to capital and other resources than Journal Technologies. Normally, the vendor is selected through a bidding process, and often the customers will express a preference for, or even require, larger vendors. An inability to successfully compete in this difficult market could materially affect the earnings of Journal Technologies.\nThe customers of Journal Technologies are public sector entities, which create special issues and risks.\nSubstantially all of the customers of Journal Technologies are courts, justice agencies, and other government entities. Accordingly, we face special risks associated with governmental budget constraints, especially during stressful economic times, which could force government entities to defer or forego consulting services or even stop paying their annual software license and maintenance fees. In addition, we encounter risks related to a longer and more complicated sales cycle than exists for commercial customers; political issues related to resource allocation, administration turnover and preferences for internal case management solutions or for a particular vendor; complicated bidding procedures; and fluctuations in the demand for information technology products and services.\nJournal Technologies generally recognizes revenues for software installations only upon completion of the applicable services and customer acceptance of the software system.\nIn most cases, the fees paid to Journal Technologies for installation services and software licenses are at risk until the customer has indicated its satisfaction with the installed system and it has \u201cgone live\u201d. Also, we utilize the completed contract method of accounting because the customer\u2019s acceptance is typically unpredictable and reliable estimates of the progress towards completion cannot be made. Accordingly, we do not recognize revenues for installation services or licenses or for most other consulting services until after the services have been performed, and there are significant risks associated with our ability to complete our services to the satisfaction of our customers and to fulfill the requirements that entitle us to be paid. An inability to realize payment for services performed could materially affect the earnings of Journal Technologies.\nRisks Associated with Our Holdings of Marketable Securities\nA large portion of the Company\u2019s assets is held in publicly traded securities, and the prices of those securities may decline.\nAs of September 30, 2015, the Company held marketable securities worth approximately $166,041,000, with an unrealized gain for financial statement purposes of $111,498,000. While this portfolio has enabled the Company to borrow on very favorable terms for the New Dawn and ISD acquisitions and to better compete for case management software opportunities that are usually limited to \u201clarge\u201d firms, it is unusual for a public company to invest a significant amount of its available cash in the marketable securities of other public companies. The value of these securities could decline, which would adversely affect shareholders\u2019 equity.\nAlso, as of September 30, 2015, the Company\u2019s holdings of marketable securities were concentrated in just seven companies and included two based in foreign currencies. Accordingly, a significant decline in the market value and unfavorable changes in the foreign exchange rates of one or more of the Company\u2019s holdings may not be offset by hypothetically better performance of other holdings. This concentration of risk may result in a more pronounced effect on shareholders\u2019 equity.\nIn certain circumstances, the Company may be required to recognize losses in a particular security for financial statement purposes even though the Company has not actually sold the security.\nEven if the Company\u2019s marketable securities as a whole perform extraordinarily well, for accounting reasons, an \u201cother than temporary impairment\u201d in a particular security may result in the need to recognize a loss with respect to that security in the Company\u2019s income statement in a particular period. This has happened this fiscal year and in the other two previous fiscal years prior to last year, and it may happen again in the future with respect to the same securities or other securities owned by the Company. This requirement to recognize a loss could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s earnings in a particular period. Also, at times, the Company may hold marketable securities denominated in currencies other than the United States Dollar. When it does, the Company may be at risk for significant fluctuations in the applicable foreign currency exchange rates, which would affect the profitability of such marketable securities.\nGeneral Corporate Risks\nThe Company relies heavily on the services of Gerald Salzman.\nGerald Salzman, 76, serves as the Company\u2019s president, chief executive officer, chief financial officer, treasurer and assistant secretary. He is also the president, chief executive officer, chief financial officer and secretary of Journal Technologies. If Mr. Salzman\u2019s services were no longer available to the Company, it is unlikely that the Company could find a single replacement to perform all of the duties now handled by him, and it could have a significant adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. The Company does not carry key man life insurance, nor has it entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Salzman.\nChanges in accounting guidance could have a significant effect on the Company\u2019s reported financial results.\nPreparing consolidated financial statements requires the Company\u2019s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management\u2019s application of accounting policies and the prevailing accounting guidance. The Company considers fair value measurement and disclosures, revenue recognition, accounting for software costs, accounting for business combinations, testing for goodwill and intangible impairments and income taxes to be critical accounting policies and estimates. A change in the accounting guidance with respect to one or more of these areas could materially affect the Company\u2019s reported financial results.\nWe cannot be sure that customer information and systems are fully protected against security breaches.\nJournal Technologies\u2019 software processes and stores customer information in the conduct of its business, including in some cases by utilizing a cloud-based system supplied by a third-party vendor. Despite our efforts to maintain up-to-date security controls, it is possible that our system could be improperly used to access or misappropriate customer systems or information, including personally identifiable or other confidential information. A material security breach of this nature could harm our reputation, cause us to lose current and potential customers, require us to allocate more resources to information security, or subject us or our customers to liability, resulting in increased costs, loss of revenue, or both. The Traditional Business also operates certain websites that process and, in certain cases, store customer information. A minor security breach was discovered on a website operated by The Traditional Business in early fiscal 2015, and although it was remediated, there can be no assurance that there will not be more material breaches in the future. Also, our insurance may not cover all of the costs that we may incur as a result of a material security breach.\nThe Company has identified certain material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting.\nThe Company has identified certain material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. The Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting has been designed to provide management and the Board of Directors with reasonable assurance regarding the preparation and fair presentation of the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements. As a small company, we have eight experienced employees in the accounting department and three in the IT department. Accordingly, we are not able to segregate duties to the extent we could if we had more people, and we have not sufficiently designed and documented controls that support an effective assessment of our internal controls relating to the prevention of fraud and possible management override of controls. Further, the Company does not have sufficient technical expertise in assessing and applying accounting standards to complex and/or non-routine transactions, reviewing the quarterly and annual tax analysis and provision, and assessing the adequacy of disclosures in the quarterly and annual consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe that our overall internal control environment is sufficient for a company of our size. However, the existence of material weaknesses means that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. This may result in legal, operational, financial and regulatory issues. For more information regarding the material weaknesses, the mitigating controls used by the Company and certain remedial steps being taken or considered, please see Part II.
