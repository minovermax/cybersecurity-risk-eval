{"cik": "1619250", "company": "Cleaner Yoga Mat, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS RELATING TO CLEANER YOGA MAT, INC. AND ITS BUSINESS\nLOSSES FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS MAY OCCUR AND, AS A RESULT, THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED. IF WE ARE NOT ABLE TO GROW OUR BUSINESS, THE RESULTS OF OUR OPERATIONS AND OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.\nWe are a development stage company with no operating history and may never be able to carry out our plan of operations or achieve any significant revenues or profitability. At this stage of our business, even with our good faith efforts, potential investors have a high probability of losing their entire investment.\nWe are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, and we have not generated any revenues to date. Any profitability in the future from our business will be dependent upon the successful development, marketing and sales of our proposed advertising platform and products, which are subject to numerous industry-related risk factors as set forth herein. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully carry out our plan of operations and any investor may lose their entire investment.\nKey management personnel may leave the Company, which could adversely affect the ability of the Company to continue operations.\nThe Company is entirely dependent on the efforts of our CEO and President because of the time and effort that she devotes to the Company. Without her, the Company could not exist. She is in charge of overseeing all development strategies, supervising any/all future personnel, including any consultants or contractors that we engage to assist in developing our advertising plan, and the establishment of our future sales representatives and the dealer network. The loss of her, or other key personnel in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company does not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance on its officers, directors or key employees. Our success will depend on the performance of Leisa Swanson and our ability to attract and motivate other key representatives and dealers.\nPresently, the Company\u2019s president has other outside business activities and as such is not devoting all of her time to the Company, which may result in periodic interruptions or business failure.\nOur sole officer and director, Leisa Swanson, has other outside business activities; however, she is committed to devoting approximately 30 hours per week to our operations. Our operations may be sporadic and occur at times when Leisa Swanson is unavailable, which may lead to the periodic interruption in the implementation of our business plan. Such delays could have a significant negative effect on the success of the business.\nThe lack of public company experience of our sole officer and director could adversely impact our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of U.S. securities laws.\nOur sole officer and director, Leisa Swanson lacks public company experience, which could impair our ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements such as those imposed by Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. She has never been responsible for managing a publicly traded company and she has had limited experience with accounting and financial matters. As the sole officer and director of a public company, Leisa Swanson\u2019s responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and making required disclosures on a timely basis. Leisa Swanson may not be able to implement programs and policies in an effective and timely manner that adequately respond to such increased legal, regulatory compliance and reporting requirements, including establishing and maintaining internal controls over financial reporting.\nAdditionally, Leisa Swanson\u2019s limited financial and accounting experience may affect her ability to develop effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Any such deficiencies, weaknesses or lack of compliance could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which is necessary to maintain our public company status. If we were to fail to fulfill those obligations, our ability to continue as a U.S. public company would be in jeopardy in which event investors could lose their entire investment in our Company.\nThe fitness studio industry is relatively new, and has experienced rapid growth over a short period of time, and it is uncertain whether this market will continue to develop or whether it can be maintained. If we are unable to successfully respond to changes in the market, our business could be harmed.\nThe industry in which we intend to operate has grown rapidly as Yoga and Pilates studios have continued to open across the world, and gyms have started to offer Yoga and Pilates in their facilities. Given the limited history of this industry, it is difficult to predict whether this market will continue to grow or whether it can be maintained. Additionally, we expect that the market will evolve in ways that may be difficult to predict. For example, we anticipate that over time we will reach a point in most markets where we have achieved a market penetration such that investments in new users are less productive and the continued growth of our gross profit will require more focus on increasing the rate at which new participants to Yoga and Pilates purchase our products. It is also possible that distributors or customers could broadly determine that they no longer believe in the value of our proposed products. In the event of these or any other changes to the market, our success will depend on our ability to successfully adjust our strategy to meet the changing market dynamics. If we are unable to do so, our business could be harmed and our results of operations subject to a material negative impact.\nWe have a rapidly evolving business model and our proposed products could fail to attract or retain customers or generate revenue.\nBecause we are a new company, and have less then one year of operations, we have a rapidly evolving business model and are regularly exploring the development of our proposed target consumer and the introduction of our proposed products with respect to which we may have limited experience. In addition, our potential dealer network and individual clients may not respond favorably to our products once launched. If products we introduce fail to engage customers or dealers, we may fail to acquire or retain enough business or generate sufficient revenue or other value to justify our investment, and our business may be materially and adversely affected. Our ability to retain or increase our user base and revenue will depend heavily on our ability to innovate and to create successful products and market them so as the customer is convinced of their necessity.\nOur distributor network is not based on material contracts.\nOur distributor network was developed through cold calling and emailing derived from simple Internet searches. We have no way to ensure that we are legally protected against members of the distribution network. We have no exclusivity, no guarantees or requirements, pre orders, or other contractual mechanisms that will ensure the distributor\u2019s actions will benefit the Company. Further, we have no contractual protection for indemnification or other contractual mechanisms to limit the liabilities of the Company from distributors or their customers.\nIf we fail to acquire distributors and end-users to use and purchase our proposed products, our business will be harmed.\nWe must acquire distributors and end-users that purchase and use our proposed products in order to generate revenue and achieve profitability. We cannot assure you that the revenue or gross profit from any end-users or distributors we may acquire will ultimately exceed the cost involved with acquiring new users and distributors. If consumers do not perceive our offers to be of high value and quality, we may not be able to acquire or retain users and distributors.\nWe believe that many of our new users will originate from word-of-mouth and other non-paid referrals from existing users; therefore, we must ensure that our existing users remain loyal to our product in order to continue receiving those referrals. Once we establish a user base, if our efforts to satisfy our established users are not successful, we may not be able to acquire new users in sufficient numbers to continue to grow our business or we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenses in order to acquire new users. Further, we believe that the level of communication and sharing among users will influence our success. If the level of usage by our user base declines or does not grow as expected, we may suffer a decline in user growth. A significant decrease in the level of usage or user growth would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to maintain favorable terms with our distributors, our expected gross profit may be adversely affected.\nThe success of our business depends in part on our ability to retain and increase the number of distributors who sell our products. When a distributor offers our product to end-users, the distributor must see a significant return on their investment. If distributors decide that utilizing our products does not provide a substantial profit, they may discontinue distribution. This would adversely affect our gross profit.\nIf our distributors do not meet the needs and expectations of our end-user customers, our business could suffer.\nCurrently, we have 44 distributors in the United States, as well as 5 International distributors in Croatia, England, Italy, and the Netherlands. However, our business will depend on a reputation for providing high-quality effective sanitization products to customers, and our brand and reputation may be harmed by actions taken by distributors that are outside our control. Any shortcomings of one or more of our distributors, particularly with respect to an issue affecting the quality of the products, may be attributed by our end-user to us, thus damaging our reputation, brand value and potentially affecting our results of operations. In addition, negative publicity and end-user sentiment generated as a result of fraudulent or deceptive conduct by our distributors could damage our reputation, reduce our ability to attract new users or retain our current users, and diminish the value of our brand.\nOur business is competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.\nThe market for yoga mat and fitness equipment sanitization is competitive. If Competition chooses to create a similar product to our device it may result in pricing pressures, reduced profit margins or lost market share or a failure to grow our market share, any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations. We compete directly against wholesalers and direct retailers. We also face competition from wholesalers and direct retailers of traditional general use UV devices. Many of our competitors are large companies with stronger brand. Because of the nature of the UV light being a relatively new product for consumers, we also compete with other UV-C light manufacturers. Many of our competitors have significant competitive advantages, including longer operating histories, larger and broader customer bases, more established relationships with a broader set of suppliers, greater brand recognition and greater financial, research and development, store development, marketing, distribution and other resources than we do.\nOur competitors may be able to achieve and maintain brand awareness and market share more quickly and effectively than we can. In contrast to our \u201cgrassroots\u201d marketing approach, many of our competitors promote their brands primarily through traditional forms of advertising, such as print media and television commercials, and through celebrity athlete endorsements, and have substantial resources to devote to such efforts. Our competitors may also create and maintain brand awareness using traditional forms of advertising more quickly in new markets than we can. Our competitors may also be able to increase sales in their new and existing markets faster than we do by emphasizing different distribution channels than we do, such as catalog sales or an extensive franchise network, as opposed to distribution through retail stores, wholesale or internet, and many of our competitors have substantial resources to devote toward increasing sales in such ways.\nIn addition, because we own no patents or exclusive intellectual property rights in the technology underlying our products, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products similar to our products.\nWe sell merchandise over the Internet through our e-commerce website www.CleanerYogaMat.com. Our e-commerce operations, included in our direct to consumer channel, are subject to numerous risks, including reliance on third party computer hardware and software, rapid technological change, diversion of sales from our stores, liability for online content, violations of state or federal laws, including those relating to online privacy, credit card fraud, risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate our websites and their related support systems, including computer viruses, telecommunications failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. There is no assurance that our e-commerce operations will continue to achieve sales and profitability growth.\nWe anticipate that most, if not all, of our competitors will have greater name and brand recognition and access to greater amounts of capital and established relationships with a larger base of current and potential customers. Because of their size and bargaining power, our competitors may be able to purchase products at lower prices than us in the initial stages of our development. As a result, our operations may be significantly and negatively impacted by our larger, more established competitors.\nOur right to sell the CYM wand, or any ancillary products is not exclusive, nor have we obligated any of our distributors to exclusivity in sales of CYM wand, ancillary products, or similar products. As such, our business model could be severely compromised if our manufacturer chooses to deliver products to our competitors who maybe better positioned to sale large lots. Moreover, our distribution network could be compromised by the offerings and sales of CYM products through other distributors or products directly competing with our CYM wand. Our distributors are not incentivized otherwise to ensure that our products are strategically placed with priority in store or in marketing and sales materials disseminated by our distributor network.\nWe cannot assure that we will be able to manage the growth of our Company effectively.\nWe plan to experience rapid growth in demand for our products once we are able to launch our proposed platform. We expect our number of employees and number of customers to increase significantly once we launch our marketing plan, and we expect our growth to continue for the foreseeable future. The growth and expansion of our product offerings could place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial resources. We will need to manage multiple relations with various distributors, customers, and other third parties. To effectively manage our growth, we will need to continually implement operational plans and strategies, improve and expand our infrastructure of people and information systems, and train and manage our employee base.\nOur business will depend on our ability to maintain and scale the network infrastructure necessary to operate our advertising platform, website and future application; and any significant disruption in service on our website or applications could result in a loss of customers.\nDistributors and customers will access our order page through our website. Our reputation and ability to acquire, retain and serve our customers will be dependent upon the reliable performance of our website and PayPal, our cart solution. Issues within these our website or PayPal service provider, whether due to system failures, computer viruses or physical or electronic break-ins, could affect the security or availability of our website, and prevent our customers from accessing our buy page. Third-party providers will host our network. Any disruption in these services or any failure of these providers to handle traffic could significantly harm our business.\nOur business may be subject to seasonal sales fluctuations that could result in volatility or have an adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock.\nOur business, like that of our potential distributors, may be subject to some degree of sales seasonality. As we grow our Company, these seasonal fluctuations may become more evident. Seasonality may cause our working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter depending on the variability in the volume and timing of sales. These factors, among other things, make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect our ability to manage working capital and to predict financial results accurately, which could adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe will be subject to payments-related risks.\nWe plan to accept payments using PayPal, including credit card, debit card or PayPal account. As we offer new payment options to consumers, we may be subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements and fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we will pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We will rely on third parties to provide payment-processing services, including the processing of credit cards and debit cards and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We will also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nLimited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital.\nThere is no pertinent historical financial information for the Company upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. Our assets and business have not yet generated substantial or recurring revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services. We will require additional financing to cover costs that we expect to incur over the next twelve months. We believe that debt financing will not be an alternative for funding our operations as we do not have tangible assets to secure any debt financing. We anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock or other securities. However, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock to fund our plan of operations. In the absence of such financing, we will not be able to continue and our business plan will fail.\nOur common stock is subject to the \"penny stock\" rules of the SEC and the trading market in our securities is limited, which makes transactions in our stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our stock.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted certain rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) that are applicable to \u201cpenny stocks\u201d. For the purposes relevant to us, a \u201cpenny stock\u201d is any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or has an exercise or conversion price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require:\n\u00b7\nthat a broker or dealer approve a person\u2019s account for transaction in penny stocks;\n\u00b7\nthe broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting for the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased; and\n\u00b7\nthat a broker or dealer provide certain detailed market information about the market for the applicable company\u2019s securities.\nIn order to approve a person\u2019s account for transaction involving penny stocks, the broker or dealer must:\n(1)\nobtain financial information, investment experience and investment objectives of the person; and\n(2) make a reasonable determination that the proposed transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and that the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\n\u2028\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form:\n\u00b7\nsets forth on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and\n\u00b7\nthat the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.\nFollowing a transaction, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nGenerally, brokers may be less willing to execute transaction in securities subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and depress the market value of our stock.\nThere are additional risks of investing in penny stocks whether in public offerings or in secondary trading, relating to commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions.", "PERMNO": 16647, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "VLRXQ"}
