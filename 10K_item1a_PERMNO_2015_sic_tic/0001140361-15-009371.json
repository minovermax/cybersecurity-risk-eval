The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know, or that we currently view as immaterial, may also impair our business operations.\nThis Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our results could materially differ from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere. See \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe have a history of significant operating losses.\nWe have incurred annual operating losses each year since our inception in 1992. Although we achieved operating profitability on a quarterly basis in the second quarter of 2012, we have not been able to sustain this and achieve quarterly or annual operating profitability since then. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $284.0 million. To date, we have funded our operations principally through the public and private sales of our stock, from borrowings under our credit facilities, from product and service revenue, and from development funding. We will need to generate significant additional revenue while maintaining our current margins to achieve annual profitability, and we cannot assure you that we will ever realize such revenue levels or achieve profitability on a consistent basis.\nIf our revenues do not meet our expectations, our costs exceed our estimates, or our working capital needs are greater than anticipated, we may not have adequate liquidity to continue operating our business. Our cash requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 future sales growth;\n\u00b7 the demand for our products;\n\u00b7 the gross profit we are able to generate from our sales;\n\u00b7 the timing, level, and extent of our research and development funding;\n\u00b7 the rate of expansion of our sales and marketing activities;\n\u00b7 the rate of expansion of our manufacturing processes;\n\u00b7 our overall level of operating expenses;\n\u00b7 the payment terms we negotiate with our suppliers; and\n\u00b7 our default rates on receivables.\nA substantial increase in sales of our MIS solutions or a substantial increase in UPS sales may materially impact the amount of working capital required to fund our operations. In order to increase our MIS sales, we may be required to make larger investments in inventory and to increase the amount of our outstanding receivables. These larger investments may require us to obtain additional sources of working capital, debt, or equity financing in order to fund our business. Even if we obtain additional debt financing, a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness.\nA significant increase in sales of our MIS products may materially increase the amount of working capital required to fund our operations.\nBecause of the significant up-front investment required, and the longer period between order and delivery relative to our UPS products, a significant increase in sales of our MIS products may materially increase the amount of working capital required to fund our operations. The amount of time between the receipt of payment from our customers and our expenditures for raw materials, manufacturing, and shipment of products (the cash cycle) for MIS sales can be as much as 210 days, depending on customer payment terms. If we experience a substantial increase in the size or number of MIS orders, we may need to obtain additional sources of working capital, debt, or equity financing to fund the business. If we are unsuccessful at obtaining additional sources of working capital, we may be required to curtail our level of MIS sales or we may lose potential customers, either of which may adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe may need additional capital in the future, and it may not be available to us on favorable terms, or at all.\nWe have historically relied on outside financing and cash flow from operations to fund our operating losses, operations, capital expenditures, and expansion. We may require additional capital from equity or debt financing in the future to fund our operations or respond to competitive pressures or strategic opportunities. We may not be able to secure timely additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. The terms of any additional financing may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, if and when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. We do not know whether we will be able to secure additional funding, or funding on terms acceptable to us, to continue our operations as planned. If financing is not available, we may be required to reduce, delay, or eliminate certain activities or to license or sell to others some of our proprietary technology.\nOur reliance on large and complex system solutions and customer concentration may adversely affect our ability to accurately predict the timing of revenues and to meet short-term expectations of operating results.\nOur reliance on large and complex system solutions means that we must devote substantial effort and time to complete sales to customers. Further, a large portion of our quarterly revenue is derived from relatively few large transactions with relatively few customers. For example, in 2014 and 2013, our three largest customers contributed 30% and 45% of our revenue, respectively. Any delay in completing these large sales transactions or any reduction in the number of customers or large transactions, may result in significant adverse fluctuations in our quarterly revenue. Further, we use anticipated revenues to establish our operating budgets and a large portion of our expenses, particularly rent and salaries are fixed in the short term. As a result, any shortfall or delay in revenue could result in increased losses and would likely cause our operating results to be below public expectations. The occurrence of any of these events would likely materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business may be affected by general economic conditions and uncertainty that may cause customers to defer or cancel sales commitments previously made to us.\nAny future economic uncertainty in the United States or certain international markets may lead to an economic recession or lower capital spending and credit availability in some or all of the markets in which we operate. A recession or even the risk of a potential recession or uneven economic growth conditions may be sufficient reason for customers to delay, defer, or cancel purchase decisions, including decisions previously made. This risk is magnified for capital goods purchases such as UPS and MIS products that we supply. Although we believe that our competitive advantage and our efforts to broaden the number of different markets in which we sell may help mitigate the economic risk associated with any one country or market vertical, any customer delays or cancellation in sales orders could materially adversely affect our level of revenues and operating results.\nOur business could be impacted by customer credit risk on receivables.\nMost of our sales are on an open credit basis. Our failure to collect receivables from any of our customers in a timely manner could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity. The collection risk may potentially increase if we sell a higher proportion of MIS, such as our CleanSource PowerHouse products, due to their higher average selling price. If future actual default rates on receivables differ from those currently anticipated, our working capital could decrease and we may not have adequate liquidity to continue operating our business.\nOur financial results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter.\nOur product revenue, operating expenses, and quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, you should not rely on our operating results during any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance in any quarterly period or fiscal year. The factors which may affect our business include, among others:\n\u00b7 timing of orders from our customers and the possibility that customers may change their order requirements with little or no notice to us;\n\u00b7 demand for of our flywheel-based energy storage system as an alternative to lead-acid batteries and our continuous power and infrastructure solutions;\n\u00b7 ongoing need for short-term power outage protection in traditional UPS systems;\n\u00b7 deferral of customer orders in anticipation of new products from us or other providers of power quality systems;\n\u00b7 our order backlog may not increase and does not always result in revenue;\n\u00b7 limited visibility into customer spending plans;\n\u00b7 timing of deferred revenue components associated with large orders;\n\u00b7 ability to manage capital requirements associated with large orders;\n\u00b7 timing and execution of our new product introductions;\n\u00b7 new product releases, licensing, or pricing decisions by our competitors;\n\u00b7 commodity and raw material component prices;\n\u00b7 ability to adjust our cost structure in response to reductions in income;\n\u00b7 loss of a significant customer or distributor;\n\u00b7 impact of changes to our product distribution strategy and pricing policies;\n\u00b7 failure to achieve our anticipated revenue growth rate;\n\u00b7 impact of changes to our product distribution strategy and pricing policies of our distributors;\n\u00b7 changes in product mix;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7 changes in the mix of domestic and international sales;\n\u00b7 rate of market growth for our products; and\n\u00b7 acceptance of our latest generation UPS product in the marketplace.\nThe market for power quality products is evolving and it is difficult to predict its potential size or future growth rate. Most of the organizations that may purchase our products have invested substantial resources in their existing power systems and, as a result, have been reluctant or slow to adopt a new technology, particularly during a period of reduced capital expenditures. Moreover, our current products are alternatives to traditional battery-based UPS systems and may never be accepted by our customers or may be made obsolete by other advances in power quality technologies.\nSignificant portions of our expenses are not variable in the short term and cannot be quickly reduced to respond to decreases in revenue. Therefore, if our revenue is below our expectations, our operating results are likely to be adversely and disproportionately affected. In addition, we may change our prices; modify our distribution strategy and policies; accelerate our investment in research and development; or shift our sales and marketing efforts in response to competitive pressures or to pursue new market opportunities. Any one of these activities may further limit our ability to adjust spending in response to revenue fluctuations. We use forecasted revenue to establish our expense budget. Because most of our expenses are fixed in the short term or incurred in advance of anticipated revenue, any shortfall in revenue may result in significant losses.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from international markets and plan to continue to expand such efforts, which subjects us to additional business risks including increased logistical and financial complexity, managing internal controls and processes, political instability, and currency fluctuations.\nThe percentage of our total revenue derived from customers located outside of North America was 42%, 20%, and 40% in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. Our international operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7 foreign laws and business practices that favor local competition;\n\u00b7 dependence on local channel partners;\n\u00b7 compliance with multiple, conflicting, and changing government laws and regulations;\n\u00b7 longer cash cycles;\n\u00b7 difficulties in managing and staffing foreign operations;\n\u00b7 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and the associated effects on product demand and timing of payment;\n\u00b7 political and economic stability, particularly in the Middle East and Africa;\n\u00b7 greater difficulty in the contracting and shipping process and in accounts receivable collection including longer collection periods;\n\u00b7 ability to fund working capital requirements;\n\u00b7 greater difficulty in hiring qualified technical sales and application engineers; and\n\u00b7 difficulties with financial reporting in foreign countries.\nTo date, the majority of our sales to international customers and purchases of components from international suppliers have been denominated in U.S. dollars, Euros, and British Pounds. All of our UPS products are manufactured in the U.S. and then sold to our foreign subsidiaries and customers, normally in U.S. dollars. An increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive for our international customers to purchase, thus rendering our products less competitive. We also source the non-UPS components for our modular power infrastructure products locally where possible and pay for these components in local currencies as a way to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in foreign currencies and lessen the impact of any unfavorable fluctuations with the U.S. dollar. We and many of our subsidiaries sell products outside of the country of incorporation, and often in foreign currencies. To the extent we record sales in other than our local currency; this can result in translation gains and losses. Currently, we do not engage in hedging activities for our international operations to offset this currency risk. However, we may engage in hedging activities in the future.\nWe are subject to risks relating to product concentration and lack of revenue diversification.\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a limited number of products, particularly from our CleanSource 300/250 Series UPS product family. These UPS products are also an integral component of our CleanSource PowerHouse products. We expect these products to continue to account for a large percentage of our revenues in the near term. Continued market acceptance of these products is therefore critical to our future success.\nOur future success will also depend on our ability to reduce our dependence on these few products by developing and introducing new products and product or feature enhancements in a timely manner. Specifically, our ability to capture significant market share depends on our ability to develop and market extensions to our existing product lines at higher and lower power range offerings and as containerized solutions. We are currently investing significant amounts in our UPS and MIS products to broaden our product portfolio. Even if we are able to develop and commercially introduce new products and enhancements, they may not achieve market acceptance and the revenue generated from these new products and enhancements may not offset the costs, which would substantially impair our revenue, profitability, and overall financial prospects. Successful product development and market acceptance of our existing and future products depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 changing requirements of customers;\n\u00b7 accurate prediction of market and technical requirements;\n\u00b7 timely completion and introduction of new designs;\n\u00b7 quality, price, and performance of our products;\n\u00b7 availability, quality, price, and performance of competing products and technologies;\n\u00b7 our customer service and support capabilities and responsiveness;\n\u00b7 successful development of our relationships with existing and potential customers; and\n\u00b7 changes in technology, industry standards, or end-user preferences.\nWe must expand our distribution channels and manage our existing and new product distribution relationships to grow our business.\nThe future growth of our business will depend on our ability to expand our existing relationships with distributors; to identify and develop additional channels for the distribution and sale of our products; and to manage these relationships. As part of our growth strategy, we may expand our relationships with distributors and develop relationships with new distributors. We will also look to identify and develop new relationships with additional third parties that could serve as outlets for our products, or provide additional opportunities for our existing sales channels, such as the relationships we have developed with IT hardware manufacturers such as HP. Our inability to execute this strategy successfully and to integrate and manage our existing OEM channel partners and our new distributors and manufacturer\u2019s representatives would likely impede our future growth.\nOur backlog may not result in revenue.\nOur backlog is not necessarily a meaningful predictor of future results. Backlog represents anticipated revenue from unfulfilled product orders and from service work not yet performed under signed contracts. Due to possible changes in product delivery schedules and the potential for cancellation of unfulfilled product orders and service contracts by our customers, our backlog at any particular date should not be relied upon as being indicative of revenue for any succeeding period. Time periods from receipt of an order to shipment date and installation vary widely, and may be determined by a number of factors, including the terms of the customer contract and the customer\u2019s deployment plan. The value of service contracts included in backlog could cover services extending one or more years into the future. The size of an order or the scope of a service contract can be reduced significantly during the course of a project. If the scope of an order or contract is revised or an order or contract is cancelled, we adjust backlog accordingly. Also, some of the orders we accept from customers require certain conditions or contingencies to be satisfied prior to shipment or prior to commissioning or installation, some of which are outside of our control and some of which may not be satisfied. For these and other reasons, we may not fully realize our entire backlog as revenue.\nWe must continue to hire and retain skilled personnel.\nWe believe our future success will depend upon our ability to attract, motivate, and retain highly skilled managerial, engineering, sales, and product marketing personnel. There is a limited supply of skilled employees in the power quality marketplace. Our small size relative to our competitors, our history of significant operating losses and our lack of brand equity, particularly in foreign markets, makes it very difficult for us to attract new personnel. If we are unable to attract the new personnel we desire, retain personnel we currently employ, or if we are unable to replace departing employees quickly, our operations and new product development may suffer.\nWe are significantly dependent on our relationships with Caterpillar and Hewlett Packard. If these relationships are unsuccessful, for whatever reason, our business and financial prospects would likely suffer.\nCaterpillar, together with its dealer network, is our primary OEM customer and the single largest customer for our flywheel-based UPS products. Caterpillar accounted for 18%, 14%, and 13% of our revenue in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. HP is our largest IT channel partner and accounted for 1%, 22%, and 35% of our revenue in 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. A number of factors could cause these customers to cancel or defer orders, including interruptions to their operations due to a downturn in their industries; delays or changes in their product offerings; securing other sources for the products we manufacture; or developing such products internally. If our relationships with Caterpillar or HP are not successful or suffer a material adverse change, such as a material reduction in the level of orders due to an inability to win customer projects or other factors outside of our control; or their failure to pay us on a timely basis, our business and operating results would suffer unless we are able to replace these revenues from another source or sources in a timely manner.\nWe have underutilized manufacturing capacity and have no experience manufacturing our products in large quantities.\nIn 2001, we leased and equipped a 127,000 square foot facility used for manufacturing and testing of our three-phase product line, including our UPS and energy storage products. To be financially successful and to fully utilize the capacity of our facility and allocate its associated overhead, we must achieve significantly higher sales volumes. We must accomplish this while also preserving the quality levels we achieved when manufacturing these products in more limited quantities. To date, we have not been successful at increasing our sales volume to a level that fully utilizes the capacity of the facility and we may never increase our sales volume to necessary levels. If we do not reach these necessary sales volume levels, or if we cannot sell our products at our suggested prices, our ability to reach profitability on a quarterly or annual basis would be adversely impacted.\nAchieving the necessary production levels to absorb the capacity of our manufacturing facility efficiently presents a number of technological and engineering challenges for us. We have not previously manufactured our products in high volume. We do not know whether or when we will be able to develop efficient, low-cost manufacturing capability and processes that will enable us to meet the quality, price, engineering, design, and product standards or production volumes required to manufacture large quantities of our products successfully. Even if we are successful in developing our manufacturing capability and processes, we do not know whether we will do so in time to meet our product commercialization objectives or to satisfy the requirements of our customers.\nWe must build quality products to ensure acceptance of our products.\nThe market perception of our products and related acceptance of such products is highly dependent upon the quality and reliability of the products we build. Any quality problems attributable to our UPS or MIS product lines may substantially impair our revenue and operating results. Moreover, quality problems for our product lines could cause us to delay or cease shipments of products or have to recall or field upgrade products, thus adversely affecting our ability to meet revenue or cost targets. In addition, while we seek to limit our liability as a result of product failure or defects through warranty and other limitations, if one of our products fails, a customer could suffer a significant loss and seek to hold us responsible for that loss and our reputation with other current or potential customers would likely suffer.\nSeasonality may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results.\nHistorically, our business has experienced seasonal customer buying patterns. In recent years, our business has generally experienced relatively weaker demand in the first calendar quarter of the year. We believe this pattern, which we attribute to annual capital budgeting procedures, may possibly continue. In addition, we anticipate demand for our products in Europe may decline in the summer months, compared to other regions, because of reduced corporate buying patterns during the vacation season.\nWe depend on sole and limited source suppliers and outsource selected component manufacturing.\nWe purchase some of our critical component parts from sole source and limited source suppliers. If our suppliers receive excess demand for their products, we may receive a low priority for order fulfillment as large volume customers may receive priority that may result in delays in our acquiring components. A delay in acquiring components for our products may delay the manufacture and shipment of our products. Some of these delays may be substantial. As a result, we may purchase critical long-lead time or single-sourced components in large quantities to help protect our ability to deliver finished products on time. If we overestimate our component requirements, we may have excess inventory, which will increase our costs. If we underestimate our component requirements, we will have inadequate inventory, which will delay our manufacturing and render us unable to deliver products to customers on scheduled delivery dates. If we are unable to obtain a component from a supplier or if the price of a component has increased substantially, we may be required to manufacture the component internally, which will also result in delays or we may be required to absorb price increases. Manufacturing delays could negatively impact our ability to sell our products and could damage our customer relationships.\nTo assure the availability of our products to our customers, we outsource the manufacturing of selected components prior to the receipt of purchase orders from customers based on their forecasts of their product needs and internal product sales revenue forecasts. However, these forecasts do not represent binding purchase commitments from our customers. We do not recognize revenue for such products until we receive an order from the customer and the product is shipped to the customer. As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated revenue. As demand for our products may not materialize, this product delivery method subjects us to increased risks of high inventory carrying costs, obsolescence and excess, and may increase our operating costs. In addition, we may from time to time make design changes to our products, which could lead to obsolescence of inventory.\nOur manufacturing operations are concentrated in a small number of nearby facilities.\nAll of our UPS systems and our MIS products for customers in the Americas are manufactured in our Austin, Texas facility. Our manufacturing, research and development, and administrative activities are concentrated in two nearby facilities. If, for any reason, including as a result of a natural disaster, act of terrorism, or other similar event, either of these facilities should be damaged or destroyed or become inoperable or inaccessible, our ability to conduct our business could be adversely affected or interrupted entirely.\nWe face significant competition from other companies.\nThe markets for power quality and power reliability systems are intensely competitive. There are many companies engaged in all areas of traditional and alternative UPS and backup power systems in the U.S. and abroad, including, among others, major electric and specialized electronics firms, as well as universities, research institutions, and foreign government-sponsored companies. There are many companies that are developing flywheel-based energy storage systems and flywheel-based power quality systems. We may face future competition from companies that are developing other types of emerging power technologies, such as advanced new battery chemistries, high-speed composite flywheels, ultra capacitors, and superconducting magnetic energy storage.\nMany of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, service, marketing, and other resources, broader name and brand recognition, and a larger installed base of customers. As a result, these competitors may have greater credibility with our existing and potential customers and greater service infrastructure than we do. Given our current production volumes and lack of strategic supplier management programs, we may receive less favorable pricing from our suppliers than some of our larger competitors. Our competitors may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products than we can, which would allow them to respond more quickly than us to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements.\nIn addition, some of our current and potential competitors have established supplier or joint development relationships with our current or potential customers. These competitors may be able to use their existing relationships to discourage these customers from purchasing products from us or to persuade them to replace our products with their products. Increased competition could decrease our prices, reduce our sales, lower our margins, or decrease our market share. These and other competitive pressures could prevent us from competing successfully against current or future competitors and could materially harm our business.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights.\nWe expect future technological advancements made by us will be critical to achieving and sustaining market acceptance of our products. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, and business partners and control access to and distribution of our software, documentation, and other proprietary information.\nDespite these efforts, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. Monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and we cannot be certain the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology, particularly in foreign countries where applicable laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the U.S. In addition, the measures we undertake may not be sufficient to protect our proprietary technology adequately and may not preclude competitors from independently developing products with functionality or features similar to those of our products. We believe that our success depends more on the knowledge, passion, experience and technological expertise of our employees than on the legal protection that our patents and other proprietary rights might afford.\nWe may be subject to claims by others that we infringe on their proprietary technology.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation in the U.S. involving patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights. We may become involved in litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or defend allegations of infringement asserted by others. Legal proceedings could subject us to significant liability for damages or invalidate our intellectual property rights. Any litigation, regardless of its merits or its outcome, would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management\u2019s time and attention. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to take specific actions, including:\n\u00b7 cease selling our products that use the challenged intellectual property;\n\u00b7 obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology or trademark, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u00b7 redesign those products that use infringing intellectual property; or\n\u00b7 cease to use an infringing trademark.\nOur involvement in any such litigation may cause us to incur unexpected litigation costs, require modifications to or limit our ability to sell our products, and adversely impact our business and reputation.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations.\nPursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to provide a report by management on our internal control over financial reporting, including management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nA material weakness or other control deficiency could result in errors in our reported results and could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nA material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. In 2013, our management identified a material weakness resulting from control deficiencies related to our credit approval process whereby we did not confirm information from an employee of ours in China regarding the facts surrounding Qiyuan, a distributor with which we entered into a distribution agreement.\nIn response to such material weakness, management implemented additional credit approval process procedures including actions to further verify the financial condition and ownership structure of all new customers. The material weakness was remediated as of December 31, 2013. Any further material weakness or unsuccessful remediation could adversely impact investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements. As a result, our ability to obtain any additional financing could be materially and adversely affected, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition. In addition, perceptions of us among customers, lenders, investors, securities analysts, and others could also be adversely affected. We can give no assurances the measures we have taken to date, or any future measures we may take, will prevent or remediate any additional material weaknesses in the future.\nOur pending legal matters have increased our costs and could result in fines and penalties.\nWe are involved in ongoing legal matters as described in the section below titled \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d These matters may harm our business and liquidity in the future. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial expenses for legal and accounting services related to such matters. These matters have also required significant time and attention from our management. At this point, we remain unable to predict the duration, scope, or results of the pending SEC investigation. In connection with our pending legal matters, including any further litigation that may be pursued, we may incur defense costs that may exceed our insurance coverage. We may also incur costs if the insurers of our directors and officers and our liability insurers deny coverage for the costs and expenses related to any litigation. Adverse outcomes or other developments during the course of such matters may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operation.\nGlobal cybersecurity threats can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats. While we employ comprehensive measures to prevent, detect, address, and mitigate these threats (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks, and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems), cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption, or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage; litigation with third parties; diminution in the value of our investment in research; development and engineering; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs; which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.\nTax matters could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to potential income tax and other taxes in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by the amount of income we have in various jurisdictions and the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for products, services, funding, and other items. We are subject to periodic tax audits in the United States and in other various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing, or other matters and assess additional taxes. We assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the need for and adequacy of a provision for income taxes. However, the outcomes from these examinations could have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability. In addition, our income taxes and other tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by numerous factors including changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nWe have anti-takeover provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent our acquisition.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of discouraging, delaying, or preventing a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable. We also are subject to the anti-takeover laws of the State of Delaware, which may further discourage, delay, or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us. In addition, our agreement with Caterpillar for the distribution of UPS products provides that Caterpillar may terminate the agreement in the event we are acquired or undergo a change in control. The possible loss of a significant customer could be a significant deterrent to possible acquirers and may substantially limit the number of possible acquirers. All of these factors may decrease the likelihood we would be acquired, which may depress the market price of our common stock.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile and is likely to be volatile in the future.\nHistorically, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly. In 2014, the sales price of our common stock ranged from $1.63 to $3.67 per share.
