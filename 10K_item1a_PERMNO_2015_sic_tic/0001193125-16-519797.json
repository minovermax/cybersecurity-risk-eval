{"cik": "1089511", "company": "ALASKA COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe face a variety of risks that may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, some of which are beyond our control. The risks described below are not the only ones we face and should be considered in addition to the other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere and the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the SEC, including our subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business. If any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nCompetition\nThe telecommunications industry in Alaska is competitive and creates pressure on our pricing and customer retention efforts.\nStrong competitors make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers, which could result in lower revenue, cash flow from operating activities and Free Cash Flow.\nOur principal facilities-based competitor for voice and broadband services is GCI, who is also the dominant cable television provider in Alaska. In the business and wholesale market, GCI holds a dominant position through its extensive fiber optic, microwave and satellite based middle mile network as well as its undersea fiber cable network, where it owns and operates two of the four existing undersea fiber optic cables connecting Alaska to the contiguous states. In the consumer market, GCI bundles its cable video services with voice, broadband and wireless services. We do not offer video service and wireless, and thus, are unable to offer competing bundles.\nGCI continues to expand its statewide reach, including through its Terra Southwest project which is funded with federal subsidies, consisting of grants from the USDA Rural Utilities Service and federal low-interest loans. This subsidy gives GCI a substantial competitive advantage in the markets served by Terra Southwest, and GCI receives substantial additional funding for services offered over this facility from the federal E-Rate and Rural Health Care universal service support mechanisms. GCI has indicated it intends to replicate this government subsidized model in other markets in Alaska, which will create monopoly-type conditions in these markets which are subject to minimal regulatory oversight.\nWith a long history of operating in Alaska, AT&T has a terrestrial long-haul network in Alaska where the focus is on serving certain national customers. AT&T\u2019s primary focus in Alaska is providing wireless services.\nAs we compete more extensively in the managed IT services business, we are likely to face new competition, both local and national. An example of this new competition is World Wide Technologies, a large equipment value add reseller. There are many smaller firms that compete for IT business in Alaska. We believe that competition for managed IT services is fragmented in Alaska with no clear or dominant provider.\nOur New Cost Structure\nWe may not be able to maintain our new cost structure following the Wireless Sale which would create risk to our ability to generate bottom-line growth.\nSubsequent to the Wireless Sale, wind-down of our wireless operations and positioning the Company as a more focused broadband and managed IT services company, we commenced a plan to generate synergies and achieve cost reductions. This plan was substantially implemented during the third and fourth quarters of 2015. Maintaining these cost reductions is a critical factor impacting our generation of cash flow from operating activities. If we fail to maintain these cost reductions, our financial condition will be impacted.\nTechnological Advancements and Changes in Telecommunications Standards\nIf we do not adapt to rapid technological advancements and changes in telecommunications standards, our ability to compete could be strained, and as a result, we would lose customers.\nOur success will likely depend on our ability to adapt and fund the rapid technological changes in our industry. Our failure to adopt a new technology or our choice of one technology over another may have an adverse effect on our ability to compete or meet the demands of our customers. Technological\nchanges could, among other things, reduce the barriers to entry facing our competitors providing local service in our service areas. The pace of technology change and our ability to deploy new technologies may be constrained by insufficient capital and/or the need to generate sufficient cash to make interest payments on our debt.\nNew products and services may arise out of technological developments and our inability to keep pace with these developments may reduce the attractiveness of our services. Some of our competitors may have greater resources to respond to changing technology than we do. If we fail to adapt successfully to technological changes or fail to obtain access to new technologies, we could lose customers and be unable to attract new customers and/or sell new services to our existing customers. We may be unable to successfully deliver new products and services, and we may not generate anticipated revenues from such products or services.\nTo be competitive we need to maintain an on-going investment program to continuously upgrade our access network. We define the access network as the connection from the end user location - either a home or a business - to the first aggregation point in the network. The connection can be copper or fiber and the aggregation point is typically a central office or remote serving node. The access network determines the speeds we are able to deliver to our end customer. We may not be able to maintain the level of investment needed for long term competitiveness in offering broadband speeds to all segments of our market.\nAs we seek to grow as the leading Cloud Enabler for businesses in Alaska, we will have to partner with various IT technology and cloud services providers. Technology trends and developments in this area can be far more disruptive and tend to change in shorter cycles compared to telecommunications technologies. Our ability to invest in the training, certifications, and skills required to develop these partnerships will be important in determining our success in this area of managed IT services.\nOur limited access to middle mile infrastructure limits our ability to compete in certain geographic and customer segments in Alaska.\nWe define middle mile as the connection between the first aggregation point into a local community and the interconnection point to the internet or switch which connects the community to the outside world. These are typically high capacity connections and can span hundreds of miles in the case of Alaska. It is unlikely that we will have the capital needed for middle mile investments, and GCI controls significant elements of the middle mile network in Alaska, and through its government funded programs is creating monopoly conditions in certain areas of the state. This limits our ability to compete in certain markets.\nRisks Relating to Our Debt\nOur debt could adversely affect our financial health, financing options and liquidity position, and our ability to service debt is, in part, dependent on maintaining the synergies achieved following the Wireless Sale. Due to uncertainty in the capital markets, we may be unable to retire or refinance our long-term debt when it becomes due, or if we are able to refinance it, we may not be able to do so with attractive interest rates or terms.\nSince 2012 we have been aggressively reducing the amount of our outstanding debt. As of December 31, 2015, we had total debt of $193.1 million, net of debt discounts. The Wireless Sale resulted in $240.5 million of debt reductions. In the third quarter of 2015, we entered into a combined $100.0 million of senior secured financing. Proceeds of $81.5 million and $10.0 million were used to repay in full the remaining balance of our 2010 Senior Credit Facility and purchase a portion of our 6.25% Notes, respectively. Our relatively complex debt structure involves two tranches of secured debt and a convertible notes issue. This requires us to enter the debt markets on a fairly regular basis as components of this structure mature. Continuing global, national, and state fiscal insecurity, as well as uncertainty regarding our future performance adds refinancing risk to the Company. At December 31, 2015, our debt consists of $89.8 million under the senior secured credit facilities, $104.0 million of 6.25% Convertible Notes ($99.3 million net of discounts) and $4.0 million of capital lease obligations.\nOur debt obligations require the following:\n\u2022\nMaintain a fixed amortization schedule of principal payments on our 2015 Senior Credit Facilities of $3,000 in 2016 and $4,000 in 2017.\n\u2022\nPerform against financial covenants under our 2015 Senior Credit Facilities.\nThe term loan components of our 2015 Senior Credit Facilities of $65,000 and $25,000, net of scheduled payments described above, mature on January 2, 2018 and March 3, 2018, respectively. Our revolving loan facility, which is undrawn, matures on January 2, 2018. The maturity dates on our 2015 Senior Credit Facilities may be extended to 2020 if the Company meets certain Convertible Note repurchase targets and liquidity requirements. Our Convertible notes are not callable and limit our flexibility with strategic acquisitions.\nOur debt also exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. As a component of our cash flow hedging strategy and as required under the terms of the 2015 Senior Credit Facilities, we hold a pay-fixed, receive-floating interest rate swap in the notional amount of $44.8 million at 5.833%, inclusive of a 4.5% LIBOR spread, for the period December 2015 through December 2017.\nWe are also subject to credit risk related to our counterparties on the swaps and to interest rate fluctuations on interest generated by our debt in excess of the notional term loans referenced above. For more specific information related to our exposure to changes in interest rates and our use of interest rate swaps, please see \u201cItem 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\u201d\nRisks Related to our Business\nAccess and High Cost Support Revenue\nRevenues from access charges will continue to decline and revenue from high cost loop support is subject to rule changes at the FCC.\nWe received approximately 22.9% and 18.6% of our operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, from interstate and intrastate access charges. The amount of revenue that we receive from these access charges is calculated in accordance with requirements set by the FCC and the RCA. Any change in these requirements may reduce our revenues and earnings. Access charges have consistently decreased in past years and we expect this trend to continue due to declines in voice usage and migration to VoIP services which do not generate access revenue for us.\nFurthermore, the FCC has actively reviewed new mechanisms for inter-carrier compensation that will eliminate certain access charges entirely. Elimination of access charges would have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. Similarly, the RCA has adopted regulations modifying intrastate access charges that may reduce our revenue.\nAs discussed in \u201cRegulations\u201d substantial changes are expected to be enacted by the FCC regarding our future high cost loop support funding and obligations thereunder. It is difficult to predict the future growth in this source of revenue as well as the future obligations that we will be required to accept that are tied to this funding.\nRegulations\nNew governmental regulations may impose obligations on us to upgrade our existing technology or adopt new technology that may require additional capital and we may not be able to comply in a timely manner with these new regulations.\nSome of our markets are regulated and we cannot predict the extent to which the government will impose new unfunded mandates on us. Such mandates have included those related to emergency location, emergency \u201cE-911\u201d calling, law enforcement assistance and local number portability. Each of these government mandates has imposed new requirements for capital that we could not have predicted with any precision. Along with these obligations, the FCC has imposed deadlines for compliance with these mandates. We may not be able to provide services that comply with these or other regulatory mandates. Further, we cannot predict whether other mandates from the FCC or other regulatory authorities will occur in the future or the demands they may place on our capital expenditures. For more information on our regulatory environment and the risks it presents to us, see \u201cItem 1, Business - Regulation\u201d.\nThere is a risk that FCC Orders will materially impact our revenue.\nThe 2011 Transformation Order establishes a new framework for high cost universal service support that replaced existing support mechanisms that provide support to carriers, like us, that serve high-cost areas with new CAF support mechanisms and service obligations that are focused on broadband Internet access services. Though the future rules remain unclear, we do not expect them to be as favorable to the Company as the prior rules and we expect conditions attached to future high cost support to require significant increases in capital spending to meet broadband deployment and service targets. We recognized $19.7 million and $23.2 million in federal high cost universal service payment\nrevenues to support our wireline operations in high cost areas in the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The FCC is currently considering what broadband deployment and service obligations it will require us to meet in connection with future federal high cost CAF support, along with the duration and other terms of support. The resulting uncertainty prevents us from accurately measuring the amount of our future high cost support, or the capital investment the Company will be required to make in connection with this support or the duration of the support. In addition, in March 2015, the FCC reclassified broadband Internet access service as a \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d that is now subject to a substantial body of legacy regulations that formerly applied only to traditional circuit switched telephone services. See the heading \u201cRegulation,\u201d above, for more detailed information.\nIn addition, the FCC has imposed strict new compliance requirements governing enrollment of low-income subscribers in the FCC\u2019s Lifeline program, which provides carriers like us with USF support to reduce the cost of wireline and wireless services to low-income consumers. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we recognized wireline and wireless lifeline revenue of $0.5 million and $0.2 million, respectively. Over the same period the number of Lifeline customers we served shifted from 1,828 wireline and 7,232 wireless lifeline customers to 1,402 wireline and 5,616 wireless Lifeline customers. Following the February 2015 completion of the sale of our wireless business, we no longer serve any wireless Lifeline customers. We expect the amount of Lifeline USF support we receive in connection with our wireline customers to continue to decrease, because we expect that it will be more difficult for low-income consumers to qualify for Lifeline, and to remain enrolled in Lifeline, than it was under the former rules.\nEconomic Conditions\nThe successful operation and growth of our businesses depends on economic conditions in Alaska which may deteriorate due to reductions in crude oil prices and other factors.\nThe vast majority of our customers and operations are located in Alaska. Due to our geographical concentration, the successful operation and growth of our businesses depends on economic conditions in Alaska. The Alaska economy, in turn, depends upon many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe strength of the natural resources industries, particularly oil production and prices of crude oil;\n\u2022\nthe strength of the Alaska tourism industry;\n\u2022\nthe level of government and military spending; and\n\u2022\nthe continued growth of service industries.\nThe population of Alaska is approximately 730,000 with Anchorage, Fairbanks and Juneau serving as the primary population and economic centers in the state.\nIt is estimated that one-third of Alaska\u2019s economy is dependent on federal spending, one-third on natural resources, in particular the production of crude oil, and the remaining one-third on drivers such as tourism, mining, timber, seafood, international air cargo and miscellaneous support services.\nAlaska\u2019s economy is dependent on investment by oil companies, and state tax revenues correlate with the price of oil as the State assesses a tax based on the retail price of oil that transits the pipeline from the North Slope. During 2014 and 2015, the price of crude oil dropped substantially, which is primarily impacting the state in two ways:\n1. Resource based companies have indicated, that although Alaska is a strategic area of investment, they are reducing their level of spending in the state, and in particular the North Slope, through reducing their operating costs. \u201cIn flight\u201d development projects are continuing, however, should the price of oil remain at its current levels, spending on future development is expected to be lower.\n2. The State of Alaska is expected to incur budget deficits, requiring reduction in state spending across multiple programs. The State of Alaska is not immune to volatility in the price of oil, and has established multi-year budgetary reserves that mitigate the impact of short term price declines. The State is expecting to reduce spending in its current fiscal year, but the amount of reduction is mitigated by the significant level of reserves on hand. Reduced spending by the State is expected to have a dampening effect on overall economic activity in the state.\nWhile the economy in Alaska, and Anchorage in particular, showed resilience in 2015, economists are forecasting that Alaska may experience declining population growth and a weaker job environment in certain employment sectors, including oil and gas, government, construction and business services, as a result of these dynamics.\nOur terrestrial fiber network on the North Slope of Alaska (described below) which allows us to provide broadband solutions to the oil and gas sector may be negatively impacted by declining crude oil prices in the near term. Additionally, overall macro impacts from a sustained lower price of crude oil, if maintained over time, will ultimately impact our growth in the future.\nThe tourism industry in Alaska remained strong through the summer of 2015. Visitor volume was up 7% year over year, increasing from 1,659,600 in the summer of 2014 to 1,780,000 in the summer of 2015. Reductions in crude oil prices typically result in lower retail prices of gasoline and other processed fuels. Such reductions can have a positive impact on the levels of tourism, including travel to and within the state of Alaska. Economists are currently predicting moderate employment growth in the leisure and hospitality sector in 2016.\nNorth Slope Fiber Optic Network\nOur joint venture with Quintillion Holdings, LLC established, in part, to provide broadband solutions to the North Slope of Alaska may not prove to be as successful as currently anticipated.\nDuring the second quarter of 2015, we acquired a fiber optic network on the North Slope of Alaska from ConocoPhillips Alaska, Inc. and entered into a joint venture with Quintillion to operate and expand the network. This network will enable commercially-available, high-speed connectivity where only high-cost microwave and satellite communications were available. The success of this joint venture is dependent, in part, on the utilization of the network by other telecom carriers.\nQuintillion is investing in a fiber optic system with contemplated landing stations in several northwest Alaska communities, including a link from the North Slope to Fairbanks. Delays in the completion of this system could impact our ability to acquire capacity on the North Slope to Fairbanks segment, thereby negatively impacting our market potential in that region.\nErosion of Access Lines\nWe provide services to many customers over access lines, and if we continue to lose access lines, our revenues, earnings and cash flow from operating activities may decrease.\nOur business generates revenue by delivering voice and data services over access lines. We have experienced net access line loss over the past few years and the rate of loss has been accelerating. During the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 our business access line erosion was 2,570 and 648, respectively, while over the same period our consumer access line erosion was 6,090 and 5,524 respectively. We expect to continue to experience net access line loss in our markets, affecting our revenues, earnings and cash flow from operating activities.\nNetwork / E-911 Failure\nA failure of our network could cause significant delays or interruptions of service, which could cause us to lose customers.\nTo be successful, we will need to continue to provide our customers reliable service over our network. Our network and infrastructure are constantly at risk of physical damage as a result of human, natural or other factors. These factors may include pandemics, acts of terrorism, sabotage, natural disasters, power surges or outages, software defects, contractor or vendor failures, labor disputes and other disruptions that may be beyond our control. Should we experience a prolonged system failure or a significant service interruption, our customers may choose a different provider and our reputation may be damaged. Further, we may not have adequate insurance coverage, which would result in unexpected expense. Notably, similar to other undersea fiber optic cable operators, we do not carry insurance that would cover the cost of repair of our undersea cables and, thus, we would bear the full cost of any necessary repairs.\nA failure of enhanced emergency calling services associated with our network may harm our business.\nWe provide E-911 service to our customers where such service is available. We also contract from time to\ntime with municipalities to upgrade their dispatch capabilities such that those facilities become capable of receiving our transmission of a 911 caller\u2019s location information and telephone number. If the emergency call center is unable to process such information, the caller is provided only basic 911 services. In these instances, the emergency caller may be required to verbally advise the operator of such caller\u2019s location at the time of the call. Any inability of the dispatchers to automatically recognize the caller\u2019s location or telephone number, whether or not it occurs as a result of our network operations, may cause us to incur liability or cause our reputation or financial results to suffer.\nEmployees\nWe depend on the availability of personnel with the requisite level of technical expertise in the telecommunications industry.\nOur ability to develop and maintain our networks and execute our business plan is dependent on the availability of technical engineering, IT, service delivery and monitoring, product development, sales, management, finance and other key personnel within our geographic location.\nLabor costs and the terms of our principal collective bargaining agreement can negatively impact our ability to remain competitive, which could cause our financial performance to suffer.\nLabor costs are a significant component of our expenses and, as of December 31, 2015, approximately 56% of our workforce is represented by the IBEW. We believe our labor costs are higher than our competitors who employ a non-unionized workforce because we are required by the CBA to contribute to the IBEW Health and Welfare Trust and the Alaska Electrical Pension Fund for benefit programs, including defined benefit pension plans and health benefit plans, that are not reflective of the competitive marketplace. Furthermore, work rules under the existing agreement limit our ability to efficiently manage our workforce and make the incremental cost of work performed outside normal work hours high. In addition, we may make strategic and operational decisions that require the consent of the IBEW. While we believe our relationship with the IBEW is constructive, and although the IBEW generally has provided necessary consents, the IBEW may not provide consent when we need it, it may require additional wages, benefits or other consideration be paid in return for its consent, or it may call for a work stoppage against the Company.\nOur current CBA with the IBEW that is in effect until December 31, 2016, includes provisions that allow us to be more cost competitive in certain areas. The IBEW has entered into several agreements with us over the last year which have provided for isolated cost savings; however, we may face resistance to changes that are essential for our future success. Should we not reach agreement with the IBEW on a new collective bargaining agreement that allows us to be competitive, our future financial results may be impacted. In the event of a work stoppage, we may be required to utilize cash on hand to support the funding of operations during the affected period.\nIn addition, the IBEW has brought unfair labor practice complaints and may continue to bring grievances to binding arbitration. The IBEW may also bring court actions and may seek to compel us to engage in the bargaining processes where we believe we have no such obligation. If successful, there is a risk these administrative, judicial or arbitral avenues could create additional costs that we did not anticipate.\nVendors\nWe rely on a limited number of key suppliers and vendors for timely supply of equipment and services for our network infrastructure and customer support services. If these suppliers or vendors experience problems or favor our competitors, we could fail to obtain the equipment and services we require to operate our business successfully.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers and vendors for equipment and services for our network and certain customer services. If suppliers of our equipment or providers of services on which we rely experience financial difficulties, service or billing interruptions, patent litigation or other problems, subscriber growth and our operating results could suffer.\nSuppliers that use proprietary technology, effectively lock us into one or a few suppliers for key network components. Other suppliers require us to maintain exclusive relationships under a contract. As a result, we have become reliant upon a limited number of suppliers of network equipment. In the event it becomes necessary to seek alternative suppliers and vendors, we may be unable to obtain satisfactory replacement suppliers or vendors on economically attractive terms on a timely basis, or at all, which could increase costs and may cause disruption in service.\nNetworks, Monitoring Centers and Data Hosting Facilities\nMaintaining the Company\u2019s networks, around the clock monitoring centers and data hosting facilities requires significant capital expenditures, and our inability or failure to maintain and upgrade our networks and data centers would have a material impact on our market share and ability to generate revenue.\nThe Company currently operates an extensive network that includes monitoring and hosting facilities. To provide contractual levels of service to our customers and remain competitive, we must expend significant amounts of capital. In many cases, we must rely on outside vendors whose performance and costs may not be sufficiently within our control.\nInformation Technology Systems\nA failure of back-office IT systems could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe efficient operation of the Company\u2019s business depends on back-office IT systems. The Company relies on back-office IT systems, including certain systems provided by third party vendors, to effectively manage customer billing, business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment and other business processes. Some of these systems are no longer supported under maintenance agreements from the underlying vendor. A failure of the Company\u2019s IT systems, or the IT systems provided by third party vendors, to perform as anticipated could disrupt the Company\u2019s business and result in a failure to collect accounts receivable, transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing the Company\u2019s reputation and results of operations to suffer. In addition, IT systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond the Company\u2019s control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, security breaches and viruses. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, margins and financial condition.\nUndersea Fiber Optic Cable Systems\nIf failures occur in our undersea fiber optic cable systems, our ability to immediately restore our service may be limited.\nOur undersea fiber optic cable systems carry a large portion of our traffic to and from the contiguous lower 48 states. If a failure occurs and we are not able to secure alternative facilities, some of the communications services we offer to our customers could be interrupted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nManaged IT Services\nOur expansion into managed IT services may not be achieved as planned which could impact our ability to grow revenue.\nWe are expanding our business to provide more managed IT services along with our traditional telecom services. The delivery of professional services is not without risk, and it is possible that we may fail to execute on one or more managed IT service projects exposing the company to legal claims and reputational risk.\nIntellectual Property\nThird parties may claim that the Company is infringing upon their intellectual property, and the Company could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products.\nAlthough the Company does not believe that any of its products or services infringe upon the valid intellectual property rights of third parties, the Company may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of its technology, products or services. Any litigation growing out of third party patents or other intellectual property claims could be costly and time consuming and could divert the Company\u2019s management and key personnel from its business operations. The complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks. Resolution\nof claims of intellectual property infringement might also require the Company to enter into costly license agreements. Likewise, the Company may not be able to obtain license agreements on acceptable terms. The Company also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain of its products. Further, the Company often relies on licenses of third party intellectual property for its businesses. The Company cannot ensure these licenses will be available in the future on favorable terms or at all. If any of these risks materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, margins and financial condition.\nSecurity Breaches\nA failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could disrupt our businesses, result in the disclosure of confidential information or damage our reputation. Any such failure also could have a significant adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant, the security of our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact. Additionally, breaches of security may occur through intentional or unintentional acts by those having authorized or unauthorized access to confidential or other information. If one or more such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our information or our customers\u2019 information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures arising from operational and security risks, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us.\nWith regard to the physical infrastructure that supports our operations, we have taken measures to implement backup systems and other safeguards, but our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any disruption to that infrastructure. Such disruptions could involve electrical, communications, internet, transportation or other services used by us or third parties with whom we conduct business. The costs associated with such disruptions, including any loss of business, could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nAny of these operational and security risks could lead to significant and negative consequences, including reputational harm as well as loss of customers and business opportunities, which in turn could have a significant adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nCyber-attacks may damage our networks or breach customer and other proprietary data, leading to service disruption, harm to reputation, loss of customers, and litigation over privacy violations.\nAll industries that rely on technology in customer interactions are increasingly at risk for cyber-attacks. A cyber-attack could be levied against our network, causing disruption of operations and service, requiring implementation of greater network security measures, and resulting in lost revenue due to lost service. A cyber-attack could also be targeted to infiltrate customer proprietary and other data, breaching customer privacy, resulting in misuse of customer information and other data, and possibly leading to litigation over privacy breaches and causing harm to the Company\u2019s reputation. We rely on a variety of procedures to guard against cyber-attacks, but the frequency of threats from these attacks is growing globally and the risk to us is also growing.\nPension Plans\nWe may incur substantial and unexpected liabilities arising out of our pension plans.\nOur pension plans could result in substantial liabilities on our balance sheet. These plans and activities have and will generate substantial cash requirements for us and these requirements may increase beyond our expectations in future years based on changing market conditions. The difference between projected plan obligations and assets, or the funded status of the plans, is a significant factor in determining the net periodic benefit costs of our pension plans and the ongoing funding requirements of those plans. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates,\ninvestment returns and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension and cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plans. In the future, we may be required to make additional contributions to our defined benefit plan. Plan liabilities may impair our liquidity, have an unfavorable impact on our ability to obtain financing and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors who do not have such liabilities and cash requirements.\nOur most significant pension plan is the Alaska Electrical Pension Fund (the \u201cAEPF\u201d) in which we participate on behalf of substantially all of our employees. The AEPF is a multi-employer pension plan to which we make fixed, per employee, contributions through our collective bargaining agreement with the IBEW, which covers our IBEW represented workforce, and a special agreement, which covers most of our non-represented workforce. Because our contribution requirements are fixed, we cannot easily adjust our annual plan contributions to address our own financial circumstances. Currently, this plan is not fully funded, which means we may be subject to increased contribution obligations, penalties, and ultimately we could incur a contingent withdrawal liability should we choose to withdraw from the AEPF for economic reasons. Our contingent withdrawal liability is an amount based on our pro-rata share among AEPF participants of the value of the funding shortfall. This contingent liability becomes due and payable by us if we terminate our participation in the AEPF. Moreover, if another participant in the AEPF goes bankrupt, we would become liable for a pro-rata share of the bankrupt participant\u2019s vested, but unpaid, liability for accrued benefits for that participant\u2019s employees. This could result in a substantial unexpected contribution requirement and making such a contribution could have a material adverse effect on our cash position and other financial results. These sources of potential liability are difficult to predict.\nGiven the complexity of pension-related matters we may not, in every instance, be in full compliance with applicable requirements.\nKey Members of Senior Management\nWe depend on key members of our senior management team; our performance could be adversely impacted if they depart and we cannot find suitable replacements.\nOur success depends largely on the skills, experience and performance of key members of our senior management team as well as our ability to attract and retain other highly qualified management and technical personnel. There is competition for qualified personnel in our industry and we may not be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the development of our business. Our remote location also presents a challenge to us in attracting new talent. If we lose one or more of our key employees, our ability to successfully implement our business plan could be materially adversely affected. We do not maintain any \u201ckey person\u201d insurance on any of our personnel.\nFuture Acquisitions\nFuture acquisitions could result in operating and financial difficulties.\nOur future growth may depend, in part, on acquisitions. To the extent that we grow through acquisitions, we will face the operational and financial risks that commonly accompany that strategy. We would also face operational risks, such as failing to assimilate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses, disrupting their ongoing businesses, increasing the complexity of our business, and impairing management resources and management\u2019s relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes in their ownership and management. Further, the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, as well as the integration of an acquired business, may divert management time and other resources. Some acquisitions may not be successful and their performance may result in the impairment of their carrying value.\nVolatility Risks Related to our Common Stock\nContinued volatility in the price of our common stock could negatively affect us and our stockholders.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been impacted by the limited number of shares outstanding, and by a significant number of transactions such as the AWN Formation and the Wireless Sale. Additional factors, many of which are beyond our control, include actual or anticipated variations in quarterly financial results, changes in financial expectations by securities analysts and announcements by our\ncurrent and future competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments. In addition, our financial results in the future may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. Broad market and industry factors could also negatively affect the price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance. Future volatility in our stock price could materially adversely affect the trading market and prices for our common stock as well as our ability to issue additional securities or to secure additional financing.\nDeclines in our Market Capitalization or Share Price\nDeclines in our market capitalization or share price may affect our ability to access the capital markets.\nOur ability to issue convertible notes is, in part, a function of our share price and market capitalization, as is our ability to be listed on a national stock exchange. To the extent either declines substantially, our ability to access the capital markets may be impaired.\nLocation Specific Risk\nWe operate in remote areas subject to geologic instability and other natural events which could negatively impact our operations.\nMany of our operations are located in areas that are prone to earthquakes, fires, and other natural disturbances. Many of these areas have limited emergency response assets and may be difficult to reach in an emergency situation. Should an event occur, it could be weeks or longer before remediation efforts could be implemented, if they could be implemented at all. The scope and risk of such an event occurring is difficult to gauge.", "PERMNO": 87373, "SIC": 4813, "TIC": "ALSK"}
