{"cik": "1166928", "company": "WEST BANCORPORATION INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-05", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWest Bancorporation's business is conducted almost exclusively through West Bank. West Bancorporation and West Bank are subject to many of the common risks that challenge publicly traded, regulated financial institutions. An investment in West Bancorporation's common stock is also subject to the following specific risks.\nRisks Related to West Bancorporation's Business\nOur loan portfolio primarily includes commercial loans, which involve risks specific to commercial borrowers.\nThe largest component of West Bank's income is interest received on loans. Its loan portfolio includes a significant amount of commercial real estate loans, construction or land development loans, commercial lines of credit and commercial term loans. West Bank's typical commercial borrower is a small or medium-sized, privately owned Iowa or Minnesota business entity. Our commercial loans typically have greater credit risks than standard residential mortgage or consumer loans because commercial loans often have larger balances, and repayment usually depends on the borrowers' successful business operations. Commercial loans also involve some additional risk because they generally are not fully repaid over the loan period and thus may require refinancing or a large payoff at maturity. If the general economy turns substantially downward, commercial borrowers may not be able to repay their loans and the value of their assets, which are usually pledged as collateral, may decrease rapidly and significantly. Also, when credit markets tighten due to adverse developments in specific markets or the general economy, opportunities for refinancing may become more expensive or unavailable, resulting in loan defaults. Our success is also dependent to a large extent upon the geographical areas in which we operate. Competition for quality loans in our market areas continues to be robust.\nOur loan portfolio includes commercial real estate loans, which involve risks specific to real estate value.\nCommercial real estate loans were a significant portion of our total loan portfolio as of December 31, 2014. The market value of real estate can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time as a result of market conditions in the geographic area in which the real estate is located. Adverse developments affecting real estate values in one or more of our markets could increase the credit risk associated with our loan portfolio. Additionally, real estate lending typically involves higher loan principal amounts, and repayment of the loans is generally dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Economic events or governmental regulations outside of the control of the borrower or lender could negatively impact the future cash flow and market values of the affected properties.\nIf the loans that are collateralized by real estate become troubled and the value of the real estate has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time of originating the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe must effectively manage our credit risks.\nOur business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. There are obvious risks inherent in making loans. We attempt to reduce our credit risk through prudent loan application, underwriting and approval procedures, including internal loan reviews before and after proceeds have been disbursed, careful monitoring of the concentration of our loans within specific industries, and collateral and guarantee requirements. These procedures cannot, however, be expected to completely eliminate our credit risks, and we can make no guarantees concerning the strength of our loan portfolio.\nNonperforming loans take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2014, West Bank's nonperforming loans, which consist of nonaccrual loans, loans past due 90 days and still accruing, and troubled debt restructured (TDR) loans, totaled $1.9 million or 0.16 percent of our loan portfolio. While this total has declined over the past five years to be in line with our historical experience, nonperforming loans adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans, thereby negatively affecting our income and returns on assets and equity, and significantly increasing our administrative costs. Nonperforming loans require significant time commitments from management and our lending staff, which takes time away from other duties, including the generation of new business.\nOur allowance for loan losses may be insufficient to absorb potential losses in our loan portfolio.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level we believe adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our existing loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; credit loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present economic, political and regulatory conditions; and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio.\nDetermination of the allowance is inherently subjective as it requires significant estimates and management\u2019s judgment of credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. Deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of management. Also, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance. Any increases in provisions will result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with real estate collateral securing our loans.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. Under certain circumstances, we may take title to the real property collateral through foreclosure or other means. As the titleholder of the property, we may be responsible for environmental risks, such as hazardous materials, which attach to the property. For these reasons, prior to extending credit, we have an environmental risk assessment program to identify any known environmental risks associated with the real property that will secure our loans. In addition, we routinely inspect properties following the taking of title. When environmental risks are found, environmental laws and regulations may prescribe our approach to remediation. As a result, while we have ownership of a property, we may incur substantial expense and bear potential liability for any damages caused. The environmental risks may also materially reduce the property's value or limit our ability to use or sell the property. We also cannot guarantee that our environmental risk assessment will detect all environmental issues relating to a property, which could subject us to additional liability.\nIf a significant portion of any future unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities were to become other than temporarily impaired with credit losses, we would recognize a material charge to our earnings, and our capital ratios would be adversely impacted.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the fair value of our securities portfolio was approximately $324.3 million. Factors beyond our control can significantly influence the fair value of securities in our portfolio and can cause potential adverse changes to the fair value of those securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, rating agency downgrades of the securities, defaults by the issuer or individual mortgagors with respect to the underlying securities, and instability in the credit markets. Any of the foregoing factors could cause an other than temporary impairment (OTTI) in future periods and result in realized losses.\nWe analyze our investment securities quarterly to determine whether, in the opinion of management, any of the securities have OTTI. To the extent that any portion of the unrealized losses in our portfolio of investment securities is determined to have OTTI and is credit-loss related, we will recognize a charge to our earnings in the quarter during which such determination is made, and our capital ratios will be adversely impacted. Generally, a fixed income security is determined to have OTTI when it appears unlikely that we will receive all of the principal and interest due in accordance with the original terms of the investment. In addition to credit losses, losses are recognized for a security with an unrealized loss if the Company has the intent to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before collection of the principal amount.\nOur accounting policies and methods are the basis for how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and they may require management to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods in order to ensure they comply with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and reflect management's judgment as to the most appropriate manner in which to record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances. The application of that chosen accounting policy or method might result in us reporting different amounts than would have been reported under a different alternative. If management's estimates or assumptions are incorrect, the Company may experience material loss.\nWe have identified three accounting policies as being \"critical\" to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they require management to make particularly subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. These critical accounting policies relate to: (1) determining the fair value and possible OTTI of investment securities, (2) the allowance for loan losses, and (3) determining the valuation of other real estate owned. Because of the inherent uncertainty of these estimates, no assurance can be given that application of alternative policies or methods might not result in the reporting of different amounts of the fair value of investment securities, the allowance for loan losses, or the fair value of other real estate owned and, accordingly, net income .\nFrom time to time, the FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of our external financial statements. These changes are beyond our control, can be difficult to predict and could materially impact how we report our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in these standards are continuously occurring, and given the current economic environment, more drastic changes may occur. The implementation of such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to liquidity risks.\nWest Bank maintains liquidity primarily through customer deposits and other short-term funding sources, including advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and purchased federal funds. If economic influences change so that we do not have access to short-term credit, or our depositors withdraw a substantial amount of their funds for other uses, West Bank might experience liquidity issues. Our efforts to monitor and manage liquidity risk may not be successful or sufficient to deal with dramatic or unanticipated reductions in our liquidity. In such events, our cost of funds may increase, thereby reducing our net interest income, or we may need to sell a portion of our investment portfolio, which, depending upon market conditions, could result in the Company or West Bank realizing losses.\nAlthough we believe West Bank's current sources of funds are adequate for its liquidity needs, there can be no assurance in this regard for the future. Liquidity issues during the financial crisis were severe for regional and community banks, as some of the larger financial institutions significantly curtailed their lending to regional and community banks. In addition, many of the larger correspondent lenders reduced or even eliminated federal funds lines for their correspondent customers. If this were to occur again, and additional debt is needed in the future, there can be no assurance that such debt would be available or, if available, would be on favorable terms.\nThe competition for banking and financial services in our market areas is high, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets and face strong competition in originating loans, seeking deposits and offering our other services. We compete in making loans, attracting deposits, and recruiting and retaining talented people. The Des Moines metropolitan market area, in particular, has attracted many new financial institutions within the last two decades. We also compete with nonbank financial service providers, many of which are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions that we are and may be able to compete more effectively as a result.\nCustomer loyalty can be influenced by a competitor's new products, especially if those offerings are priced lower than our products. Some of our competitors may also be better able to attract customers because they provide products and services over a larger geographic area than we serve. This competitive climate can make it more difficult to establish and maintain relationships with new and existing customers, can lower the rate that we are able to charge on loans, and can affect our charges for other services. Our growth and profitability depend on our continued ability to compete effectively within our market, and our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nTechnology and other changes are allowing customers to complete financial transactions using nonbanks that historically have involved banks at one or both ends of the transaction. For example, customers can now pay bills and transfer funds directly without going through a bank. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as disintermediation, could result in the loss of fee income as well as the loss of customer deposits.\nLoss of customer deposits due to increased competition could increase our funding costs.\nWe rely on bank deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding. We compete with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. If our competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits, our funding costs may increase, either because we raise our rates to avoid losing deposits or because we lose deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. Higher funding costs could reduce our net interest margin and net interest income and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to continue to accurately process large volumes of transactions could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nWe process large volumes of transactions on a daily basis in our branches and through our third-party processor, and are exposed to numerous types of operational risk. Operational risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems includes the risk of fraud by persons inside or outside West Bank, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and systems, and breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of the operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards.\nWe establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that are designed to provide us with timely and accurate information about our level of operational risk. These systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate, cost-effective levels. Procedures also exist that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics and business practices are followed. From time to time, losses from operational risk may occur because of operational errors.\nWhile we continually monitor and improve the system of internal controls, data processing systems and corporate-wide processes and procedures, there can be no assurance that future losses will not occur.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results and could increase the risk of fraud.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. Management believes that our internal controls over financial reporting are currently effective. While management will continue to assess our controls and procedures and take immediate action to remediate any future perceived issues, there can be no guarantee of the effectiveness of these controls and procedures on an ongoing basis. Any failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis, which could result in regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence, and an adverse impact on our business operations and stock price.\nCybersecurity events could negatively affect our reputation, subject us to financial loss or result in litigation.\nWest Bank has access to large amounts of confidential financial information and controls substantial financial assets belonging to its customers, as well as the Company. West Bank offers its customers continuous remote access to their accounts in several different ways and otherwise regularly transfers substantial financial assets by electronic means. Accordingly, cybersecurity is a material risk for West Bank.\nWest Bank depends on third-party data processing and the communication and exchange of information on a variety of platforms, networks, and over the internet. West Bank cannot be certain that all of its systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack, despite safeguards that it has installed. West Bank does business with a number of third-party service providers and vendors with respect to West Bank's business, data and communications needs. If information security is breached, or if one of West Bank's employees or vendors breaches compliance procedures, information could be lost or misappropriated in manners resulting in financial loss to West Bank, damages to others or potential litigation. Cyber incidents such as computer break-ins, phishing, identity theft and other disruptions could jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure, which may result in significant liability to us in excess of any applicable insurance coverage, and may cause existing and potential customers to refrain from doing business with us. Although we, with the help of third-party service providers, will continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such losses, there can be no assurance that these security measures will be successful.\nDamage to our reputation could adversely affect our business.\nOur business depends upon earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers, investors and employees. Damage to our reputation could cause significant harm to our business. Harm to our reputation can arise from numerous sources, including employee misconduct, compliance failures, litigation or governmental investigations, among other things. In addition, a failure to deliver appropriate standards of service, or a failure or perceived failure to treat customers and clients fairly, can result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation, and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and harm to our reputation. Adverse publicity about West Bank, whether or not true, may also result in harm to our business. Should any events or circumstances that could undermine our reputation occur, there can be no assurance that the additional costs and expenses that we may incur in addressing such issues would not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various legal claims and litigation.\nWe are periodically involved in routine litigation incidental to our business, including the litigation disclosed in Item 3 of this Form 10-K. Regardless of whether these claims and legal actions are founded or unfounded, if such legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by these legal claims could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEmployee, customer or third-party fraud could cause substantial losses.\nWest Bank's business involves financial assets. Financial assets are always potential targets for fraudulent activities. Employee, customer or third-party fraud could subject us to operational losses, regulatory sanctions and could seriously harm our reputation. Misconduct by our employees, customers or third-parties could include unauthorized activities, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of a customer, deceit or misappropriation. We maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate operational risks; however, it is not always possible to prevent such misconduct. Should our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds our insurance limits, a fraud could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial conditions. Fraud does not even have to be aimed at West Bank to cause a loss. Losses are possible even where a customer is the victim of fraud or misappropriation if bank collateral is involved.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nFinancial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings.\nWe may experience difficulties in managing our growth.\nIn 2013, we opened an office in Rochester, Minnesota. In the future, we may decide to expand into additional communities or attempt to strengthen our position in our current markets through opportunistic acquisitions of all or part of other financial institutions or related businesses that we believe provide a strategic fit with our business, or by opening new branches or loan production offices. To the extent that we undertake acquisitions or new office openings, we are likely to experience the effects of higher operating expense relative to operating income from the new operations, which may have an adverse effect on our overall levels of reported net income, return on average equity and return on average assets. Other effects of engaging in such growth strategies may include potential diversion of our management's time and attention and general disruption to our business.\nTo the extent that we grow through acquisitions or office openings, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to adequately or profitably manage such growth. Acquiring other banks and businesses will involve risks similar to those commonly associated with new office openings, but may also involve additional risks. These additional risks include potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of banks and businesses we acquire, exposure to potential asset quality issues of the acquired bank or related business, difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of banks and businesses we acquire, and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the banks and businesses we acquire.\nMaintaining or increasing our market share may depend on lowering prices and the adoption of new products and services.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards. There is increased pressure to provide products and services at lower prices. Lower prices can reduce our net interest margin and revenues from our fee-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies could require us to make substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our existing products and services. Also, these and other capital investments in our business may not produce expected growth in earnings anticipated at the time of the expenditure. We may not be successful in introducing new products and services, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, or developing and maintaining loyal customers.\nThe loss of the services of any of our senior executive officers or key personnel could cause our business to suffer.\nMuch of our success is due to our ability to attract and retain senior management and key personnel experienced in bank and financial services who are very involved in our market area communities. Our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the continued services of relatively few individuals. The loss of services of a few of our senior executive officers or key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, at least in the short term. In addition, our success depends in significant part upon our senior management's ability to develop and implement our business strategies.\nDisruption of infrastructure could adversely impact our operations.\nOur operations depend upon our technological and physical infrastructures, particularly those located at our home office. Extended disruption of our vital infrastructures due to fire, power loss, natural disaster, telecommunications failure, computer hacking and viruses, or other events could detrimentally affect our financial performance. We have developed disaster recovery plans to mitigate this risk but can make no assurances that these plans will be effective.\nRisks Related to West Bancorporation's Common Stock\nOur stock is relatively thinly traded.\nAlthough our common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, the average daily trading volume of our common stock is relatively small compared to many public companies. The desired market characteristics of depth, liquidity, and orderliness require the substantial presence of willing buyers and sellers in the marketplace at any given time. In our case, this presence depends on the individual decisions of a relatively small number of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Due to the relatively small trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause the stock price to fall more than would be justified by the inherent worth of the Company. Conversely, attempts to purchase a significant amount of our stock could cause the market price to rise above the reasonable inherent worth of the Company.\nThere can be no assurances concerning continuing dividend payments.\nOur common stockholders are only entitled to receive the dividends declared by our Board of Directors. In 2014, our Board declared a cash dividend on our common stock in the first quarter of $0.11 per share, dividends of $0.12 per share in each of the second and third quarters, and a dividend of $0.14 per share in the fourth quarter. A dividend of $0.14 per common share was declared in the first quarter of 2015. Although we have historically paid quarterly dividends on our common stock, there can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends or that any dividends we do declare will be in any particular amount. The primary source of money to pay our dividends comes from dividends paid to the Company by West Bank. West Bank's ability to pay dividends to the Company is subject to, among other things, its earnings, financial condition and applicable regulations, which in some instances limit the amount that may be paid as dividends.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company had $20.6 million of junior subordinated debentures held by a statutory business trust that the Company controls. Interest payments on the debentures, which totaled approximately $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, must be paid before the Company pays dividends on its capital stock, including its common stock. Although the Company has always made its interest payments on time, the Company has the right to defer interest payments on the debentures for up to 20 consecutive quarters. However, if the Company elects to defer interest payments, all deferred interest must be paid before the Company may pay dividends on its capital stock.\nIssuing additional common or preferred stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, and capital may not be available when needed.\nThe Company may issue additional common or preferred shares in order to raise capital at some date in the future to support continued growth, either internally generated or through an acquisition. Common shares have been and will be issued through the Company's 2012 Equity Incentive Plan as grants of restricted stock units vest. As additional shares of common or preferred stock are issued, the ownership interests of our existing stockholders may be diluted. The market price of our common stock might decline or fail to advance in response to issuing additional common or preferred shares. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control. Accordingly, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital, if needed, at acceptable terms.\nWe are required to maintain capital to meet regulatory requirements, and if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, whether due to an inability to raise capital, operational losses, or otherwise, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as our ability to maintain regulatory compliance, would be adversely affected.\nThe Company and West Bank are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support their operations, which increased on January 1, 2015, with the implementation of the Basel III Rule. The ability to raise additional capital, when and if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions, and a number of other factors, including investor perceptions regarding the banking industry and market conditions, and governmental activities, many of which are outside of our control, as well as on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital, if needed, or on terms acceptable to us. Failure to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements could affect customer confidence, our ability to grow, the costs of funds, FDIC insurance costs, the ability to pay dividends on common stock and to make distributions on the junior subordinated debentures, the ability to make acquisitions, and the results of operations and financial condition.\nThe holders of our junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the Company had $20.6 million in junior subordinated debentures outstanding that were issued to the Company's subsidiary trust, West Bancorporation Capital Trust I. The junior subordinated debentures are senior to the Company's shares of common stock. As a result, the Company must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures (and the related trust preferred securities (TPS)) before any dividends can be paid on its common stock and, in the event of the Company's bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation, the holders of the debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of the common stock. The Company has the right to defer distributions on the junior subordinated debentures (and the related TPS) for up to five years during which time no dividends may be paid to holders of the Company's common stock. The Company's ability to pay future distributions depends upon the earnings of West Bank and the issuance of dividends from West Bank to the Company, which may be inadequate to service the obligations. Interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures underlying the TPS are classified as a \u201cdividend\u201d by the Federal Reserve supervisory policies and therefore are subject to applicable restrictions and approvals imposed by the Federal Reserve Board on the Company.\nRisks Related to the Banking Industry in General and Community Banking in Particular\nWe may be materially and adversely affected by the highly regulated environment in which we operate.\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, supervision and examination. A more detailed description of the primary federal and state banking laws and regulations that affect us is contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-K in the section captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation.\u201d Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, FDIC funds, customers and the banking system as a whole, rather than our stockholders. These regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things.\nAs a bank holding company, we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision and undergo periodic examinations by our regulators, who have extensive discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks and bank holding companies. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil monetary penalties and/or damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Although we have policies and procedures designed to mitigate the risk of any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur.\nThe laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies and interpretations governing us are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time. For example, on July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law, which significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. The Dodd-Frank Act, together with the regulations to be developed thereunder, includes provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike, including several provisions that affect how community banks, thrifts and small bank and thrift holding companies will be regulated. In addition, the Federal Reserve, in recent years, has adopted numerous new regulations addressing banks\u2019 overdraft and mortgage lending practices. Further, the CFPB was established with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws, and additional consumer protection legislation and regulatory activity is anticipated in the near future.\nIn July 2013, the U.S. federal banking authorities approved the implementation of the Basel III Rules. The Basel III Rules are applicable to all U.S. banks that are subject to minimum capital requirements as well as to bank and saving and loan holding companies, other than \u201csmall bank holding companies\u201d (generally bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $1.0 billion). The Basel III Rules became effective on January 1, 2015, with a phase-in period through 2019 for many of the changes.\nThe Basel III Rules not only increase most of the required minimum regulatory capital ratios, but they also introduce a new Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio and the concept of a capital conservation buffer. The Basel III Rules also expand the current definition of capital by establishing additional criteria that capital instruments must meet to be considered Additional Tier 1 Capital (i.e., Tier 1 Capital in addition to Common Equity) and Tier 2 Capital. A number of instruments that now generally qualify as Tier 1 Capital will not qualify, or their qualifications will change when the Basel III Rules are fully implemented. However, the Basel III Rules permit banking organizations with less than $15 billion in assets to retain, through a one-time election, the existing treatment for accumulated other comprehensive income, which currently does not affect regulatory capital. The Basel III Rules have maintained the general structure of the current prompt corrective action thresholds while incorporating the increased requirements, including the Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio. In order to be a \u201cwell-capitalized\u201d depository institution under the new regime, an institution must maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio of 6.5 percent or more; a Tier 1 Capital ratio of 8.0 percent or more; a Total Capital ratio of 10.0 percent or more; and a leverage ratio of 5.0 percent or more. Institutions must also maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital to avoid certain restrictions on dividends and compensation.\nThese provisions, as well as any other aspects of current or proposed regulatory or legislative changes to laws applicable to the financial industry, may impact the profitability of our business activities and may change certain of our business practices, including our ability to offer new products, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads and could expose us to additional costs, including increased compliance costs. These changes also may require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes to operations in order to comply and could therefore also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to domestic and, to a lesser extent, international economic conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond our control and could materially and adversely affect us.\nOur financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of customers to pay interest on and repay principal on outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer, is highly dependent upon the business environment, not only in the markets where we operate, but also in the states of Iowa and Minnesota, generally, in the United States as a whole, and internationally. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity, or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment; natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.\nOverall, although improving, the business environment in recent years was unfavorable for many households and businesses in the United States. While economic conditions in our market, the states of Iowa and Minnesota and the United States have generally improved since the recession, there can be no assurance that this improvement will continue or occur at a meaningful rate. A return of recessionary conditions and/or continued negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the value of our loans and investments, and our ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Such conditions could materially and adversely affect us.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve to implement these objectives are open market operations in U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate, and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The specific effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nChanges in interest rates could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nEarnings in the banking industry, particularly the community bank segment, are substantially dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets (investments and loans) and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities (deposits and borrowings). Interest rates are sensitive to many factors, including government monetary and fiscal policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. During the last few years, interest rates have been at historically low levels. If interest rates increase, banks will experience competitive pressures to increase rates paid on deposits. Depending on competitive pressures, such deposit rate increases may increase faster than rates received on loans, which may reduce net interest income during the transition periods. Changes in interest rates could also influence our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, and the average duration of our securities portfolio. Community banks, such as West Bank, rely more heavily on net interest income than do larger institutions that have additional non-lending sources of income.\nTechnological advances.\nThe banking industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables banks to better serve customers. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to effectively implement new technology. Many of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources than we do to invest in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer, or more quickly offer, additional or superior products that put West Bank at somewhat of a competitive disadvantage.", "PERMNO": 89425, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "WTBA"}
