{"cik": "1617669", "company": "Unique Fabricating, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-09", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below are certain risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by the Company. Also refer to the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe have substantial debt and if we were to default on paying our debt or fail to comply with the covenants, our lenders could take action that would likely cause our stockholders to lose their entire investment in us.\nAs of January 1, 2017, we had approximately $50.6 million of debt outstanding under our senior secured credit facility. Substantially all of our assets are pledged to the lenders to secure this outstanding debt. In the event that we are unable to make principal, interest or other payments due under or we do not comply with the covenants contained in the senior secured credit facility, the lenders could declare an event of default, accelerate all amounts outstanding and seek to foreclose on the collateral securing such indebtedness. In such event, we could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection and stockholders would likely lose their entire investment in us.\nThe agreement governing our senior secured credit facility contains financial covenants and other covenants that may restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions. If we are unable to comply with these covenants, our business, results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants in the senior secured credit facility agreement may be affected by economic or business conditions beyond our control. If we are not able to comply with these covenants when required and we are unable to obtain necessary waivers or amendments from the lenders, we would be precluded from borrowing under the credit facility. If we are unable to borrow under the credit facility, we will need to meet our liquidity requirements using other sources. Alternative sources of liquidity may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, if we do not comply with the financial or other covenants in the credit facility when required, the lenders could declare an event of default under the credit facility, and our indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable. The lenders would also have the right in these circumstances to terminate any commitments they have to provide further borrowings. Any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and liquidity.\nIn addition, the credit facility contains covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nincur or assume additional debt or guarantees;\n\u2022\npay dividends, or make redemptions and repurchases, with respect to capital stock;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers, acquisitions, asset sales, sale/leaseback transactions and transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nchange the business conducted by us or our subsidiaries.\nThe operating and financial restrictions and covenants in this debt agreement and any future financing agreements may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities.\nOur substantial amount of indebtedness may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business, remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on our indebtedness.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay, when due, the principal of, interest on or other amounts due with respect to our indebtedness. The level of our indebtedness could have other important consequences to you as a stockholder. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and any failure to comply with the obligations under our credit facility, including financial and other restrictive covenants, could result in an event of default under the senior secured credit facility;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, pay dividends and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other purposes.\nAny of the above listed factors could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe senior secured credit facility contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of our debt.\nOur major customers may exert significant influence over us.\nThe vehicle component supply industry has traditionally been highly fragmented and serves a limited number of large OEMs. As a result, OEMs have historically had a significant amount of leverage over their outside suppliers. Our contracts with major OEM and Tier 1 customers frequently provide for an annual productivity cost reduction. Historically, cost reductions through product design changes, increased productivity and similar programs with our suppliers have generally offset these customer-imposed productivity cost reduction requirements. However, if we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions, our gross margin and profitability would be adversely affected. In addition, changes in our customers\u2019 purchasing policies or payment practices could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe loss or insolvency of any of our major customers would adversely affect our future results.\nWe are dependent on several principal customers. Our three largest customers, in the aggregate, accounted for approximately 16.4% of our net sales for the year ended January 1, 2017. We have not entered into long-term agreements with any of our customers. Instead, we enter into a number of purchase order commitments with our customers, based on their current or projected needs. We have in the past lost, and may in the future, lose customers due to the highly competitive conditions in the industries we serve, including pricing pressures. A decision by any significant customer, whether motivated by competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to materially decrease the amount of products purchased from us, to change their manner of doing business with us or to stop doing business with us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have no long-term contracts with customers.\nWe supply our products based on purchase orders placed by our customers from time to time but have no long-term contracts with our customers. We will commit to end-product pricing for a specified quantity of product for the duration of a vehicle\u2019s production, generally three to five years. In the past, we successfully mitigated price volatility though aggressive supplier management and alternative material substitution strategies. Typically, our products are refreshed during a vehicle\u2019s production life creating opportunities to modify pricing if material costs have risen. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement or sustain such strategies in the future or modify pricing to pass potential increases in material costs to customers. Our inability to do so could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nOur inability to compete effectively in the highly competitive vehicle component supply industry could result in lower prices for our products, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results.\nThe vehicle component supply industry is highly competitive. Our products primarily compete on the basis of price, breadth of product offerings, product quality, technical expertise and development capability, product delivery and product service. Increased competition may lead to price reductions resulting in reduced gross margins and loss of market share.\nCurrent and future competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others, foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do, develop products that are superior to our\nproducts, produce similar products at lower cost than we can or adapt more quickly to new technologies, industry or customer requirements. By doing so, they may enhance their ability to meet the needs of our customers or potential future customers. These developments could limit our ability to obtain revenues from new customers and to maintain existing revenues from our existing customer base. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe rely on raw materials suppliers in our business and significant shortages, supplier capacity constraints or supplier production disruptions could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nOur reliance on suppliers to secure raw materials exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of our products. A disruption in deliveries from suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or could increase our operating costs. Moreover, the cost of raw materials used in the production of our products, represents a significant portion of our direct manufacturing costs. The number of customers to which we are not able to pass on such price increases may increase in the future. We believe that our supply management and production practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Nonetheless, price increases, supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions or the unavailability of some raw materials may have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. If we are not able to buy raw materials at fixed prices or pass on price increases to our customers, we may lose orders or enter into orders with less favorable terms, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe conduct certain of our manufacturing in Mexico and Canada, therefore, are subject to risks associated with doing business outside the United States, including the possible effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nWe have two manufacturing facilities in Mexico and one in Canada. There are a number of risks associated with doing business in Mexico and Canada, including, exposure to local economic and political conditions, social unrest, including risks of terrorism or other hostilities, export and import restrictions, and the potential for shortages of trained labor. Our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars. Because a portion of our manufacturing costs are incurred in Mexican pesos and Canadian dollars, fluctuations in the U.S. dollar/Mexican peso and U.S dollar/Canadian dollar exchange rates may have a material effect on our profitability, cash flows, financial position, and may significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods. Any depreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the value of the Mexican peso or Canadian dollar will adversely affect the cost of our Mexican and Canadian operations when remeasured into U.S. dollars. Similarly, any appreciation in the value of the U.S. dollar in relation to the value of the Mexican peso or Canadian dollar will decrease the cost of our Mexican and Canadian operations when remeasured into U.S. dollars. These risks may materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPrior periods of weakness in the global economy, the global credit markets and the financial services industry severely and negatively affected demand for automobiles and automobile parts and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDemand for and pricing of our products are subject to economic conditions and other factors present in the various markets where our products are sold. The level of demand for our products depends primarily upon the level of consumer demand for new vehicles that are manufactured with our products. The level of new vehicle purchases is cyclical, affected by such factors as general economic conditions, interest rates, consumer confidence, consumer preferences, patterns of consumer spending, fuel costs and the automobile replacement cycle.\nThe global economic crisis that prevailed throughout 2008 and 2009 resulted in delayed and reduced purchases of durable consumer goods, such as automobiles. Although the global economic climate has improved since 2009, if the global economy were to take another significant downturn, depending upon its length, duration and severity, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow would again be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is cyclical in nature and downturns in the automotive industry could reduce the sales and profitability of its business.\nThe demand for our products is largely dependent on the North American production of automobiles. The markets for our products have been cyclical, because new vehicle demand is dependent on, among other things, consumer spending and is tied closely to the overall strength of the economy. Because our products are used principally in the production of vehicles for the automotive market, our net sales, and therefore results of operations, are significantly dependent on the general state of the economy and other factors which affect these markets. A decline in vehicle production would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the North American automotive market experienced a downturn during 2008\nand 2009 as a result of general weakness in the North American economy. Although North American vehicle production continued to recover in 2016, the rate of growth in production and sales in 2016 slowed from prior year periods. We cannot provide any assurance as to the level of growth in our markets. If the market stagnates or if there is any extended downturn, it could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are a holding company with no operations of our own, and we depend on our subsidiaries for cash to fund all of our operations and expenses, including to make future dividend payments, if any.\nOur operations are conducted entirely through our subsidiaries and our ability to generate cash to fund all of our operations and expenses and to pay dividends or to meet any debt service obligations of the holding company is highly dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries via dividends or intercompany loans. We currently expect to continue to pay dividends on our common stock; however, none of our subsidiaries will be obligated to make funds available to us for the payment of dividends. Further, the agreement governing our senior credit facility, for which our subsidiary, Unique Fabricating NA, Inc. is the borrower, restricts the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends, make loans or otherwise transfer assets to it. In addition, the laws of the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries are organized may impose requirements that may restrict the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends to us.\nWe may pursue acquisitions that involve inherent risks, any of which may cause us to not realize anticipated benefits.\nOur business strategy includes the potential acquisition of businesses that we expect will complement and expand our business. For example, during the last three fiscal years, we acquired the businesses and substantially all of the assets of PTI, Chardan, Great Lakes, and Intasco. We may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities or complete any particular acquisition, combination or other transaction on acceptable terms. Our identification of suitable acquisition candidates involves risks inherent in assessing the values, strengths, weaknesses, risks and profitability of these opportunities, including their effects on our business, diversion of our management\u2019s attention and risks associated with unanticipated problems or unforeseen liabilities. If we are successful in pursuing future acquisitions, we may be required to expend significant funds, incur additional debt, or issue additional shares of common stock, which may materially and adversely affect our results of operations and be dilutive to our stockholders. If we spend significant funds or incur additional debt, our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decline and we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures. In addition, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to finance additional acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that we complete. Should we successfully acquire other businesses, the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing business. Our failure to identify suitable acquisition opportunities may restrict our ability to grow our business.\nWe may experience increased costs and other disruptions to our business associated with labor unions.\nAs of January 1, 2017, we had 913 full-time employees, of whom 686 are hourly and 227 are salaried. 159 of our hourly employees are represented by labor unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements. A collective bargaining agreement covering 131 hourly workers employed at our Auburn Hills, Michigan facility terminates in August 2019. We cannot assure you that we will negotiate successfully a new collective bargaining agreement in our Auburn Hills facility, or other of our employees will not be represented by a labor organization in the future or that any of our facilities will not experience a work stoppage or other labor disruption. Many of our customers and their suppliers also have unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slow-downs experienced by customers or their other suppliers could result in slow-downs or closures of assembly plants where our products are included in assembled commercial vehicles. Any work stoppage or other labor disruption involving our employees, employees of our customers (many of which customers have employees who are represented by unions), or employees of our suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations by disrupting our ability to manufacture our products or reducing the demand for our products.\nWe would be adversely affected by the loss of key personnel.\nOur success is dependent upon the continued services of our senior management team and other key employees. Although certain key members of our senior management have employment agreements for their continued services, there is no guaranty that each such person will choose to remain with us. The loss of any key employees (including such members of our senior management team) could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, our success depends in part on our ability to attract, hire, train and retain qualified managerial, engineering, sales and marketing personnel. We face significant competition for these types of employees in our industry. We may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require to conduct our operations successfully. The loss of any\nmember of our senior management team or other key employees could impair our ability to execute our business plans and strategic initiatives, cause us to lose customers and experience reduced net sales, or lead to employee morale problems and/or the loss of other key employees. In any such event, our financial condition, results of operations, internal control over financial reporting, or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur results of operations may be negatively impacted by product liability lawsuits and claims.\nOur automotive products expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture, sale and use of our products. While we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms, that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities or that our insurance providers will successfully weather the current economic downturn. One or more successful claims against us could materially and adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur businesses are subject to statutory environmental and safety regulations in multiple jurisdictions, and the impact of any changes in regulation and/or the violation of any applicable laws and regulations by our businesses could result in a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and occupational health and safety, including laws regulating: air emissions; wastewater discharges; the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the soil, ground or air; and the health and safety of our employees. We are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. We cannot assure you that we are, or have been, in complete compliance with such environmental and safety laws, regulations and permits. If we violate or fail to comply with these laws, regulations or permits, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. In some instances, such a fine or sanction could have a material and adverse effect on us. The environmental laws to which we are subject have become more stringent over time, and we could incur material expenses in the future to comply with environmental laws. We are also subject to laws imposing liability for the cleanup of contaminated property. Under these laws, we could be held liable for costs and damages relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third party sites to which we sent waste containing hazardous substances. The amount of such liability could be material.\nCertain of our operations generate hazardous substances and wastes. If a release of such substances or wastes occurs at or from our properties, or at or from any offsite disposal location to which substances or wastes from our current or former operations were taken, or if contamination is discovered at any of our current or former properties, we may be held liable for the costs of cleanup and for any other claim by governmental authorities or private parties, together with any associated fines, penalties or damages. In most jurisdictions, this liability would arise whether or not we had complied with environmental laws governing the handling of hazardous substances or wastes.\nWe may be adversely affected by the impact of government regulations on our customers.\nAlthough the products we manufacture and supply to vehicle customers are not subject to significant government regulation, our business is indirectly impacted by the extensive governmental regulation applicable to vehicle customers. These regulations primarily relate to emissions and noise standards imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, state regulatory agencies, such as the California Air Resources Board, or CARB, and other regulatory agencies around the world. Vehicle customers are also subject to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act and Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards promulgated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Changes in emission standards and other proposed governmental regulations could impact the demand for vehicles and, as a result, indirectly impact our operations. For example, emission standards governing heavy-duty (Class 8) diesel engines that went into effect in the United States on October 1, 2002 and January 1, 2007 resulted in significant purchases of new trucks by fleet operators prior to such date and reduced short term demand for such trucks in periods immediately following such date. Emission standards for truck engines used in Class 5 to 8 trucks imposed by the EPA and CARB became effective in 2010. To the extent that current or future governmental regulation has a negative impact on the demand for vehicles, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have only limited protection for our proprietary rights in our intellectual property, which makes it difficult to prevent third parties from infringing upon our rights.\nOur success depends to a certain degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. We have not been issued patents and have not registered trademarks with respect to\nour products. Our competitors could duplicate our designs, processes or other intellectual property or design around any processes or designs on which we may obtain patents or trademark protection in the future. In addition, it is possible that third parties may have or acquire patents, trademarks, or licenses for other technology or designs that we may use or desire to use, so that we may need to acquire licenses to, or to contest the validity of, such patents or trademarks of third parties. Such licenses may not be made available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, and we may not prevail in contesting the validity of third party rights.\nWe protect trade secrets, know-how and other confidential information against unauthorized use by others or disclosure by persons who have access to them, such as our employees, through contractual or other arrangements. These arrangements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies, our revenues could be materially adversely affected.\nWe believe any attempt by President Trump to withdraw from or materially modify NAFTA and certain other international trade agreements could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries, including Mexico. President Trump has made comments suggesting that he was not supportive of certain existing international trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d). At this time, it remains unclear what President Trump would or would not do with respect to these international trade agreements. If President-elect Trump takes action to withdraw from or materially modify NAFTA or certain other international trade agreements, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nWe may not be able to pay dividends.\nWe have paid and currently plan to pay dividends quarterly. However, our ability to pay dividends will be affected by our results and our needs for funds for use in our operations and to expand our business. In addition, our senior secured credit facility contains covenants which restrict or limit the amounts that we can pay as dividends or preclude the payments of dividends altogether.\nIf our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders choose to act together, they will be able to exert significant influence over us and our significant corporate decisions and may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders.\nOur executive officers, directors, and beneficial owners of 5% or more of our outstanding common stock and their affiliates beneficially own approximately 32.5% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these persons, if they were to act together, have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and they could act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, by among other things:\n\u2022\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us;\n\u2022\nentrenching our management and/or our board of directors;\n\u2022\nimpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us;\n\u2022\ndiscouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us; or\n\u2022\ncausing us to enter into transactions or agreements that are not in the best interests of all stockholders.\nSecurities analysts may not initiate or continue coverage of our common stock or may issue negative reports, which may have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock.\nTo date since our initial public offering, there has been limited coverage of our common stock by securities analysts. Securities analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our common stock. If securities analysts do not cover our common stock, the lack of research coverage may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, or adversely affect the trading volume for our common stock. The trading market for our common stock may be affected in part by the research\nand reports that industry or financial analysts publish about our business. If one or more of the analysts who elect to cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline rapidly. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline. In addition, under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and a global settlement among the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, other regulatory agencies and a number of investment banks, which was reached in 2003, many investment banking firms are required to contract with independent financial analysts for their stock research. It may be difficult for a company such as ours, with a smaller market capitalization, to attract independent financial analysts that will cover our common stock. This could have a negative effect on the market price of and trading volume for our stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market may cause our stock price to decline and impair our ability to raise future capital through the sale of our equity securities.\nAs of January 1, 2017, we had outstanding 9,719,772 shares of common stock, including 2,702,500 shares of our common stock issued in our initial public offering and 6,691,760 shares of common stock owned by non-affiliates and issued in private placements, in each case more than one year ago. The shares owned by non-affiliates can be traded without restriction under Rule 144 or otherwise at this time. In addition, 3,028,012 shares of common stock are owned by affiliates but can be traded subject to restrictions under Rule 144. In addition, we have registered all shares that may be issued pursuant to our 2013 Stock Incentive Plan and the 2014 Omnibus Performance Award Plan. Sales of a large number of these securities on the public market or the perception that a large number of shares may be sold could reduce the market price of our common stock or impair our ability to raise capital.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change in control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company or changes in our board of directors that our stockholders might consider favorable, including transactions in which you might receive a premium for your shares. These provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. Stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so. Furthermore, these provisions could prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove management. These provisions:\n\u2022\nallow the authorized number of directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide for a classified board of directors, such that not all members of our board will be elected at one time;\n\u2022\nprohibit our stockholders from filling board vacancies, limit who may call stockholder meetings, and prohibit the taking of stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022\nrequire advance written notice of stockholder proposals that can be acted upon at stockholders meetings and of director nominations to our board of directors.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. Any delay or prevention of a change in control transaction or changes in our board of directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nRISKS RELATED TO PUBLIC COMPANIES\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act of 2012 and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and (3) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those\nstandards apply to private companies. We have elected to delay such adoption of new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies that comply with all public company accounting standards.\nWe may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. Under the JOBS Act, we may be able to maintain emerging growth company status for up to five years following our initial public offering, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our second quarter during any fiscal year before the end of such five-year period or if we have total annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion or more during any fiscal year before that time, in which cases we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. Additionally, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during any three-year period before that time, we would cease to be an emerging growth company immediately. Even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive because of our reliance on any of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and otherwise adversely impact our business.\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, has promulgated final rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act regarding disclosure of the use of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, known as conflict minerals, in products manufactured by public companies. These new rules require ongoing due diligence to determine whether such minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo, or the DRC, or an adjoining country and whether such minerals helped finance the armed conflict in the DRC. Reporting obligations for the rule began May 31, 2014 and are required annually thereafter. We will be required to comply with the reporting obligations beginning after our fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. There will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs to determine the origin of conflict minerals in our products. The implementation of these rules and their effect on customer, supplier and/or consumer behavior could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. As a result, we may also incur costs with respect to potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply. We may face disqualification as a supplier for customers and reputational challenges if the due diligence procedures we implement do not enable us to verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products or to determine if such conflict minerals are conflict-free. Accordingly, the implementation of these rules could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of being a public company, and potentially will incur more after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d. Our management devotes substantial time to public company compliance programs, and will be required to continue to devote substantial time in the future.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, insurance, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, our administrative staff is required to perform additional tasks. We expect that these expenses will increase when we no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d. We have invested and intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment has resulted in increased general and administrative expenses and may divert management\u2019s time and attention from product development and commercialization activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be harmed. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to maintain the listing of our common stock on the NYSE MKT which would likely have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nIn the future, it may be more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit and compensation committees.\nOur internal control over financial reporting as a public company now requires us to meet the standards required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and failure to achieve and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in\naccordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could result in material misstatements of our annual or interim financial statements and have a material adverse effect on our business and share price.\nWe are now currently required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and are therefore required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. This requires management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment will need to include the disclosure of any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting identified by our management or our independent registered public accounting firm. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A \u201csignificant deficiency\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of our financial reporting, including the audit committee of the board of directors.\nFinally, as a public company we believe that we will need to continue to expand our accounting resources, including the size and expertise of our internal accounting team, to effectively execute a quarterly close process and on an appropriate time frame for a public company. If we are unsuccessful or unable to sufficiently expand these resources, we may not be able to produce U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)-compliant financial statements on a time frame required to comply with our reporting requirements under the Exchange Act, and the financial statements we produce may contain material misstatements, either of which could cause investors to lose confidence in our financial reports and our financial reporting generally, which could lead to a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nWe may pursue acquisitions that involve inherent risks related to potential internal control weaknesses and significant deficiencies which may be costly for us to remedy and could impact management assessment of internal control effectiveness.\nWe have acquired companies recently that have small accounting and finance staff increasing the potential for material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in financial reporting at the stand alone or subsidiary entity level. Although our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to our internal control effectiveness while we are an emerging growth company, management is still responsible for assessing internal control effectiveness at a consolidated level. As we integrate these acquired companies into our business, the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations with entities that potentially have material weaknesses and/or significant deficiencies may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources to remedy and material weaknesses or significant deficiencies that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing business. These potential material weaknesses and deficiencies may be costly for us to remedy properly and properly assess internal control effectiveness.", "PERMNO": 15590, "SIC": 3714, "TIC": "UFAB"}
