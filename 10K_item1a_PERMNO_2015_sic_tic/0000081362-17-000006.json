{"cik": "81362", "company": "QUAKER CHEMICAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nChanges to the industries and markets that Quaker serves could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nThe business environment in which the Company operates remains uncertain. The Company is subject to the same business cycles as those experienced by steel, automobile, aircraft, appliance, and durable goods manufacturers. A major risk is that demand for the Company\u2019s products and services is largely derived from the global demand for its customers\u2019 products, which subjects the Company to uncertainties related to downturns in our customers\u2019 business and unanticipated shutdowns or curtailments of our customers\u2019 production. The Company has limited ability to adjust its cost level contemporaneously with changes in sales and gross margins. Thus, a significant downturn in sales or gross margins due to reductions in global production within the industries the Company serves and/or weak end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position, and results of operations.\nChanges in competition in the industries and markets Quaker serves could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position, and results of operations.\nThe specialty chemical industry comprises a number of companies of similar size as well as companies larger and smaller than Quaker. It is estimated that Quaker holds a leading and significant global position in the markets for process fluids to produce sheet steel, and significant global positions in portions of the automotive and industrial markets. These industries are highly competitive, and a number of companies with significant financial resources and/or customer relationships compete with us to provide similar products and services. Our competitors may be positioned to offer more favorable pricing and service terms, potentially resulting in reduced profitability and/or a loss of market share for us. In addition, several competitors could potentially consolidate their businesses to gain scale to better position their product offerings, which could have a negative impact on our profitability and market share. Historically, competition in the industry has been based primarily on the ability to provide products that meet the needs of the customer and render technical services and laboratory assistance to the customer and, to a lesser extent, on price. Factors critical to the Company\u2019s business include successfully differentiating the Company\u2019s offerings from its competition, operating efficiently and profitably as a globally integrated Company, and increasing market share and customer penetration through internally developed business programs and strategic acquisitions. If the Company is unsuccessful with differentiation, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position, and results of operations.\nOur business depends on attracting and retaining qualified management and other key personnel.\nThe unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team or other key personnel could have an adverse effect on our business. Given the relative size of the Company and the breadth of its global operations, there are a limited number of qualified personnel to assume the responsibilities of management level or other key employees. In addition, because of the specialized and technical nature of our business, our future performance is dependent on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified management, commercial, technical, and other key personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel. In an effort to mitigate such risks, the Company utilizes retention bonuses, offers competitive pay and maintains continuous succession planning, but there can be no assurance that these mitigating factors will be adequate to attract or retain qualified management or other key personnel.\nInability to obtain sufficient price increases or contract concessions to offset increases in the costs of raw materials could result in a loss of sales, gross margin, and/or market share and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations. Conversely, an inability to implement timely price decreases to compensate for changes in raw material costs could result in a loss of sales, gross margin, and/or market share and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nQuaker uses over 1,000 various raw materials, including mineral oils and derivatives, animal fats and derivatives, vegetable oils and derivatives, ethylene derivatives, solvents, surface active agents, and a wide variety of other organic and inorganic compounds. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, three raw material groups (mineral oils and derivatives, animal fats and derivatives, and vegetable oils and derivatives) each accounted for approximately 6% to 15% of the total cost of Quaker\u2019s raw material purchases, and in the aggregate, these three raw material groups accounted for approximately one third of the total cost of\nQuaker\u2019s raw material purchases during each period. The price of mineral oils and derivatives can be affected by crude oil pricing and industry refining capacity. Animal fat and vegetable oil prices also can be impacted by biodiesel consumption which is affected by the price of crude oil. In addition, many of the raw materials used by Quaker are \u201ccommodity\u201d chemicals, which can experience significant price volatility. Accordingly, Quaker\u2019s earnings can be impacted by market changes in raw material prices.\nAlthough the Company has been successful in the past in recovering a substantial amount of the raw material cost increases while retaining its customers, there can be no assurance that the Company can continue to recover higher raw material costs or retain customers in the future. Conversely, the Company has been successful in maintaining acceptable levels of margin in periods of raw material price decline, but there can be no assurance that the Company can continue to maintain its margins through appropriate price and contract concessions, while retaining its customers in the future. As a result of the Company\u2019s past pricing actions, in periods of rising and declining costs, customers may become more likely to consider competitors\u2019 products, some of which may be available at a lower cost. A significant loss of customers could result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position, and results of operations.\nLack of availability of raw materials and issues associated with sourcing from some single suppliers and some suppliers in volatile economic environments could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nThe chemical specialty industry can experience tightness of supply for certain raw materials. In addition, in some cases, we source from a single supplier and/or suppliers in economies that have experienced instability. Any significant disruption in supply could affect our ability to obtain raw materials, or increase the cost of such raw materials, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position and results of operations. In addition, certain raw materials that the Company uses are subject to various regulatory laws, and a change in the ability to legally use such raw materials may impact Quaker\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nLoss of a significant manufacturing facility may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nQuaker has multiple manufacturing facilities throughout the world. In certain countries, such as Brazil and China, there is only one such facility. If one of the Company\u2019s facilities is damaged to such an extent that production is halted for an extended period, the Company may not be able to timely supply its customers. This could result in a loss of sales over an extended period, or permanently. The Company does take steps to mitigate against this risk, including business continuity and contingency planning and procuring property and casualty insurance (including business interruption insurance). Nevertheless, the loss of sales in any one region over any extended period of time could have a significant material adverse effect on Quaker\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nLoss of a significant customer, bankruptcy of a major customer, or the closure of a customer site could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nDuring 2016, our five largest customers (each composed of multiple subsidiaries or divisions with semi-autonomous purchasing authority) together accounted for approximately 19% of our consolidated net sales, with the largest customer accounting for approximately 8% of our consolidated net sales. The loss of a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on Quaker\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operation.\nAlso, a significant portion of Quaker\u2019s revenues is derived from sales to customers in the steel and automotive industries; including some of our larger customers, where a number of bankruptcies have occurred in the past and where companies have experienced financial difficulties. As part of a bankruptcy process, the Company\u2019s pre-petition receivables may not be realized and customer manufacturing sites may be closed or contracts voided. The bankruptcy of a major customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations. Also, steel customers typically have limited manufacturing locations compared to metalworking customers and generally use higher volumes of products at a single location. The loss or closure of one or more steel mills or other major sites of a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on Quaker\u2019s business.\nImpairment evaluations of goodwill, intangible assets, investments or other long-lived assets could result in a reduction in our recorded asset values, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operation.\nThe Company performs reviews of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis, or more frequently if triggering events indicate a possible impairment. The Company tests goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the unit's fair value. Similarly, the Company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying values. If the carrying values of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceed their fair value, the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may be considered impaired. In addition, the Company will perform a review of a definite-lived intangible asset or other long-lived asset when changes in circumstances or events indicate a possible impairment. An estimate of undiscounted cash flows produced by the asset or appropriate group of assets is compared with its carrying value to determine if an impairment charge is warranted. If any impairment or related charge is warranted, then Quaker\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations could be materially affected.\nFluctuations in our effective tax rate could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operation.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions; with our domestic and international tax liabilities being subject to the allocation of income among these different jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of local tax rates, applicable to the Company, in the various countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate and respective tax liabilities could, therefore, be materially affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax rates, expiration or lapses of tax credits or incentives, changes in uncertain tax positions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws, including matters such as transfer pricing. In addition, we are regularly under audit by tax authorities, and the final decisions of such audits could materially affect our current tax estimates and tax positions. Any of these factors, or similar tax-related risks, could cause the Company to experience an effective tax rate and tax-related payments that significantly differ from previous periods or current expectations, which could have a significant material effect on Quaker\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with any material provision of our primary credit facility or other debt agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nThe Company's primary credit facility is a $300 million unsecured multicurrency credit agreement with a group of lenders which matures in June 2018. The amount available under this facility can be increased to $400 million at the Company's option if lenders agree to increase their commitments and the Company satisfies certain conditions. This facility provides the availability of revolving credit borrowings, and, in general, bears interest at either a base rate or LIBOR plus a margin based on the Company's consolidated leverage ratio.\nThe facility contains covenants that impose certain restrictions, including limitations on investments, acquisitions and liens, as well as default provisions customary for facilities of its type. While these covenants and restrictions are not currently considered to be overly restrictive, they could become more difficult to comply with as our business or financial conditions change. In addition, deterioration in the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial position could significantly increase borrowing costs.\nQuaker is exposed to market rate risk for changes in interest rates due to the variable interest rate applied to the Company\u2019s borrowings under its credit facilities. Accordingly, if interest rates rise significantly, the cost of debt to Quaker will increase, perhaps significantly, depending on the extent and timing of Quaker\u2019s borrowings under the credit facilities. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $47.9 million in outstanding borrowings under its credit facilities. Incorporated by reference is the interest rate risk information contained in Item 7A of this Report.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations and/or pending and future legal proceedings may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position, and results of operations, as well as its reputation in the markets it serves.\nThe Company is a party to proceedings, cases, and requests for information from, and negotiations with, various claimants and federal and state agencies relating to various matters, including environmental matters. An adverse result in one or more pending or on-going matters or any potential future matter of a similar nature could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position, and results of operations, as well as its reputation in the markets it serves. Incorporated herein by reference is the information concerning pending asbestos-related litigation against an inactive subsidiary, amounts accrued associated with certain environmental, non-capital remediation costs and other potential commitments or contingencies highlighted in Note 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appears in Item 8 of this Report.\nFailure to comply with the complex global regulatory environment in which the Company operates could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s reputation and/or a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nChanges in the regulatory environment in which the Company operates, particularly, but not limited to, the United States, Mexico, Brazil, China, India and the European Union, could lead to heightened regulatory scrutiny, could adversely impact our ability to continue selling certain products in our domestic or foreign markets and/or could increase the cost of doing business. For instance, the European Union\u2019s Registration, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (\u201cREACH\u201d), and analogous non-E.U. laws and regulations or other similar laws and regulations, could result in the inability to continue selling certain non-compliant products, fines, ongoing monitoring and other future business consequences, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations. In addition, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, particularly the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act and other similar laws and regulations, could result in a negative impact to the Company\u2019s reputation, potential fines or ongoing monitoring, which could also have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position, and results of operations.\nPotential product, service or other related liability claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nThe development, manufacture and sale of specialty chemical products and other related services involve inherent exposure to potential product liability claims, service level claims, product recalls and related adverse publicity. Any of these potential product or service risks could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures and affect customer confidence in our products and services,\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations. Although the Company maintains product and other general liability insurance, there can be no assurance that the types or levels of coverage maintained are adequate to cover these potential risks. In addition, the Company may not be able to continue to maintain its existing insurance coverage or obtain comparable or additional insurance coverage at a reasonable cost, if at all, in the event a significant product or service claim arises.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights and trade brands, which may limit the Company\u2019s ability to compete in its markets.\nQuaker has a limited number of patents and patent applications, including patents issued, applied for, or acquired in the United States and in various foreign countries, some of which may prove to be material to its business. Principal reliance is placed upon Quaker\u2019s proprietary formulae and the application of its skills and experience to meet customer needs. Also, Quaker\u2019s products are identified by trademarks that are registered throughout its marketed area. Despite our efforts to protect such proprietary information through patent and trademark filings, through the use of appropriate trade secret protections and through the inability of certain products to be effectively replicated by others, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, use or disclose our technologies, products, and processes. In addition, the laws and/or judicial systems of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology or trade brands. Also, security over our global information technology structure is subject to increasing risks associated with cyber-crime and other affiliated cyber-security threats. These potential risks to our proprietary information and trade brands could subject the Company to increased competition and negatively impact our liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nWe might not be able to timely develop, manufacture and gain market acceptance of new and enhanced products required to maintain or expand our business.\nWe believe that our continued success depends on our ability to continuously develop and manufacture new products and product enhancements on a timely and cost-effective basis, in response to customers\u2019 demands for higher performance process chemicals, coatings, greases and other product offerings. Our competitors may develop new products or enhancements to their products that offer performance, features and lower prices that may render our products less competitive or obsolete, and, as a consequence, we may lose business and/or significant market share. The development and commercialization of new products require significant expenditures over an extended period of time, and some products that we seek to develop may never become profitable. In addition, we may not be able to develop and introduce products incorporating new technologies in a timely manner that will satisfy our customers\u2019 future needs or achieve market acceptance.\nAn inability to appropriately capitalize on growth, including prior acquisitions, organic growth, or future acquisitions, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial position and results of operations.\nQuaker has completed several acquisitions over the past several years and may continue to seek acquisitions to grow its business in the future. The success of the Company\u2019s growth depends on its ability to successfully integrate these acquisitions, including, but not limited to its ability to do the following:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully execute the integration or consolidation of the acquired or additional business into existing processes and operations;\n\u2022\ndevelop or modify financial reporting, information systems and other related financial tools to ensure overall financial integrity and adequacy of internal control procedures;\n\u2022\nidentify and take advantage of potential synergies, including cost reduction opportunities, while maintaining legacy business and other related attributes; and\n\u2022\nfurther penetrate existing, and expand into new, markets with the product capabilities acquired in acquisitions.\nIn addition, the Company continues to grow organically through increased end-market growth, incremental market share gains, and extending acquired technologies through its existing channels. Such growth is dependent on prevailing market conditions and the Company\u2019s ability to execute over time.\nTherefore, the Company may fail to derive significant benefits or may not create the appropriate infrastructure to support such additional growth from organic or acquired businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on Quaker\u2019s liquidity, financial position, and results of operations.\nThe scope of our international operations subjects the Company to risks including, but not limited to, risks from currency fluctuations, changes in trade regulations, political and economic instability, and complex local tax environments.\nSince significant revenues and earnings are generated by non-U.S. operations, Quaker\u2019s financial results are affected by currency fluctuations, particularly between the U.S. dollar and the euro, the Brazilian real, the Mexican peso, the Chinese renminbi, and the Indian rupee, and the impact of those currency fluctuations on the underlying economies. During the past three years, sales by non-U.S. subsidiaries accounted for approximately 60% of our consolidated net sales. Generally, all of the Company\u2019s operations use their local currency as their functional currency. The Company generally does not use financial instruments that expose it to significant risk involving foreign currency transactions; however, the relative size of its non-U.S. activities has a significant impact on reported operating results and the Company\u2019s net assets. Therefore, as exchange rates vary, Quaker\u2019s results can be materially affected.\nIncorporated by reference is the foreign exchange risk information contained in Item 7A of this Report and the geographic information in Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nThe Company sources inventory among its worldwide operations occasionally. This practice can give rise to foreign exchange risk resulting from the varying cost of inventory to the receiving location, as well as from the revaluation of intercompany balances. The Company mitigates this risk through local sourcing efforts in the majority of its locations.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company held approximately $86.9 million of its total cash and cash equivalents in its non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company can access this cash without restriction, however, it is subject to possible risks related to currency fluctuations, tax-related impacts and other potential events due to cash being held outside of the United States.\nAdditional risks associated with the Company\u2019s international operations include, but are not limited to: instability in economic conditions from country to country; changes in a country\u2019s political situation; trade protection measures; longer customer payment cycles; different payment practices such as the use of banker acceptance drafts or other similar credit instruments; licensing and other legal requirements; the difficulties of staffing and managing dispersed international operations; less protective foreign intellectual property laws; legal systems that may be less developed and predictable than those in the United States; and complex and dynamic local tax regulations.\nDisruption of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems may adversely affect our business and our customer relationships.\nQuaker relies on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. The Company also relies on its technology infrastructure, among other functions, to interact with customers and suppliers, fulfill orders and bill, collect and make payments, ship products, provide support to customers, fulfill contractual obligations and otherwise conduct business. Our information technology systems are subject to potential disruptions, including significant network or power outages, cyberattacks, computer viruses, other malicious codes, and/or unauthorized access attempts, any of which, if successful, could result in data leaks or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Cybersecurity incidents, such as these, are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and there can be no assurance that our protective measures will prevent security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business, reputation and financial results. Failure to monitor, maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity effectively or, to anticipate, plan for and recover from significant disruptions to these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nTerrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war, natural disasters or other uncommon global events may affect the markets in which we operate and our profitability.\nTerrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war, natural disasters or other uncommon global events may negatively affect our operations. There can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the U.S. or other locations where we do business. Also, other uncommon global events such as earthquakes, fires and tsunamis cannot be predicted. Terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or armed conflicts, and natural disasters may directly impact our physical facilities and/or those of our suppliers or customers. Additional terrorist attacks or natural disasters may disrupt the global insurance and reinsurance industries with the result that we may not be able to obtain insurance at historical terms and levels, if at all, for all of our facilities. Furthermore, any of these events may make travel and the transportation of our supplies and products more difficult and more expensive and ultimately affect the sales of our products. The consequences of terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or armed conflicts, natural disasters or other uncommon global events can be unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events, such as these, that could have a material adverse effect on our business.", "PERMNO": 64929, "SIC": 2990, "TIC": "KWR"}
