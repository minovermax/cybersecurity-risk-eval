We believe the risks described below identify the material risks we face. However, the risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional unknown risks, or risks that we currently consider immaterial, may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our shares of Class A Common Stock could decline significantly. Investors should consider the specific risk factors discussed below, together with other information contained in this report on Form 10-K and the other documents that we will file from time to time with the SEC.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe instruments governing our indebtedness contain various covenants limiting the conduct of our business.\nOur credit agreement, the indentures governing our senior notes and the instruments governing our other indebtedness and our Series A Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock (\"Preferred Stock\") contain various restrictive covenants that limit the conduct of our business and our credit agreements require us to maintain certain financial ratios. These covenants and restrictions limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions and may prevent us from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be considered beneficial to us. In particular, this agreement places certain limits on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and lease back transactions;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\npay dividends or distributions;\n\u2022\nmake certain restricted payments;\n\u2022\nconsummate certain asset sales;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nmerge, consolidate and/or sell or dispose of all, or substantially all, of our assets.\nIf we fail to comply with the restrictions in our credit agreement, the indentures governing our senior notes, or the instruments governing our other indebtedness or any other subsequent financing agreements, a default may allow the creditors, if the agreements so provide, to accelerate the related indebtedness as well as any other indebtedness to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. If that occurs, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance such debt. Even if new financing were available at that time, it may not be available on terms acceptable to us.\nIf we are unable to repay amounts outstanding under our credit agreement when due, the lenders thereunder could, subject to the terms of the agreement, seek to sell or otherwise transfer our assets granted to them as collateral to secure the indebtedness outstanding under the agreement. Substantially all of our assets have been pledged as collateral to secure our credit agreement. Substantially all of the assets of HFOTCO have been pledged as collateral to secure the indebtedness of HFOTCO. In addition, the lenders under our credit agreement and the HFOTCO credit agreement could choose to terminate any commitments to supply us with further funds.\nUnder certain economic conditions, our access to capital and credit markets may be limited, which may adversely impact our liquidity.\nWe may require additional funds from outside sources from time to time. Our ability to raise capital or arrange financing or renew existing facilities, along with the cost of such capital, is dependent upon a number of variables, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, financial and business conditions;\n\u2022\nindustry specific conditions;\n\u2022\nprevailing interest rates;\n\u2022\ncredit availability from banks and other financial institutions;\n\u2022\ninvestor confidence in us;\n\u2022\ncash flow and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") levels;\n\u2022\ncompetitive, legislative and regulatory matters; and\n\u2022\nprovisions of tax and securities laws that may impact raising capital.\nIn addition, volatility in the capital markets may adversely affect our ability to access any available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our access to these funds is dependent on the ability of the lenders to meet their funding obligations under this revolving facility. Lenders may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity, resulting in a reduction of our available borrowing capacity.\nOur substantial indebtedness could limit our flexibility, adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from making payments on such indebtedness.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for operations and other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to maintain or increase the dividends we pay to holders of our Class A common stock\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that may have proportionately less indebtedness.\nIn addition, our ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance. We cannot assure you that our operating performance will generate sufficient cash flow or that our capital resources will be sufficient for payment of our debt obligations in the future. Our financial and operating performance, cash flow and capital resources depend on prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIf our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. In the event that we are required to dispose of material assets or operations or restructure our debt to meet our debt service and other obligations, we cannot assure you as to the terms of any such transaction or how quickly any such transaction could be completed, if at all.\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Our incurrence of additional indebtedness would intensify the risks described above.\nThe Preferred Stock gives the holders thereof liquidation and distribution preferences, certain rights relating to our business and management, and the ability to convert such shares into our Class A common stock, potentially causing dilution to our common stockholders.\nIn January 2018, we issued 350,000 shares of Preferred Stock (the \u201cPreferred Shares\u201d), which rank senior to the Class A common stock with respect to distribution rights and rights upon liquidation. Subject to certain exceptions, so long as any Preferred Shares remain outstanding, we may not declare any dividend or distribution on our Class A common stock unless all accumulated and unpaid dividends have been declared and paid (in cash or in kind) on the Preferred Shares. In the event of our\nliquidation, winding-up or dissolution, the holders of the Preferred Shares would have the right to receive proceeds from any such transaction before the holders of the Class A common stock. The payment of the liquidation preference could result in common stockholders not receiving any consideration if we were to liquidate, dissolve or wind up, either voluntarily or involuntarily. Additionally, the existence of the liquidation preference may reduce the value of the Class A common stock, make it harder for us to sell shares of Class A common stock in offerings in the future, or prevent or delay a change of control.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Preferred Shares, we entered into an agreement with WP SemGroup Holdings, LP (\u201cWarburg\u201d), an entity controlled by funds affiliated with Warburg Pincus LLC, pursuant to which we granted Warburg the right to appoint an observer to our Board of Directors. In addition, the Certificate of Designations governing the Preferred Shares provides the holders of the Preferred Shares with the right to vote on an as-converted basis with our common stockholders on matters submitted to a stockholder vote. Also, so long as any Preferred Shares are outstanding, subject to certain exceptions, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Preferred Shares, voting together as a separate class, will be necessary for effecting or validating, among other things: (i) any issuance of stock senior to the Preferred Shares, (ii) any issuance by us of parity stock, subject to certain exceptions, (iii) any repurchase by us of any Preferred Stock, other than on a pro rata basis among all Holders, (iv) any special, one-time dividend or distribution with respect to any class of junior stock and (v) any spin-off or other distribution of any equity securities or assets of any of our subsidiaries to its stockholders in which the consideration received by us in such transaction is less than fair market value, subject to certain exceptions. These restrictions may adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities.\nFurthermore, the conversion of the Preferred Shares into Class A common stock beginning on or after the eighteen-month anniversary of the issuance of the Preferred Shares, may cause substantial dilution to holders of the Class A common stock. Because our Board of Directors is entitled to designate the powers and preferences of preferred stock without a vote of our Class A common stockholders, subject to NYSE rules and regulations, our Class A common stockholders will have no control over what designations and preferences our future preferred stock, if any, will have.\nOur profitability depends on the demand for the products we gather, transport, process and store in the markets we serve.\nAny sustained reduction in demand for petroleum products in markets served by our midstream assets could result in a significant reduction in the volume of petroleum products that we gather, transport, process and store, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. A reduction in demand can result from a number of factors including:\n\u2022\nan increase in the price of products derived from petroleum products;\n\u2022\nhigher taxes, including federal excise taxes, crude oil severance taxes or sales taxes or other governmental or regulatory actions that increase, directly or indirectly, the cost of petroleum based products;\n\u2022\nadverse economic conditions which result in lower spending by consumers and businesses on products derived from petroleum products;\n\u2022\neffects of weather, natural phenomena, terrorism, war, or other similar acts;\n\u2022\nan increase in fuel economy, whether as a result of a shift by consumers to more fuel efficient vehicles, technological advances by manufacturers or federal or state regulations;\n\u2022\nincreasing levels of congestion in the Houston Ship Channel could result in a diversion of business to less busy ports;\n\u2022\ndecision by our customers or suppliers to use alternate service providers for a portion of or all of their needs, operate in different markets not served by us, reduce operations or cease operations entirely; and\n\u2022\nan increase in the use of alternative fuel sources such as ethanol, biodiesel, fuel cells, solar and wind power.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of Meritage.\nOn February 25, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Meritage Midstream ULC. We believe that the Meritage acquisition will, among other things, expand and optimize our portfolio of assets and create a more attractive Canadian growth platform. However, our assessments and expectations regarding these anticipated benefits of the Meritage acquisition may prove to be incorrect. Accordingly, there can be no assurance we will realize the anticipated benefits of the Meritage acquisition.\nCertain of our operations are conducted through joint ventures which have unique risks.\nCertain of our operations are conducted through joint ventures. With respect to our joint ventures, we share ownership and management responsibilities with partners that may not share our goals and objectives. Differences in views among the partners may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major matters, such as large expenditures or contractual commitments, the construction or acquisition of assets or borrowing money, among others. Delay or failure to agree may prevent action with respect to such matters, even though such action may serve our best interest or that of the joint venture. Accordingly, delayed decisions and disagreements could adversely affect the business and operations of the joint ventures and, in turn, our business and operations.\nAn impairment of our assets, including goodwill, property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity-method investments, could reduce our earnings.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. require us to test certain assets for impairment on either an annual basis or when events or circumstances occur which indicate that the carrying value of such assets might be impaired. The outcome of such testing could result in impairments of our assets including our goodwill, property, plant, and equipment, intangible assets, and/or equity method investments. Additionally, any asset monetizations could result in impairments if any other assets are sold or otherwise exchanged for amounts less than their carrying value. If we determine that an impairment has occurred, we would be required to take an immediate non-cash charge to earnings.\nBecause of the natural decline in production from existing wells in our areas of operation, our success depends on our ability to obtain new sources of supply of petroleum products, which is dependent on factors beyond our control. Any decrease in the volumes of these products that we gather, transport, store, process or market could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe volumes that support our business are dependent, in part, on the level of production from wells connected to our operations, the production from which may be less than we expect as a result of a natural decline of producing wells over time and the shut-in of wells for economic or other reasons. As a result, in order to maintain or increase the amount of petroleum products that we handle, we must obtain new sources of petroleum products. The primary factors affecting our ability to obtain sources of these products include the level of successful drilling activity near our systems and our ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells.\nWe have no control over the level of drilling activity in our areas of operation, the amount of reserves associated with wells connected to our operations or the rate at which production from a well declines. In addition, we have no control over producers or their drilling or production decisions, which are affected by, among other things, the availability and cost of capital, prevailing and projected energy prices, demand for petroleum products, levels of reserves, geological considerations, environmental or other governmental regulations, the availability of drilling permits, the availability of drilling rigs, and other drilling, production and development costs.\nFluctuations in energy prices can also greatly affect the development of new petroleum product reserves and, to a lesser extent, production from existing wells. In general terms, energy prices fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Declines in energy prices have a negative impact on exploration, development and production activity and, if sustained, could lead to a material decrease in such activity. Sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in our areas of operation would lead to reduced utilization of our assets and a reduced need for our marketing operations. Because of these factors, even if new reserves are known to exist in areas served by our assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. If reductions in drilling activity result in our inability to maintain the levels of petroleum products that we handle, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur construction of new assets may not result in the anticipated revenue increases.\nOne of the ways we intend to continue to grow our business is through the construction of new assets. If we undertake such projects, they may not be completed on schedule or at the budgeted cost or at all. Moreover, our revenue may not increase immediately, or at all, upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, if we expand a pipeline, the construction may occur over an extended period of time and we may not receive any material increases in revenue until the project is completed. Moreover, we may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which such growth does not materialize. Since we are not engaged in the exploration for, and the development of, natural gas and crude oil reserves, we do not possess reserve expertise and we often do not have access to third-party estimates of potential reserves in an area prior to constructing facilities in such area. To the extent we rely on estimates of future production in our decision to construct additions to our system, such estimates may prove to be inaccurate because of numerous uncertainties\ninherent in estimating quantities of future production. As a result, new facilities may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve our expected investment return, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIncreased regulation of hydraulic fracturing or produced water disposal could result in reductions or delays in crude oil and natural gas production in our areas of operation, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nThe adoption of new laws or regulations imposing additional permitting, disclosures, restrictions or costs related to hydraulic fracturing or produced water disposal could make drilling certain wells less economically attractive. As a result, the volume of crude oil and natural gas we gather, transport and store for our customers could be substantially reduced which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nOur operations could be adversely affected if third-party pipelines, or other facilities connected to our facilities, become partially or fully unavailable, or if the volumes we gather do not meet the quality requirements of such pipelines or facilities.\nOur facilities connect to other pipelines or facilities, some of which are owned by third parties. The operation of such third-party pipelines or facilities is not within our control. These pipelines and other facilities may become unavailable, or available only at a reduced capacity, because of testing, turnarounds, line repair, reduced operating pressure, lack of operating capacity, curtailments of receipt or deliveries due to insufficient capacity, or for any other reason. If any of these pipelines or facilities becomes unable to transport the products we gather, or if the volumes we gather or transport do not meet the quality requirements of such pipelines or facilities, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur Risk Governance Policies' provisions governing our internal marketing activities cannot eliminate all risks associated with the marketing of commodities, nor can we ensure full compliance at all times with the Risk Governance Policies by our employees, both of which could impact our financial and operational results.\nWe have in place Risk Governance Policies that establish authorized commodities and transaction types, delegations of authority, and limits for marketing exposures and require that we restrict net open positions (e.g., positions that are not fully hedged as to commodity price risk) to specified levels at each of the consolidated and, in certain cases, subsidiary level. Our Risk Governance Policies have restrictive terms with respect to acquiring and holding physical inventory, futures contracts or derivative products. Net open positions are monitored by our Risk Management department for compliance with policy limits. These policies and practices, however, cannot eliminate all risks. Derivatives contracts and contracts for the future delivery of crude oil expose us to the risk of non-delivery under product purchase contracts or the failure of gathering and transportation systems. Any event that disrupts our anticipated physical supply of products could create a net open position that would expose us to risk of loss resulting from price changes.\nWe are also exposed to certain price risks that cannot be readily hedged, such as price risks for \u201cbasis differentials.\u201d Basis differentials can be created to the extent that our purchase or sales contracts call for delivery of a petroleum product of a grade, at a location, or at a time that differs from the specific delivery terms of offsetting purchase and sales agreements or derivative instruments. If this occurs, we may not be able to use the physical or derivative commodity markets to fully hedge our price risk. Our exposure to price risks could impact our operational and financial results.\nWe also have a risk that employees involved in our marketing operations may not comply at all times with our Risk Governance Policies. Even with management oversight, we cannot ensure with certainty that all violations of the Risk Governance Policies, particularly if deception or other intentional misconduct is involved, will be detected prior to our businesses being materially affected.\nConventional gas operations face continued competitive pressure from shale gas production.\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration reports that higher estimates of domestic shale gas resources support increasing estimates of domestic natural gas production at prices below its previous estimates.\nThe abundant supply of shale gas, driven by horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, places pressure on all conventional gas production, including sour gas production. In addition, facilities designed to remove hydrogen sulfide from a raw gas stream face increased competitive pressure because sour gas is more expensive to process than gas which does not contain sulfur.\nOur construction of new assets is subject to regulatory, environmental, legal and economic risks which could adversely affect our business.\nOne of the ways we intend to continue to grow our business is through the construction of new assets. The construction of additions or modifications to our existing systems and of new assets involves numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties beyond our control. In addition, the construction of additions to our existing gathering and transportation assets may require us to obtain new rights-of-way prior to constructing new pipelines. We may be unable to obtain such rights-of-way to connect new product supplies to our existing gathering lines or capitalize on other attractive expansion opportunities. Additionally, it may become more expensive for us to obtain new rights-of-way or to renew existing rights-of-way. Our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected if we are unable to complete the construction of new assets or additions to existing assets, the cost of such projects significantly exceed our estimates, such projects are delayed beyond our expectations, the cost of renewing existing rights-of-way increases, or if we lose our existing rights-of-way through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise.\nWe may face opposition to the construction and operation of our pipelines and facilities from various groups.\nWe may face opposition to the construction and operation of our pipelines and facilities from environmental groups, landowners, tribal groups, local groups and other advocates. Such opposition could take many forms, including organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage our operations, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets, or lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt or delay the construction and operation of our assets and business. For example, repairing our pipelines often involves securing consent from individual landowners to access their property; one or more landowners may resist our efforts to make needed repairs, which could lead to an interruption in the operation of the affected pipeline or facility for a period of time that is significantly longer than would have otherwise been the case. In addition, acts of sabotage could cause significant damage or injury to people, property or the environment or lead to extended interruptions of our operations. Any such event that interrupts the revenues generated by our operations, or which causes us to make significant expenditures not covered by insurance, could reduce our cash available for paying dividends to our Class A common stockholders and, accordingly, adversely affect our financial condition and the market price of our securities.\nChanges in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations.\nA portion of our revenue is generated from our operations in Canada, which use the Canadian dollar as the functional currency. Therefore, changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Canadian dollar could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the creditworthiness and performance of our customers, suppliers and transactional counterparties, including our hedge counterparties, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by one or more of these parties could adversely affect our financial and operational results.\nThere can be no assurance we have adequately assessed the creditworthiness of each of our existing or future customers, suppliers or transactional counterparties, including our hedge counterparties, or that there will not be a rapid or unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness, which may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. There is no certainty that our counterparties will perform or adhere to existing or future contractual arrangements.\nOur business involves many hazards and operational risks, some of which may not be covered by insurance.\nLeaks and other releases of hydrocarbons are possible in operations involving pipelines, tanks and processing units. Other possible operating risks include:\n\u2022\nthe breakdown or failure of equipment, information systems or processes;\n\u2022\nthe performance of equipment at levels below those originally intended (whether due to misuse, unexpected degradation or design, construction or manufacturing defects);\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain adequate inventories of spare parts;\n\u2022\noperator error;\n\u2022\nlabor disputes;\n\u2022\ndisputes with connected facilities and carriers;\n\u2022\npublic opposition activities; and\n\u2022\ncatastrophic events such as natural disasters, earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, explosions, fractures, acts of terrorism and other similar events, many of which are beyond our control.\nThese risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to, and destruction of, property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage, and may result in curtailment or suspension of our related operations. We are not fully insured against all risks incident to our business. In addition, as a result of market conditions, premiums for our insurance could increase significantly. In some instances, insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If a significant accident or event occurs that is not fully insured, it could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Even if a significant accident or event is covered by insurance, we may still have responsibility for applicable deductibles, and in addition, the proceeds of any such insurance may not be paid in a timely manner. With a few exceptions, our customers have not agreed to indemnify us for losses arising from a release of petroleum products, and we may instead be required to indemnify our customers in the event of a release or other incident.\nWe may not be able to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, which may limit our ability to grow. In addition, any acquisition that we pursue will involve risks that may adversely affect our business.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have expanded our operations through acquisitions and may continue to do so. We cannot accurately predict the timing, size and success of our acquisition efforts. We may be unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates, negotiate acceptable purchase terms or obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or because we are outbid by competitors. If we are unable to successfully acquire new businesses or assets, our future growth may be limited.\nAny acquisition that we may pursue will involve potential risks, including:\n\u2022\nperformance from the acquired businesses or assets that is below the forecasts we used in evaluating the acquisition;\n\u2022\na significant increase in our indebtedness and working capital requirements;\n\u2022\nthe inability to timely and effectively integrate the operations of recently acquired businesses or assets;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of substantial unforeseen environmental and other liabilities arising out of the acquired businesses or assets, including liabilities arising from the operation of the acquired businesses or assets prior to our acquisition;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with operating in lines of business that are distinct and separate from our historical operations;\n\u2022\nloss of customers or key employees of the acquired businesses; and\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect our ability to achieve anticipated levels of cash flows from our acquisitions, realize other anticipated benefits or meet our debt service requirements.\nWe are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the U.S.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on continued performance in our non-U.S. operations. We currently have operations in Canada, which are expected to expand with our recent acquisition of Meritage Midstream and further organic growth. In addition to the other risks described in this report on Form 10-K, there are numerous risks and uncertainties that specifically affect our non-U.S. operations. These risks and uncertainties include political and economic instability, changes in local governmental laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs, investments, taxation, exchange controls, employment regulations and repatriation of earnings, and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights. International transactions may also involve increased financial and legal risks due to differing legal systems and customs, including risks of non-compliance with U.S. and local laws affecting our activities abroad, including compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. While these factors and the impact of these factors are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our financial and operational results.\nWe may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity programs and related repairs.\nPursuant to the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, as reauthorized and amended by the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006, the DOT, through the PHMSA, has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop and implement integrity management programs for pipelines located where a leak or rupture could do the most harm in \u201chigh consequence areas,\u201d including high population areas, areas that are sources of drinking water, ecological resource areas that are unusually sensitive to environmental damage from a pipeline release and commercially navigable waterways, unless the operator effectively demonstrates, by risk assessment, that the pipeline could not affect the area. The integrity management regulations require operators, including us, to:\n\u2022\nperform on-going assessments of pipeline integrity on a recurring frequency schedule;\n\u2022\nidentify and characterize applicable potential threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area;\n\u2022\nimprove data collection, integration and analysis;\n\u2022\nrepair and remediate the pipeline as necessary; and\n\u2022\nimplement preventive and mitigating actions.\nIn addition, states have adopted regulations similar to existing DOT regulations for intrastate gathering and transmission lines. We currently estimate that we will incur an aggregate cost of approximately $11.8 million during 2019 to implement necessary pipeline integrity management program testing along certain segments of our pipelines required by existing DOT and state regulations. This estimate does not include the costs, if any, of any repair, remediation, preventive or mitigating actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program, which costs could be substantial. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these regulations, as the cost will vary significantly depending on the number and extent of any repairs found to be necessary as a result of the pipeline integrity testing. We will continue our pipeline integrity testing programs on an on-going basis to assess and maintain the integrity of our pipelines. The results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operations of our pipelines and, consequently, result in a reduction in our revenue and cash flows from shutting down our pipelines during the pendency of such repairs or upgrades.\nA prolonged decline in index prices at Cushing relative to other index prices could reduce the demand for our transportation to, and storage in, Cushing.\nShifts in the overall supply of, and demand for, crude oil in regional, national and global markets, over which we have no control, can have an adverse impact on crude oil index prices in the markets we serve relative to other index prices. A prolonged decline in the WTI Index price, relative to other index prices, may cause reduced demand for our transportation to, and storage in, Cushing, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdverse developments in our existing areas of operation could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur operations are focused on gathering, transporting, storing, processing, treating and marketing petroleum products and are principally located in the Midwest, Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain supply regions of the U.S. and in Alberta, Canada. As a result, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition depend upon the demand for our services in these regions. Due to our current lack of broad diversification in industry type and geographic location, adverse developments in our current segment of the midstream industry, or our existing areas of operation, could have a significantly greater impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition than if our operations were more diversified.\nWe are subject to regulation by multiple governmental agencies, and the nature and degree of regulation from such agencies could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business activities are subject to regulation by multiple federal, state and local governmental agencies. Our historical operating costs reflect the recurring costs resulting from compliance with these regulations and we do not anticipate material expenditures in excess of these amounts in the absence of future acquisitions, or changes in regulation, or discovery of existing but unknown compliance issues. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the midstream industry are regularly considered by Congress, as well as by state legislatures and federal and state regulatory commissions, agencies and courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective or the magnitude of the impact changes in laws and regulations may have on our business. However, additions to the regulatory burden on our industry generally increase our cost of doing business and affect our profitability.\nOur trucking fleet operations are subject to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations which are enacted, reviewed and amended by the FMCSA. Our fleet currently has a \"satisfactory\" safety rating; however, if our safety rating were downgraded to \"unsatisfactory,\" our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAll federally regulated carriers safety ratings are measured through a program implemented by the FMCSA known as the Compliance Safety Accountability (\"CSA\") program. The CSA program measures a carrier's safety performance based on violations observed during roadside inspections as opposed to compliance audits performed by the FMCSA. The quantity and severity of any violations are compared to a peer group of companies of comparable size and annual mileage. If a company rises above a threshold established by the FMCSA, it is subject to action from the FMCSA. There is a progressive intervention\nstrategy that begins with a company providing the FMCSA with an acceptable plan of corrective action that the company will implement. If the issues are not corrected, the intervention escalates to on-site compliance audits and ultimately an \"unsatisfactory\" rating and the revocation of our operating authority by the FMCSA could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may incur significant costs and liabilities in the future resulting from a failure to comply with new or existing environmental laws or regulations or an accidental release of hazardous substances, petroleum products or wastes into the environment.\nOur operations are subject to federal and foreign, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws include, for example:\n\u2022\nfederal and comparable state and foreign laws that impose obligations related to air emissions;\n\u2022\nfederal and comparable state and foreign laws that impose requirements for the handling, storage, treatment or disposal of solid and hazardous waste from our facilities;\n\u2022\nfederal and comparable state and foreign laws that regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or at locations to which our hazardous substances have been transported for disposal; and\n\u2022\nfederal and comparable state and foreign laws that regulate discharges from our facilities, require spill protection planning and preparation and set requirements for other actions for protection of waters.\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations, or newly adopted laws or regulations, may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements on such operations. Claims pursued under certain environmental laws impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances or petroleum products have been disposed or otherwise released. Provisions also exist that may require remediation or other compensation to pay for damages to natural resources. Moreover, it is not uncommon for individuals to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, petroleum products or waste products in the environment.\nThere is an inherent risk of incurring environmental costs and liabilities in connection with our operations due to our handling of crude oil and natural gas, air emissions and water discharges related to our operations and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. For example, an accidental release from one of our facilities could subject us to substantial liabilities for environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by individuals for personal injury, natural resource and property damages and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations. Moreover, the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase our operational or compliance costs and, the cost of any remediation that may become necessary. We may not be able to recover all or any of these costs from insurance and fines or penalties paid for compliance violations, whether alleged or proven, will not be covered by insurance.\nOur storage operations are influenced by the overall forward market for crude oil and other products we store, and certain market conditions may adversely affect our financial and operating results.\nOur storage operations are influenced by the overall forward market for crude oil and other products we store. A contango market (meaning that the price of crude oil or other products for future delivery is higher than the current price) is associated with greater demand for storage capacity, because a party can simultaneously purchase crude oil or other products at current prices for storage and sell at higher prices for future delivery. A backwardated market (meaning that the price of crude oil or other products for future delivery is lower than the current price) is associated with lower demand for storage capacity because a party can capture a premium for prompt delivery of crude oil or other products rather than storing it for future sale. A prolonged backwardated market, or other adverse market conditions, could have an adverse impact on our ability to negotiate favorable prices under new or renewing storage contracts, which could have an adverse impact on our storage revenues. As a result, the overall forward market for crude oil or other products may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders.\nAn increase in interest rates could impact demand for our storage capacity.\nThere is a financing cost for a storage capacity user to own crude oil while it is stored. That financing cost is impacted by the cost of capital or interest rate incurred by the storage user, in addition to the commodity cost of the crude oil in inventory. Absent other factors, a higher financing cost adversely impacts the economics of storing crude oil for future sale. As\na result, a significant increase in interest rates could adversely affect the demand for our storage capacity independent of other market factors.\nSevere weather conditions and natural or man-made disasters could severely disrupt normal operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe operate in various locations across the U.S. and Canada, which may be adversely affected by severe weather conditions and natural or man-made disasters. During periods of heavy snow, ice, rain or extreme weather conditions such as high winds, tornadoes and hurricanes or after other natural disasters such as earthquakes or wildfires, we may be unable to move our trucks between locations and our facilities may be damaged, thereby reducing our ability to provide services and generate revenues. These same conditions may cause serious damage or destruction to the property and operations of our customers. Such disruptions could potentially have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nClimate change legislation and related regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our services.\nBeginning in December 2009, the EPA published several findings and rulemakings under the Clean Air Act requiring the permitting and reporting of certain greenhouse gases (\"GHG\") including CO2 and methane. Our facilities are subject to these requirements. Operational and/or regulatory changes could require additional facilities to comply with GHG emissions reporting and permitting requirements.\nOn October 23, 2015, the EPA published as a final rule the Clean Power Plan, which sets interim and final CO2 emission performance rates for power generating units that are fueled by coal, oil or natural gas. The final rule is the focus of legislative discussion in the U.S. Congress and litigation in federal court. On February 10, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the final rule, effectively suspending the duty to comply with the rule until certain legal challenges are resolved. In October 2017, the EPA proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan. In August 2018, the EPA proposed to replace the Clean Power Plan and Affordable Clean Energy rule. The ultimate determination of the Clean Power Plan and Affordable Clean Energy rule remains uncertain. While we do not operate power plants that would be subject to the Clean Power Plan or the Affordable Clean Energy rule, it remains unclear what effect a final rule, if it comes into force, might have on the anticipated demand for natural gas, including natural gas that we gather, process, store and transport.\nAt the state level, more than one-third of the states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional GHG \"cap and trade\" programs. Although many of the state-level initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, it is possible that sources such as our gas-fueled compressors and processing plants could become subject to related state regulations. Various states are also proposing or have implemented more strict regulations for GHGs that go beyond the requirements of the EPA. Some of the states have implemented regulations that require additional monitoring and reporting of methane emissions. Depending on the state programs pending implementation, we could be required to conduct additional monitoring, do additional emissions reporting and/or purchase and surrender emission allowances\nCanadian federal regulations creating GHG performance standards for the transportation sector and for coal-fired electricity generation were established by the previous federal government in recent years and the oil and gas sector was targeted for similar regulations in the future. A new federal government was elected on October 19, 2015. It indicated that a key priority is to provide national leadership to reduce emission, combat climate change and price carbon, in partnership with provinces and territories. On December 12, 2015, the federal government reached an international agreement with 195 countries at the Paris Climate Conference and stated that it will support and implement policies that contribute to a low-carbon economy. In October 2016 the Federal Government ratified the Paris Agreement and implemented the pan-Canadian carbon-pricing framework, which set the price of emissions of CO2 at $50 per tonne by 2022. The implementation of the pan-Canadian framework will be left to the individual provincial governments.\nThe province of Alberta is currently reviewing how to integrate the pan-Canadian framework into the existing legislation for large GHG emitters. Based upon the federal carbon pricing direction, the costs of future emissions will increase from the current $20/t CO2e to $50/t CO2e in 2022. The details of which processes will be taxed is still being evaluated by the Alberta Provincial government.\nDepending on the particular law, regulation or program, we could be required to incur capital expenditures for installing new monitoring equipment, acquire and surrender allowances for the GHG emissions, pay taxes related to the GHG emissions and administer and manage a GHG emissions program. We are not able at this time to estimate such increased costs; however, as is the case with similarly situated entities in the industry, they could be significant to us. While we may be able to\ninclude some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by our pipelines, recovery of costs in all cases is uncertain and may depend on events beyond our control, including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the FERC or other regulatory bodies, and the provisions of any final legislation or other regulations. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects\nWe face intense competition in our gathering, transportation, processing, storage and marketing activities. Competition from other providers of those services that are able to supply our customers with those services at a lower price or on otherwise better terms could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe are subject to competition from other gathering, transportation, processing, storage and marketing operations that may be able to supply our customers with the same or comparable services at a lower price or otherwise on better terms. We compete with national, regional and local gathering, transportation and storage companies of widely varying sizes, financial resources and experience, including the major integrated oil companies. Our ability to compete could be harmed by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nprice competition;\n\u2022\nthe perception that another company can provide better service; and\n\u2022\nthe availability of alternative supply points, or supply points located closer to the operations of our customers.\nSome of our competitors have greater financial, managerial and other resources than we do, and control substantially more storage or transportation capacity than we do. Our competitors may expand their assets or operations, creating additional competition for the services we provide to our customers. In addition, our customers may develop their own gathering, transportation and storage systems or marketing operations in lieu of using ours. Our ability to renew or replace existing contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenues and cash flow could be adversely affected by the activities of our competitors and our customers.\nWe may not be able to renew or replace expiring storage and transportation contracts.\nWe have significant exposure to market risk at the time our existing storage and transportation contracts expire and are subject to renegotiation and renewal. The extension or replacement of existing contracts depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe level of existing and new competition to provide storage and transportation services to our markets;\n\u2022\nthe macroeconomic factors affecting crude oil storage and transportation economics for our current and potential customers;\n\u2022\nthe balance of supply and demand, on a short-term, seasonal and long-term basis, in our markets;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which the customers in our markets are willing to contract on a long-term basis; and\n\u2022\nthe effects of federal, state or local regulations on the contracting practices of our customers.\nAny failure to extend or replace a significant portion of our existing contracts, or extend or replace them at comparable rates, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nA change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal, state or local regulatory agencies, or a change in policy by those agencies, could result in increased regulation of our assets, which could affect existing costs and rates.\nInterstate transportation and gathering pipelines that do not provide interstate services are not subject to regulation by FERC. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated interstate pipeline transportation, on the one hand, and intrastate pipeline transportation, on the other hand, is a fact-based determination. The classification and regulation of our crude oil pipelines are subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, federal courts, Congress or regulatory commissions, courts or legislatures in the states in which we operate.\nOur Kansas and Oklahoma gathering pipeline system carries crude oil owned by us and by third parties. We own all of the crude oil shipped on our pipeline system across state lines. We believe that the pipeline segments on which we provide service to third parties and the services we provide to third parties on the gathering pipeline system meet the traditional tests that FERC has used to determine that the pipeline services provided are not interstate commerce. We believe that the pipeline segments on which we transport only crude oil owned by us should not be subject to regulation by FERC under the ICA, or that these pipeline segments would qualify for waiver from FERC\u2019s regulatory requirements, if applicable. However, we cannot provide assurance that FERC will not in the future, either at the request of other entities or on its own initiative, determine that\nsome or all of our Kansas and Oklahoma gathering pipeline system and the services we provide on that system are within its jurisdiction, or that such a determination would not adversely affect our results of operations. If some or all of the gathering system were subject to FERC jurisdiction, and not otherwise exempt from any applicable regulatory requirements, for that portion of the gathering pipeline system we would be required to file a tariff with FERC, and if our tariff rates were subject to protest, provide a cost justification for the transportation rate subject to protest and provide service to all potential shippers without undue discrimination. In addition, if the services we provide on any segment(s) of our gathering system become regulated by FERC under the ICA, our services could be subject to a protest and/or complaint before FERC. If FERC were to determine, in response to a complaint, that our rates are unjust and unreasonable, we could be required to pay reparations and refunds dating to two years before the filing of the complaint. Furthermore, if in the future our services become subject to state regulation, they could be subject to a protest and/or complaint before a state commission with jurisdiction.\nIncreasing levels of congestion in the Houston Ship Channel could result in a diversion of business to less busy ports.\nOur Gulf Coast facilities are strategically situated on prime real estate located in the Houston Ship Channel, which is in close proximity to both supply sources and demand sources. In recent years, the success of the Port of Houston has led to an increase in vessel traffic driven in part by the growing overseas demand for U.S. crude, gasoline, liquefied natural gas and petrochemicals and in part by the Port of Houston\u2019s recent decision to accept large container vessels, which can restrict the flow of other cargo. Increasing congestion in the Port of Houston could cause our customers or potential customers to divert their business to smaller ports in the Gulf of Mexico, which could result in lower utilization of our facilities.\nIncreased regulation of hydraulic fracturing or produced water disposal could result in reductions or delays in crude oil and natural gas production in our areas of operation, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nThe hydraulic fracturing process has come under considerable scrutiny from sections of the public as well as environmental and other groups asserting that chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process could adversely affect drinking water supplies and may have other detrimental impacts on public health, safety, welfare and the environment. In addition, the water disposal process has come under scrutiny from sections of the public as well as environmental and other groups asserting that the operation of certain water disposal wells has caused increased seismic activity. The adoption of new laws or regulations imposing additional permitting, disclosures, restrictions or costs related to hydraulic fracturing or produced water disposal or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing in proximity to areas considered to be environmentally sensitive could make drilling certain wells impossible or less economically attractive. As a result, the volume of crude oil and natural gas we gather, transport and store for our customers could be substantially reduced which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nCompetition for water resources or limitations on water usage for hydraulic fracturing could disrupt crude oil and natural gas production from shale formations.\nHydraulic fracturing is the process of creating or expanding cracks by pumping water, sand and chemicals under high pressure into an underground formation in order to increase the productivity of crude oil and natural gas wells. Water used in the process is generally fresh water, recycled produced water or salt water.\nThere is competition for fresh water from municipalities, farmers, ranchers and industrial users. In addition, the available supply of fresh water can also be reduced directly by drought. Prolonged drought conditions increase the intensity of competition for fresh water.\nLimitations on oil and gas producers\u2019 access to fresh water may restrict their ability to use hydraulic fracturing and could reduce new production. Such disruptions could potentially have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLoss of key employees could significantly reduce our ability to execute strategies.\nMuch of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel including the executive team and skilled employees in technical, operational and staff positions. We depend on current and new key officers and employees to meet the challenges and complexities of our businesses. If any such officers or employees resign, or become unable to continue in their present roles and are not adequately replaced, or if we are unable to fill vacant positions, our business operations could be materially adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will continue to attract and retain key personnel.\nA failure in our operational systems or cyber security attacks on any of our facilities, or those of third parties, may affect adversely our financial results.\nOur business is dependent upon our operational systems to process a large amount of data and complex transactions. If any of our financial, operational, or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, our financial results could be adversely affected. Our financial results could also be adversely affected if an employee causes our operational systems to fail, either as a result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating our operational systems. In addition, dependence upon automated systems may further increase the risk that operational system flaws, employee tampering or manipulation of those systems could result in losses that are difficult to detect.\nWe have become more reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our business. We use numerous technologies to help run our operations, and this may subject our business to increased risks. Any cyber security attack that affects our facilities, our customers or any financial data could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, a cyber attack on our customer and employee data may result in a financial loss, including potential fines for failure to safeguard data, and may negatively impact our reputation. Third-party systems on which we rely could also suffer system failure. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business, result in potential liability or reputational damage or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nThe threat or attack of terrorists aimed at our facilities could adversely affect our business.\nThe U.S. government has issued warnings that energy assets, specifically the nation\u2019s pipeline infrastructure, may be future targets of terrorist organizations. Any future terrorist attack that may target our facilities, those of our customers or those of certain other pipelines could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, any governmental body mandated actions to prepare for, or protect against, potential terrorist attacks could require us to spend money or modify our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nHolders of our Class A common stock may not receive dividends in the amount identified in guidance or any dividends.\nWe may not have sufficient cash each quarter to pay dividends or maintain current or expected levels of dividends. The actual amount of cash we pay out in dividends may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and will depend on various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe amount of cash that our subsidiaries distribute to us;\n\u2022\nthe amount of cash we generate from our operations, our working capital needs, our level of capital expenditures and our ability to borrow;\n\u2022\nthe restrictions contained in our indentures, the certificate of designations for our Preferred Stock and our credit agreements and our debt service requirements; and\n\u2022\nthe cost of acquisitions, if any.\nA failure either to pay dividends or to pay dividends at expected levels could result in a loss of investor confidence, reputational damage and a decrease in the market price of our Class A common stock.\nOur Class A Common Stock may experience significant price and volume fluctuations.\nThe market price of our Class A Common Stock may fluctuate significantly in response to various factors and events beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe risk factors described in this report on Form 10-K;\n\u2022\nour operating and financial results differing from that expected by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nthe financial and stock price performance of our competitors or companies in our industry generally;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations which adversely affect our industry or us;\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in our customers\u2019 industries, including changes in commodity prices; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions, prevailing interest rates and conditions in the securities markets.", "PERMNO": 12384, "SIC": 5171, "TIC": "SEMG"}
