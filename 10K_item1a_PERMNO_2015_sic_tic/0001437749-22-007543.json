You should consider carefully the following risks in addition to the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the SEC before deciding to buy, sell or hold our Common Stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our Common Stock could be materially adversely affected, the value of our Common Stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our Company, but those that we consider to be material. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also significantly impair our business operations. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Please also read carefully the section below entitled \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur business may be adversely affected by the continuing coronavirus outbreak.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders and other public health measures were implemented across much of the United States, including the San Francisco Bay area counties where our headquarters is located. Due to \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders and other public health guidance measures, we implemented a temporary work-from-home policy for all staff members that has since been lifted. Overall, the impact of COVID-19 to date has been minimal on the sales of Avenova Spray as an increase in online sales has made up for the decrease in revenue from other channels. In addition, we recently acquired DERMAdoctor and have not yet fully integrated its business, operations or products with ours and the impact of COVID-19 on this integration and/or the future sales of our DERMAdoctor products is uncertain given the shift in sales channels away from brick-and-mortar retail stores. Although we and DERMAdoctor have not experienced a material disruption in our supply chain to date due to COVID-19, as the pandemic continues, the availability of raw materials, goods and/or services from our suppliers could be disrupted and/or not provided in a timely manner or in the quantities that we require in order to operate our business in the ordinary course, which could materially and adversely affect our product sales, customer service levels and our overall business. In addition, any increases in the costs of goods and services for our business that could result from such disruptions in our supply chain or as a result of inflation in the overall costs of goods and services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies in our operations.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic continues to evolve. The extent to which the outbreak and the different variants may continue to affect our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, such as the duration of the outbreak, evolution of COVID-19 into novel strands of the disease, travel restrictions and actions to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, such as social distancing, quarantines or lock-downs in the United States and elsewhere, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and elsewhere to contain and treat the disease through vaccination. Future developments in these and other areas present material uncertainty and risk with respect to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Since the success of our business, including DERMAdoctor\u2019s business, relies upon the strength of the United States and other retail economies, any sustained economic downturn in the United States or the other countries in which we conduct business could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur future success is largely dependent on the successful commercialization of our products, particularly Avenova Spray, and of the newly acquired DERMAdoctor products.\nIf we are unable to establish and maintain adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into or maintain agreements with third parties to do so, we may be unable to successfully commercialize our products, including the products that we recently acquired as a result of the DERMAdoctor Acquisition. While we believe we are creating an efficient commercial organization, we may not be able to correctly judge the size and experience of the sales and marketing force and the scale of distribution necessary to be successful. Establishing and maintaining sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities are expensive and time-consuming. Such expenses may be disproportionate compared to the revenues we may be able to generate on sales of Avenova branded, and/or our DERMAdoctor branded products, which could cause our commercialization efforts to be unprofitable or less profitable than expected.\nAcceptance and use of Avenova and/or DERMAdoctor branded products by physicians, retail partners and other customers may depend on a number of factors including: (i) perceptions by members of the healthcare community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our products\u037e (ii) published studies demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of our products relative to competing products; (iii) availability of reimbursement for our products from government or commercial payers as relates to Avenova Spray\u037e and (iv) effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any. The failure of any of our products to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing to fund our operations.\nWe face substantial competition in the eyecare and the skincare markets in which we operate.\nAvenova Spray faces intense competition in the eyecare market, which is focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product effectiveness and quality, patient convenience and technological innovation. There is substantial competition in the eyecare market from companies of all sizes in the United States and abroad, including, among others, large companies such as Allergan plc and Shire plc, and against products such as Restasis, Xiidra, eye wipes, baby shampoo and soap. There are also over-the-counter products that contain hypochlorous acid that compete with Avenova Spray.\nFor our newly acquired DERMAdoctor products that operate in the skincare and beauty industries, we also face vigorous competition from companies globally, including large multinational consumer products companies that have many skincare brands under ownership and standalone skincare brands, including those that may target the latest trends or specific distribution channels. The skincare and beauty industries are highly competitive and subject to rapid changes due to consumer preferences and industry trends. Competition in the skincare industry is generally based on the introduction of new products, pricing of products, quality of products and packaging, brand awareness, perceived value and quality, innovation, in-store presence and visibility, promotional activities, advertising, editorials, e-commerce and mobile-commerce initiatives and other activities. We must compete with a high volume of new product introductions and existing products by diverse companies across several different distribution channels. Our skincare and other beauty products face, and will continue to face, competition for consumer recognition and market share with products that have achieved significant national and international brand name recognition and consumer loyalty, such as those offered by global prestige beauty companies like Avon Products, Inc., Elizabeth Arden, Inc., The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Inc., L\u2019Or\u00e9al Group, Shiseido, Coty, Mary Kay, Inc. and The Proctor & Gamble Company, each of which have launched skincare brands. In addition, we compete with brands including Dr. Dennis Gross, Kate Somerville, Murad, Perricone M.D., Dr. Brandt, Clarins, Clinique, Dermalogica, Exuviance, La Roche-Posay and Vichy. We also compete with numerous other companies that market skincare products. Competition may increase further as existing competitors enhance their offerings or additional companies enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with our products.\nThese companies that we compete against in the eyecare, skincare and beauty industries may have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources, longer operating histories, greater brand recognition and larger customer bases than we do and may be able to respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions than we can. If our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, our products may be rendered obsolete or non-competitive. In addition, if our competitors develop more effective or affordable products, or achieve earlier intellectual property protection or product commercialization than we do, our operating results will materially suffer. Competition may increase further as existing competitors enhance their offerings or additional companies enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with our products. We may not be able to sustain growth as competitive pressures, including pricing pressure from competitors, increase. Our ability to compete depends on the continued strength of our brand and products, the success of our marketing, innovation and execution strategies, the continued diversity of our product offerings, the successful management of new product introductions and innovations, strong operational execution, including in order fulfillment, and our success in entering new markets and expanding our business in existing geographies. If we are unable to continue to compete effectively, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are dependent on third parties to supply raw materials used in our products and to manufacture our products. Any interruption or failure by these suppliers or other disruptions to our supply chain may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to make, move, and sell our products is critical to our success. Historically, we have predominately relied on a single product, Avenova Spray, for our primary revenue stream, which is comprised of our proprietary, stable and pure form of hypochlorous acid. In acquiring DERMAdoctor, we are greatly expanding our product offerings and operations, as DERMAdoctor has an extensive global platform, currently selling over 30 products in various countries, with over 40 commercial relationships that supply its products from around the globe. While product sales in the United States have historically driven DERMAdoctor\u2019s revenue, it has strategically sought international opportunities for the sale and distribution of its products. DERMAdoctor\u2019s products are currently offered internationally in China, the Middle East, Europe, Canada, and Central and South America. With this larger operational business and range of product offerings around the globe, comes additional opportunity for us as well as corresponding risk in certain areas. A key risk area, which is emphasized further by the current pandemic environment and conflict between Russia and Ukraine, is that of supply chain risk. Our subsidiary, DERMAdoctor, also uses third party contract manufacturers and suppliers, some internationally, to obtain substantially all raw materials, components, and packaging products and to manufacture finished products.\nDamage or disruption to our supply chain, including third-party manufacturing, assembly or transportation and distribution capabilities, due to weather, including any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), strikes, government action, war (such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine) or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and business partners, could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is sourced from a single supplier or location, could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nFurther, we rely on third parties to supply raw materials, components, and packaging products, to manufacture finished products, and distribute our products. Any interruption or failure by our suppliers, distributors and other partners to meet their obligations on schedule or in accordance with our expectations, misappropriation of our proprietary information, including trade secrets and know-how, or any termination by these third parties of their arrangements with us, which, in each case, could be the result of one or many factors outside of our control, could delay or prevent the manufacture or commercialization of our products, disrupt our operations or cause reputational harm to our company, particularly with wholesale customers, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn particular, a large portion of DERMAdoctor\u2019s revenue is from wholesale customers, which in accordance with standard industry practice, do not typically operate under written contracts or advance commitments for products. Such wholesale customers generally place large orders shortly before such products are needed. Due to cost and product shelf life, the DERMAdoctor business does not keep a large inventory on hand, however, it must have the ability to quickly provide products to wholesale customers upon demand. Therefore, our DERMAdoctor business relies on its third-party suppliers to be able to quickly respond to DERMAdoctor product needs, and if such supply chain is interrupted, could cause a material adverse effect on our business, reputation with wholesale customers and financial condition.\nDERMAdoctor\u2019s operating results are dependent on sales to a few significant retail partners and the loss of, or substantial decline in, sales to one of these retail partners could have a material adverse effect on our expected future revenues and profitability.\nRetail partners that purchase our DERMAdoctor products account for a substantial percentage of net sales revenue, and the loss of all or a portion of the sales to any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations generated by the DERMAdoctor business. In particular, prior to the DERMAdoctor Acquisition, sales to retail partners accounted for approximately 50.8% of DERMAdoctor\u2019s gross sales revenue in fiscal 2020. We expect that a small group of retail partners will continue to account for a significant portion of DERMAdoctor\u2019s gross sales revenue for the foreseeable future. Although DERMAdoctor developed long-standing relationships with its major retail partners, it generally does not, consistent with industry norms, have written agreements or advance commitments that require these retail partners to buy from DERMAdoctor or to purchase a minimum amount of DERMAdoctor products. A substantial decrease in sales to any of DERMAdoctor\u2019s major retail partners could have a material adverse effect on the DERMAdoctor business and our financial condition and operating results.\nPotential disruptions to our distribution facility could cause interruptions or delays in our business and adversely affect our net sales and results of operations.\nOur ability to meet the needs of our consumers and retail customers depends on the proper operation of our Riverside, Missouri distribution facility, where a significant portion of our inventory that is not in transit is housed. Although we currently insure our inventory, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover the full extent of any loss or damage to our inventory or distribution facility, and any loss, damage or disruption of this facility, or loss or damage of the inventory and contents stored there, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. A natural disaster or other catastrophic event, such as a fire, flood, severe storm, break-in, terrorist attack or other comparable event could cause loss of inventory and interruptions or delays in our business and could render us unable to accept or fulfill customer orders in a timely manner, or at all. Our warehouse is located in an area that has historically been subject to severe storms and tornados. This increases our susceptibility to the risk that severe weather conditions could harm the operations of our distribution facility. In the event that a storm, tornado, fire, natural disaster or other catastrophic event were to destroy a significant part of the facility or interrupt our operations for an extended period of time, our net sales could be reduced, and our results of operations could be harmed.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our businesses.\nWe rely upon information technology systems to operate our businesses. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information (including, but not limited to, personal information and intellectual property), and we deploy and operate an array of technical and procedural controls to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We also have outsourced aspects of our operations to third parties, including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and, as a result, we are managing independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems, and those of our third-party vendors with whom we contract, make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors, or from attacks by malicious third parties. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise, including organized criminal groups, \u201chacktivists,\u201d nation states and others. While we have invested in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches. Any such interruption or breach of our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us.\nAdverse U.S. or international economic conditions could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face risks associated with U.S. and international economic conditions and are subject to events beyond our control including war, public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), trade disputes, economic sanctions, and their collateral impacts. In particular, consumer spending on skincare and beauty products, as well as eyecare products, is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income. Adverse U.S. or international economic conditions or periods of inflation or high energy prices may contribute to higher unemployment levels, decreased consumer spending, reduced credit availability and declining consumer confidence and demand, each of which poses a risk to our business. A decrease in consumer spending or in retailer and consumer confidence and demand for our products could have a significant negative impact on our net sales and profitability, including our operating margins and return on invested capital. These economic conditions could cause some of our retail customers or suppliers to experience cash flow or credit problems and impair their financial condition, which could disrupt our business and adversely affect product orders, payment patterns and default rates and increase our bad debt expense. In addition, deterioration in global financial markets could make future financing difficult or more expensive, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to finance the acquisition of inventory for sale to our customers. In February 2022, armed conflict escalated between Russia and Ukraine. The sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other countries against Russia, following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, to date include restrictions on selling or importing goods, services, or technology in or from affected regions and travel bans and asset freezes impacting connected individuals and political, military, business and financial organizations in Russia. The U.S. and other countries could impose wider sanctions and take other actions should the conflict further escalate. It is not possible to predict the broader consequences of this conflict, which could include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, currency exchange rates and financial markets, all of which could impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the DERMAdoctor Acquisition and DERMAdoctor\u2019s Products\nUncertainty about the DERMAdoctor Acquisition may adversely affect the relationships that we and DERMAdoctor have with our respective customers, service providers and employees.\nParties with whom we or DERMAdoctor do business may experience uncertainty associated with the recent DERMAdoctor Acquisition, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us or DERMAdoctor. These business relationships may be subject to disruption as end customers, suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and others may attempt to (i) negotiate changes in existing business relationships, (ii) delay, defer or cease supplying or manufacturing for, or purchasing products from, us or DERMAdoctor or (iii) consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us or DERMAdoctor, including our competitors or those of DERMAdoctor. These disruptions, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on the combined business and upon our operating results and financial condition.\nUncertainties associated with the DERMAdoctor Acquisition may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees that could adversely affect our future business, operations and financial results.\nWith the DERMAdoctor Acquisition having been completed, the ongoing integration of the combined businesses could disrupt our business. We and DERMAdoctor are both dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our respective senior management and other key employees to develop new products and execute our respective business plans. Our success will depend in part upon our ability to retain both key management personnel and key employees of DERMAdoctor. Although we entered into employment agreements with Dr. Audrey Kunin and Dr. Jeffrey Kunin, who are also incentivized to team with us over the next two years to achieve potential Earn Out Payments pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, and all of the other employees of DERMAdoctor continued as employees after the Acquisition Closing, there is no guarantee that current and prospective future employees we hire for the DERMAdoctor business will continue with us, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to effectively integrate DERMAdoctor into our business or for us to attract or retain key management and other key personnel. All of DERMAdoctor\u2019s existing and new products in development were conceived by its product design team led by Dr. Audrey Kunin, who is a board-certified dermatologist. Dr. Kunin is continuing post-transaction in her leadership role of new product development, and the loss of Dr. Kunin\u2019s service in this capacity could have a material and adverse effect on our ability to effectively develop and launch new products until such position could be filled by us.\nThe DERMAdoctor Acquisition involves risks associated with acquisitions and integrating acquired businesses and the intended benefits of the DERMAdoctor Acquisition may not be realized by us.\nThe DERMAdoctor Acquisition, which was completed on November 5, 2021, involves risks that are associated with acquisitions and integrating acquired businesses and their operations with existing operations, including:\n\u25cf\nour senior management\u2019s attention may be diverted from the management of daily operations to the integration of DERMAdoctor\u2019s products and business that we have acquired;\n\u25cf\nthe challenges, including delays or any other unanticipated changed circumstances, and costs involved in integrating and/or developing DERMAdoctor products and other assets that we have acquired;\n\u25cf\nfailure of the products and other assets that we acquired in the DERMAdoctor Acquisition to generate anticipated revenues, and/or otherwise perform in accordance with our expectations; and\n\u25cf\nfailure to achieve the anticipated efficiencies and cost savings or realize other expected benefits of the DERMAdoctor Acquisition within the expected time frame or at all.\nIf these risks or other unexpected costs and liabilities were to materialize, any desired benefits of the DERMAdoctor Acquisition may not be fully realized, if at all, and our future financial performance and results of operations could be negatively impacted. In addition, if the combined company does not perform as we or the market expects, then this could have an adverse effect on the price of our Common Stock.\nActual results may differ from any statements made by us concerning the anticipated impact of the DERMAdoctor Acquisition on the operating results of the combined company, and these differences could be material.\nAlthough we believe that we have a reasonable basis for such forward-looking statements, these statements are based on our projections of future events that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the combined company\u2019s actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements to differ in a material way. Additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from currently anticipated results include, but are not limited to, risks relating to our ability to successfully integrate DERMAdoctor; unanticipated increases in costs or expenses; our ability to realize expected cost synergies; our ability to reach profitability as a result of the DERMAdoctor Acquisition, and the other risks identified herein and the documents included herein that we urge you to read. Our actual financial condition and results of operations as a result of the DERMAdoctor Acquisition may not be consistent with, or evident from, the statements for the periods covered by this report. Consequently, actual results or developments anticipated by us may not be realized or, even if substantially realized, may not have the expected consequences to, or effects on, us. In particular, while the DERMAdoctor Acquisition is expected to be accretive to NovaBay\u2019s profitability in the first year after close, there can be no assurance with respect to the timing and scope of the accretive effect or whether it will be accretive at all. Any failure to meet expectations regarding the prospects for the combined company could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation, as well as the trading price and/or volume of our Common Stock.\nCharges to earnings resulting from the application of the purchase method of accounting following the Closing of the DERMAdoctor Acquisition may adversely affect the market value of our Common Stock.\nThe DERMAdoctor Acquisition will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting, which will result in charges to earnings that could have an adverse impact on the market value of our Common Stock. Under the purchase method of accounting, the total estimated Purchase Price will be allocated to DERMAdoctor\u2019s pro forma net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets based on their respective fair values as of the Acquisition Closing. Any excess of the Purchase Price over those fair values will be recorded as goodwill. As a result of the consolidation of DERMAdoctor with our Company, we will incur additional amortization expense based on the identifiable amortizable intangible assets acquired pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and their relative useful lives. Additionally, to the extent the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets or other long-lived assets may become impaired, we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment. These amortization and potential impairment charges could have a material impact on the combined company\u2019s results of operations.\nRisk Related to Government Regulation\nWe expect continuous revenue from sales of Avenova Spray, which is classified as a cleared medical device by the FDA, but we cannot guarantee that the FDA will continue to allow us to market and sell Avenova Spray as a cleared medical device, which marketing inability would halt our sales and marketing of Avenova Spray and cause us to lose revenue and materially and adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our business.\nOur ability to continue to commercialize Avenova Spray and generate revenue from Avenova Spray depends upon, among other things:\n\u25cf\nthe FDA allowing us to continue marketing Avenova Spray as an FDA cleared medical device;\n\u25cf\nacceptance in the medical community;\n\u25cf\nthe safety of Avenova Spray\u2019s predicate devices;\n\u25cf\nthe number of patients who use Avenova Spray;\n\u25cf\ncoverage or reimbursement by third-party payors of Avenova Spray;\n\u25cf\nour ability to successfully market Avenova Spray to both doctors and patients; and\n\u25cf\nthe amount and nature of competition from competing companies with similar products.\nRevenue from the Avenova brand will be subject to, among other things, regulatory and commercial and market uncertainties that may be outside of our control. The clearance that we have received from the FDA for our Avenova Spray, NeutroPhase, PhaseOne and other products is subject to strict limitations on the indicated uses for which the products may be marketed. The labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, and record keeping for all of our products, including those that are not subject to FDA clearance, are subject to extensive regulatory requirements.\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that government regulations applicable to our products will not change and thereby prevent the marketing of some or all of our products for a period of time or permanently. The FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could modify, prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the U.S. or in other countries. We cannot guarantee that Avenova Spray, our other cleared products, or products that may be approved or cleared for marketing in the future, will not be materially adversely impacted by a change in industry standards or regulations. If changes to industry standards, practices or regulations applicable to Avenova Spray or our other cleared products that we may market and sell in the future cause a delay in continued commercialization or if we cannot make a change to satisfy the industry standards, practices or regulations, we may not be able to meet market demand which may have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nAdditionally, the FDA may request that we submit another 510(k) premarket submission that compares to another predicate device. If we are unable to find an adequate predicate device that is substantially equivalent to Avenova Spray for the treatment claims that we use to sell and market Avenova Spray, we may not be able to obtain the necessary FDA clearance to continue to market and sell Avenova Spray without performing comprehensive clinical trials. In such event, we would need to seek premarket approval from the FDA for the applicable product before we could continue to sell and market Avenova Spray in the United States, which would be significantly more time consuming, expensive, and uncertain.\nOur commercialized products such as Avenova and DERMAdoctor branded products are not approved by the FDA as a drug, and we rely solely on the 510(k) clearance for Avenova Spray and certain of our other products as a medical device.\nOur business and future growth depend on the development, use and sale of products that are subject to FDA regulation, clearance and approval. Under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other laws, we are prohibited from promoting our products for off-label uses. This means that we may not make claims about the safety or effectiveness of our products and may not proactively discuss or provide information on the use of our products, except as allowed by the FDA. Our products, particularly our DERMAdoctor products, are also subject to regulation by the CPSC and the FTC. These laws and regulations principally relate to the ingredients, proper labeling, advertising, packaging, marketing, manufacture, safety, shipment and disposal of such products. As Avenova Spray is a medical device, we may only make very limited claims that pertain to its cleared intended use. Without claims of efficacy, market acceptance of our products may be slow. The 510(k) status of Avenova Spray also affects our ability to obtain formal insurance reimbursement by payors and affects our ability to obtain Medicare coverage.\nThe FDA does not currently require pre-market approval for products intended to be sold as non-prescription skincare products, so long as they are not marketed for the treatment or prevention of a disease, or as affecting the structure or function of the human body. However, the FDA may in the future require pre-market approval, clearance, or registration/notification of skincare products. Moreover, such products could also be regulated as both drugs and skincare simultaneously, as the categories are not mutually exclusive. If the FDA determines that any of our products intended to be sold as skincare should be classified and regulated as drug products, and we are unable to comply with applicable drug requirements, we may be unable to continue to market those products. Any inquiry into the regulatory status of our skincare products and any related interruption in the marketing and sale of these products could damage our reputation and image in the marketplace.\nThere is significant risk that the FDA or other federal or state law enforcement authorities may determine that the nature and scope of our sales and marketing activities constitutes the promotion of our products for non-FDA-approved uses in violation of applicable law and as the sale of unapproved drugs, which is prohibited under applicable law. We face the risk that the FDA may take enforcement action against us for the way that we promote and sell our products. This risk may grow with the increased visibility of Avenova Spray online, as well as the FDA\u2019s increased focus on antimicrobial products in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also face the risk that the FDA or other regulatory authorities might pursue enforcement actions based on past activities that we have discontinued or changed, including sales activities, arrangements with institutions and doctors, educational and training programs and other activities.\nGovernment investigations concerning the promotion of unapproved drug products, off-label uses and related issues are typically expensive, disruptive and burdensome and generate negative publicity. If our promotional activities are found to be in violation of applicable law or if we agree to a settlement in connection with an enforcement action, we would likely face significant fines and penalties and be required to substantially limit and change our sales and promotion activities.\nDevelopments after a product reaches the market may adversely affect sales of our products.\nEven after obtaining regulatory clearances, certain developments may decrease demand for our products, including the re-review of products that are already marketed; new scientific information and evolution of scientific theories; the recall or loss of regulatory clearance of products that are already marketed; changing government standards or public expectations regarding safety, efficacy, or labeling changes; and greater scrutiny in advertising and promotion. If previously unknown side effects are discovered or if there is an increase in negative publicity regarding known side effects of a product, it could significantly reduce demand for the product or require us to take actions that could negatively affect sales, including removing the product from the market, restricting its distribution or applying for labeling changes. In addition, some health authorities appear to have become more cautious when examining new products and are re-reviewing select products that are already marketed, adding further to the uncertainties in the regulatory processes.\nThere is also greater regulatory scrutiny, especially in the United States, on advertising (in particular, direct to consumer advertising), promotion and pricing of pharmaceutical products. Certain regulatory changes or decisions could make it more difficult for us to sell our products. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory clearance, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, injunctions, warning letters, criminal prosecution and other enforcement actions. Any of these events could prevent us from marketing our products and our business may not be able to continue past such concerns. If any of the above occurs to Avenova Spray, or our DERMAdoctor products, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe do not have our own manufacturing capacity, and we rely on partnering arrangements or third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of our products and potential products.\nThe FDA and other governmental authorities require that all of our products, including those of DERMAdoctor, be manufactured in strict compliance with federal Quality Systems Regulations (\u201cQSR\u201d) and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not currently operate manufacturing facilities for production of our products. As a result, we have partnered with third parties to manufacture our products or rely on contract manufacturers to supply, store and distribute our products and help us meet legal requirements. As we have limited control over our commercial partners, any performance failure on their part (including failure to deliver compliant, quality components or finished goods on a timely basis or properly branded products) could affect the commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and reducing or delaying product revenues. If any of our commercial partners or manufacturers have violated or is alleged to have violated any laws or regulations during the performance of their obligations to us, it is possible that we could suffer significant financial, operational and reputational harm or other negative outcomes, including costly corrective actions, including suspending manufacturing operations, changing product formulations, suspending sales of nonconforming products, or initiating product recalls, change product labelling, packaging or advertising or take other corrective action and possible legal consequences.\nOur products require precise, high-quality manufacturing. The failure to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards could result in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously harm our business. Contract manufacturers and partners often encounter difficulties involving production yields, quality control and quality assurance, as well as shortages of qualified personnel. Accordingly, we and our third-party manufacturers are also subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with the FDA's requirements, including primarily current cGMP, the QSR, medical device reporting regulations (where applicable for Avenova Spray), proper and compliant labeling and other applicable government regulations and corresponding foreign standards, including ISO 13485.\nThe results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on FDA\u2019s Form 483, untitled letters, warning letters, or other forms of enforcement. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our FDA-cleared products are ineffective, make additional therapeutic claims that are not commensurate to the accepted labeling claims, or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could take a number of regulatory actions, including preventing us from manufacturing any or all of our products or performing laboratory testing on human specimens, which could materially adversely affect our business. In addition, a prolonged interruption in the manufacturing of one or more of our products as a result of non-compliance could decrease our supply of products available for sale, which could reduce our net sales, gross profits and market share, as well as harm our overall business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nAvenova Spray\u2019s FDA-clearance and our other products that have been cleared by the FDA or products that we may obtain FDA-clearance in the future, if at all, are subject to limitations on the intended uses for which the product may be marketed, which can reduce our potential to successfully commercialize the product and generate revenue from the product. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials, labeling, training or other marketing or educational activities constitute promotion of an unapproved use, it could request that we cease or modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our training or other promotional materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities. In addition, we may be required to conduct costly post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or effectiveness of our products, and we must comply with medical device reporting requirements where applicable for Avenova Spray, including the reporting of adverse events and malfunctions related to our products. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, manufacturing problems, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements such as QSR, may result in changes to labeling, restrictions on such products or manufacturing processes, withdrawal of the products from the market, voluntary or mandatory recalls, a requirement to repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device we manufacture or distribute, fines, suspension of regulatory clearance to one or all of our products that may be cleared in the future, product seizures, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties which would adversely affect our business, operating results and prospects.\nIf we were to lose, or have restrictions imposed on, FDA clearances we may receive in the future, our business, operations, financial condition and results of operations would likely be materially adversely impacted.\nRisks Relating to Our Liquidity\nWe have a history of losses and we may never achieve or maintain sustained profitability.\nWe have historically incurred net losses, and we may never achieve or maintain sustained profitability. In addition, at this time, we expect to incur expenses, including marketing and sales expenses, as we integrate the DERMAdoctor business and its products with ours and our continued efforts to increase sales of our Avenova branded and newly acquired DERMAdoctor products, and our results of operations may fluctuate significantly.\nWhile we believe that increased revenues and operating expense efficiencies expected to be achieved as a result of the DERMAdoctor Acquisition will result in our Company achieving profitability, there is no assurance that this will occur. We will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability. Even with the combined sales of Avenova branded and DERMAdoctor products, there is no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient revenues to achieve or maintain profitability. Our failure to achieve and subsequently maintain profitability could have a material adverse impact on the market price of our Common Stock.\nRisks Relating to Owning Our Common Stock\nThe price of our Common Stock may fluctuate substantially, which may result in losses to our stockholders.\nThe stock prices of many companies in our market segments have generally experienced wide fluctuations, which are often unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. The market price of our Common Stock is likely to be volatile and could fluctuate in response to, among other things:\n\u25cf\nthe announcement of new products by us or our competitors\u037e\n\u25cf\nthe announcement of partnering arrangements by us or our competitors\u037e\n\u25cf\nquarterly variations in our or our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our earnings estimates, investors\u2019 perceptions, recommendations by securities analysts or our failure to achieve analysts' earnings estimates;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments in our industry;\n\u25cf\nthe sale of a substantial number of shares of Common Stock by any large stockholder, especially within a short period of time; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral, economic and market conditions, including volatility in the financial markets, a decrease in consumer confidence and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. Since our formation, we have raised capital through the issuance of capital stock on many occasions which, combined with the purchasing stockholders\u2019 subsequent disposition of those shares, may have resulted in one or more changes of control, as defined by Section 382 of the Code. We have not currently completed a study to assess whether any change of control has occurred, or whether there have been multiple changes of control since our formation, due to the significant complexity and cost associated with such study. If we have experienced a change of control at any time since our formation, our NOL carryforwards and tax credits may not be available, or their utilization could be subject to an annual limitation under Section 382. In addition, since we may need to raise additional funding to finance our operations, we may undergo further ownership changes in the future. If we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOL carryforwards to offset United States federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.\nWe have not paid dividends or repurchased stock in the past and do not expect to pay dividends or repurchase stock in the future, and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on, or repurchased shares of, our Common Stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends or repurchasing shares of our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, we do not anticipate paying any dividends or repurchasing any shares of our Preferred Stock; however, if we pay dividends on our shares of Common Stock, we are required to pay dividends on our Preferred Stock on an as converted basis. The payment of dividends on, or the repurchase of shares of, our Common Stock or Preferred Stock will depend on our earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our Board of Directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends or repurchase stock, holders of our Common Stock will experience a return on their investment in our shares only if our stock price appreciates.\nIf our stockholders' equity does not meet the minimum standards of the NYSE American or we are not able to comply with other continued listing requirements, we may be subject to delisting procedures.\nOur Common Stock is currently listed on the NYSE American. If we are unable to comply with the continued listing requirements of the NYSE American, our Common Stock would be delisted from the NYSE American, which would limit investors\u2019 ability to effect transactions in our Common Stock and subject us to additional trading restrictions. In order to maintain our listing, we must maintain certain share prices, financial and share distribution targets, including maintaining a minimum amount of stockholders\u2019 equity and a minimum number of public stockholders. In addition to these objective standards, NYSE American may delist the securities of any issuer for other reasons involving the judgment of NYSE American. Historically, our stockholders\u2019 equity has at times been below the minimum requirements of Section 1003(a) of the Company Guide though we have met all such minimum requirements since October 13, 2020. In accordance with Section 1009(h) of the Company Guide, if we are again determined to be below any of the continued listing standards in the future, the NYSE American will take the appropriate action which, depending on the circumstances, may include initiating its compliance procedures or initiating delisting proceedings. If our Common Stock is delisted, this could, among other things, substantially impair our ability to raise additional funds; result in a loss of institutional investor interest and fewer financing opportunities for us; and/or result in potential breaches of representations or covenants of our warrants, subscription agreements or other agreements pursuant to which we made representations or covenants relating to our compliance with applicable listing requirements. Claims related to any such breaches, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, significant liabilities and diversion of our management's time and attention and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, business and results of operations.\nWe may issue additional shares of our Common Stock, other series or classes of preferred stock or other equity securities without your approval, which would dilute your ownership interests and may depress the market price of your shares.\nWe may issue additional shares of our Common Stock, other series or classes of preferred stock, in addition to the Preferred Stock and 2021 Warrants that we recently issued and sold in the 2021 Private Placement, or other equity securities of equal or senior rank in the future in connection with, among other things, future acquisitions, repayment of outstanding indebtedness or under our 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan, without stockholder approval, in a number of circumstances.\nOur issuance of additional shares of our Common Stock, preferred stock or other equity securities of equal or senior rank could have the following effects:\n\u25cf\nyour proportionate ownership interest in NovaBay will decrease;\n\u25cf\nthe relative voting strength of each previously outstanding share of Common Stock may be diminished; or\n\u25cf\nthe market price of your shares of Common Stock may decline.\nWe may require additional capital funding, the receipt of which may impair the value of our Common Stock and Preferred Stock.\nIf we expand more rapidly than currently anticipated or if our working capital needs exceed our current expectations, we may need to raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings or debt financings. Our future capital requirements depend on many factors including our research, development, sales and marketing activities. We do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed or will be available on terms favorable to us. If we cannot raise needed funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution and the new equity securities may have greater rights, preferences or privileges than our existing Common Stock. In addition, the new equity securities may be offered in the future at a price that is below the then in effect conversion price of the Preferred Stock, which would result in the lowering of the conversion price of the Preferred Stock and a greater number of shares of Common Stock being issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock for no additional consideration, causing even greater dilution to our stockholders.\nOffers or availability for sale of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock, including as a result of the conversion of the Preferred Stock and/or the exercise of the 2021 Warrants, may cause the price of our publicly traded securities to decline.\nSales of a significant number of shares of our Common Stock in the public market could harm the market price of our Common Stock and make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of Common Stock. The Preferred Stock that we issued in the 2021 Private Placement provides for conversion into an aggregate of 37,500,000 shares of Common Stock (based on the current conversion price). In addition, the Preferred Stock may become convertible into a greater number of shares of Common Stock that would be available for sale as a result of the full-ratchet anti-dilution price protection in the Certificate of Designation for the Preferred Stock, which would be triggered if we were to issue Common Stock in the future at an effective Common Stock purchase price that is less than the current conversion price for the Preferred Stock. In the 2021 Private Placement, we also issued 2021 Warrants that are exercisable into 37,500,000 shares of Common Stock. Assuming that all of the shares of Preferred Stock issued in the 2021 Private Placement are converted based on the conversion price as of the date hereof, and all of the 2021 Warrants are exercised, it would result in a total of 75,000,000 additional shares of Common Stock becoming issued and outstanding, which represents approximately 50% of the total number of shares of Common Stock authorized as of January 31, 2022. In addition, our stockholders and the holders of our stock options and other warrants that we issued may also sell amounts of our Common Stock in the public market. The sale of a significant portion of any of these shares of Common Stock in the public market at one time could create downward pressure on the market price of our Common Stock. In addition, the fact that our stockholders, including the holders of Preferred Stock, option holders and warrant holders, including the 2021 Warrants, could sell substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public market, whether or not sales have occurred or are occurring, could make it more difficult for us to raise additional financing through the sale of equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and/or at a price that we deem reasonable or appropriate, or at all.\nRisks Related to Potential Litigation\nThe pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by patent litigation, and any litigation or claim against us may impose substantial costs on us, place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our business and harm our reputation.\nThere has been substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries with respect to the manufacture, use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights. For the most part, these lawsuits relate to the validity, enforceability, and infringement of patents. We rely upon patents, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position, and we may initiate claims to defend our intellectual property rights as a result. Other parties may have issued patents or be issued patents that may prevent the sale of our products or know-how or require us to license such patents and pay significant fees or royalties to produce our products. In addition, future patents may be issued to third parties which our technology may infringe. Because patent applications can take many years to issue and because patent applications are not published for a period of time, or in some cases at all, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that our products infringe.\nIntellectual property litigation, regardless of outcome, is expensive and time-consuming, would divert management's attention from our business and could have a material negative effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition. If a dispute involving our proprietary technology were resolved against us, it could mean the earlier entry of some or all third parties seeking to compete in the marketplace for a given product, and a consequent significant decrease in the price we could charge for our product. If such a dispute alleging that our technology or operations infringed third-party patent rights were to be resolved against us, we might be required to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorney's fees if we were found to have willfully infringed a third party's patent, to the party claiming infringement, to develop non-infringing technology, to stop selling any products we develop, to cease using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property or to enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable or commercially practical terms, if at all.\nIf our product or products cause an unexpected reaction to a patient or patients in certain ways that may have caused or contributed to serious injury, we may be subject to product liability claims, and if product liability lawsuits are brought against us, they could result in costly litigation and significant liabilities.\nDespite all reasonable efforts to ensure safety, it is possible that we or our distributors will sell our products or products that we currently do not sell but may sell in the future, which are defective, to which patients/customers react in an unexpected manner, or which are alleged to have side effects or otherwise not work for the product\u2019s intended purpose. The manufacture and sale of such products may expose us to potential liability, including regulatory enforcement actions, and the industries in which our products are likely to be sold have been subject to significant product liability litigation.\nAny claims, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, reduced sales, significant liabilities and diversion of our management's time and attention, and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, business and results of operations. We cannot make assurances that any liability insurance coverage that we qualify for, if at all, will fully satisfy any liabilities brought for any event or injury that is attributed to our product or products.\nIf a product liability claim is brought against us, we may be required to pay legal and other expenses to defend the claim and, if the claim is successful, damage awards may not be covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance. We may not have sufficient capital resources to pay a judgment, in which case our creditors could levy against our assets. We may also be obligated to indemnify our collaborators and make payments to other parties with respect to product liability damages and claims. Defending any product liability claims, or indemnifying others against those claims, could require us to expend significant financial and managerial resources.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, our competitors could develop and market products similar to ours that may reduce demand for our products.\nOur success, competitive position and potential future revenues will depend in significant part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on the patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the U.S. and other countries, as well as confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements, to protect our intellectual property rights. We apply for patents covering our technologies as we deem appropriate.\nThere is no assurance that any patents issued to us, or in-licensed or assigned to us by third parties will not be challenged, invalidated, found unenforceable or circumvented, or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us. If we or our collaborators or licensors fail to file, prosecute, obtain or maintain certain patents, our competitors could market products that contain features and clinical benefits similar to those of any products we develop, and demand for our products could decline as a result. Further, although we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology, third parties may be able to design around our patents or, if they do infringe upon our technology, we may not be successful or have sufficient resources in pursuing a claim of infringement against those third parties. Any pursuit of an infringement claim by us may involve substantial expense and diversion of management attention.\nWe also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and collaborators. If these agreements are not enforceable, or are breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and our trade secrets and proprietary know-how may become known or be independently discovered by competitors.\nWe operate in the State of California. California law prevents us from imposing a delay before an employee, who may have access to trade secrets and proprietary know-how, can commence employment with a competing company. Although we may be able to pursue legal action against competitive companies improperly using our proprietary information, we may not be aware of any use of our trade secrets and proprietary know-how until after significant damage has been done to our Company.\nFurthermore, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. If our intellectual property does not provide significant protection against foreign or domestic competition, our competitors, including generic manufacturers, could compete more directly with us, which could result in a decrease in our market share. All of these factors may harm our competitive position.", "PERMNO": 92345, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "NBY"}
