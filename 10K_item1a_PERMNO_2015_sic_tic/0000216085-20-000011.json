RISK FACTORS\nThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this annual report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d (MD&A), and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8. \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nWe routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different - sometimes materially different - than we presently anticipate. The following factors, as well as others described elsewhere in this report or in our other filings with the SEC, that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results should be carefully considered. Below, we describe certain important operational and strategic risks and uncertainties, but they are not the only risks we face. Our reactions to material future developments, as well as our competitors\u2019 reactions to those developments, may also impact our business operations or financial results. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected.\nChanges in economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our products.\nA large portion of our sales represent discretionary spending by our customers. Demand for our products is generally affected by a number of economic factors including, but not limited to: interest rates, housing starts, sales of new and existing homes, housing values, the level of mortgage refinancing, consumer confidence, debt levels and retail trends. Declining stock market values, rising food and energy costs, and higher personal taxes adversely affect demand. A decline in economic activity and conditions in the markets in which we operate would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face significant competition from national, regional and local retailers of home furnishings.\nThe retail market for home furnishings is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. We currently compete against a diverse group of retailers, including internet only retailers, regional or independent specialty stores, dedicated franchises of furniture manufacturers and national department stores. National mass merchants and electronics and appliance retailers also have limited product offerings. In addition, there are few barriers to entry into our current and contemplated markets, and new competitors may enter our current or future markets at any time. Our existing competitors or new entrants into our industry may use a number of different strategies to compete against us, including aggressive advertising, pricing and marketing, and extension of credit to customers on terms more favorable than we offer.\nCompetition from any of these sources could cause us to lose market share, revenues and customers, increase expenditures or reduce prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we fail to anticipate changes in consumer preferences, our sales may decline.\nOur products must appeal to our target consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. Our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to fashion trends relating to home furnishings. If we fail to identify and respond to these changes, our sales may decline.\nWe import a substantial portion of our merchandise from foreign sources. This exposes us to certain risks that include political and economic conditions. In an effort to discourage U.S. corporations from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions and curb what are considered to be unfair trade practices, the United States imposed tariffs on goods manufactured in China. The tariffs began in September 2018 at 10% of product costs and increased to 25% on March 4, 2019. If the tariffs are increased further or new tariffs on goods produced in other countries were enacted this could adversely affect our results of operations or profitability.\nBased on product costs, approximately 59% of our total furniture purchases (which exclude accessories and mattresses) in 2019 were for goods not produced domestically, of which approximately 15% were for goods produced in China. All our purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. As exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and certain other currencies become unfavorable, the likelihood of price increases from our vendors increases. Some of the products we purchase are also subject to tariffs. If tariffs are imposed on additional products or the tariff rates are increased our vendors may increase their prices. Such changes, if they occur, could have one or more of the following impacts:\n\u2022\nwe could be forced to raise retail prices so high that we are unable to sell the products at current unit volumes;\n\u2022\nif we are unable to raise retail prices commensurately with the cost increases, gross profit as recognized under our LIFO inventory accounting method could be negatively impacted; or\n\u2022\nwe may be forced to find alternative sources of comparable product, which may be more expensive than the current product, of lower quality, or the vendor may be unable to meet our requirements for quality, quantities, delivery schedules or other key terms.\nSignificant fluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and components could adversely affect our profits.\nThe primary materials our vendors use to produce and manufacture our products are various woods and wood products, resin, steel, leather, cotton, and certain oil-based products. On a global and regional basis, the sources and prices of those materials and components are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supply/demand trends, transportation costs, government regulations and tariffs, changes in currency exchange rates, price controls, the economic and political climate, and other unforeseen circumstances. Significant increases in these and other costs in the future could materially affect our vendors\u2019 costs and our profits as discussed above.\nWe are dependent upon the ability of our third-party producers, many of whom are located in foreign countries, to meet our requirements; any failures by these producers to meet our requirements, or the unavailability of suitable producers at reasonable prices or limitations on our ability to source from certain third-party producers may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis or result in higher costs or reduced net sales.\nWe source substantially all of our products from non-exclusive, third-party producers, many of which are located in foreign countries. Although we have long-term relationships with many of our suppliers, we must compete with other companies for the production capacity of these independent manufacturers. We regularly depend upon the ability of third-party producers to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials, a skilled workforce, adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity. Although we monitor production and quality in many third-party manufacturing locations, we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers, such as the reduction of availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs. Such difficulties may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis, which may, in turn, have a negative impact on our customer relationships and result in lower net sales.\nWe also require third-party producers to meet certain standards in terms of working conditions, environmental protection and other matters before placing business with them. As a result of costs relating to compliance with these standards, we may pay higher prices than some of our competitors for products. In addition, failure by our independent manufacturers to adhere to labor or other laws or business practices accepted as ethical, and the potential litigation, negative publicity and political pressure relating to any of these events, could disrupt our operations or harm our reputation.\nOur vendors might fail in meeting our quality control standards or reacting to changes to the legislative or regulatory framework regarding product safety.\nAll of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and regulations, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. Any actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in recalls and other liabilities. These could harm our brand's image and negatively affect our business and operating results.\nOur revenue could be adversely affected by risks in our supply chain.\nOptimal product flow is dependent on demand planning and forecasting, production to plan by suppliers, and timely transportation. We often make commitments to purchase products from our vendors in advance of proposed production dates. Significant deviation from the projected demand for products that we sell may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, either from lost sales or lower margins due to the need to reduce prices to dispose of excess inventory. Disruptions to our supply chain could result in late arrivals of product. This could negatively affect sales due to increased levels of out-of-stock merchandise and loss of confidence by customers in our ability to deliver goods as promised.\nWe face risks associated with our overseas suppliers including, but not limited to, political or economic instability, geopolitical events, environmental events, widespread health emergencies, such as the novel coronavirus, natural disasters, or social and labor unrest.\nIn addition, there is a risk that compliance lapses by our foreign manufacturers could occur which could lead to investigations by U.S. government agencies responsible for international trade compliance. Resulting penalties or enforcement actions could delay future imports or otherwise negatively impact our business. There also remains a risk that one or more of our foreign manufacturers will not adhere to applicable legal requirements or our compliance standards such as fair labor standards, the prohibition on child labor and other product safety or manufacturing safety standards. The violation of applicable legal requirements, including labor, manufacturing and safety laws, by any of our manufacturers, the failure of any of our manufacturers to adhere to our global compliance standards or the divergence of the labor practices followed by any of our manufacturers from those generally accepted in the U.S., could disrupt our supply of products from our manufacturers, result in potential liability to us and harm our reputation and brand, any of which could negatively affect our business and operating results.\nThe rise of oil and gasoline prices could affect our profitability.\nA significant increase in oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect our profitability. In addition, governmental efforts to combat climate change through reduction of greenhouse gases may result in higher fuel costs through taxation or other means. We deliver substantially all of our customers\u2019 purchases to their homes. Our distribution system, which utilizes three DCs and multiple home delivery centers is very transportation dependent to reach the 22 states we deliver to from our stores across 16 Southern and Midwestern states.\nIf transportation costs exceed amounts we are able to effectively pass on to the consumer, either by higher prices and/or higher delivery charges, then our profitability will suffer.\nBecause of our limited number of distribution centers, should one become damaged, our operating results could suffer.\nWe utilize three large distribution centers to flow our merchandise from the vendor to the consumer. This system is very efficient for reducing inventory requirements but makes us operationally vulnerable should one of these facilities become damaged.\nOur information technology infrastructure is vulnerable to damage that could harm our business.\nOur ability to operate our business from day to day, in particular our ability to manage our point-of-sale, distribution system and credit operations, largely depends on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems. We use management information systems to communicate customer information, provide real-time inventory information, manage our credit portfolio and to handle all facets of our distribution system from receipt of goods in the DCs to delivery to our customers\u2019 homes.\nThe failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with integrating various data sources, challenges in transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, difficulty in integrating new systems, or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of our business.\nCyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cyber threats and cyber-attackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of single \"hackers\" or small groups of \"hackers.\"\nWe invest in industry standard security technology to protect the Company\u2019s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber-attack. Our data security management program includes identity, trust, vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies. We measure our data security effectiveness through industry accepted methods. We are continuously installing new and upgrading existing information technology systems. We use employee awareness training around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks to ensure that the Company is protected, to the greatest extent possible, against cyber risks and security breaches. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact. Insider or employee cyber and security threats are increasingly a concern for all companies, including ours. Additionally, we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards.\nNevertheless, as cyber threats evolve, change and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber-attacks might defeat our or a third-party service provider's security measures in the future and obtain the personal information of customers or employees. Employee error or other irregularities may also result in a failure of security measures and a breach of information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security.\nA security breach and loss of information may not be discovered for a significant period of time after it occurs. While we have no knowledge of a material security breach to date, any compromise of data security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws or standards, the loss of valuable business data, or a disruption of our business. A security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information could give rise to unwanted media attention, materially damage our customer relationships and reputation, and result in fines, fees, or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies.", "PERMNO": 41217, "SIC": 5712, "TIC": "HVT"}
