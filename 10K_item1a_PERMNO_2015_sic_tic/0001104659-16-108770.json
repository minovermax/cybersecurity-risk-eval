Risk Factors.\nWe could be subject to complex and costly regulatory activities. Our business could suffer if we or our suppliers encounter manufacturing problems. We could be subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the U.S. Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nYou should carefully consider the following material risks facing us. If any of these risks occur, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially affected.\nWe Compete in an Anticompetitive Marketplace\nWe operate in an environment that is dominated by BD, the major syringe manufacturer in the U.S. We initiated a lawsuit in 2007 against BD. The suit was for patent infringement, antitrust practices, and false advertising. The court severed the patent claims from the other claims pending resolution of the patent dispute. The antitrust and false advertising claims resulted in a final judgment for $352 million plus prejudgment and post-judgment interest as well as some injunctive relief. We have not received any of the amounts indicated by the District Court in its final judgment. BD has appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Oral argument was heard on February 29, 2016 and we are still waiting for the appellate decision.\nAlthough we have made limited progress in some areas, such as the alternate care and some international markets, our volumes are not as high as they should be given the nature and quality of our products and the federal and state legislation requiring the use of safe needle devices. We believe this is due to the anticompetitive market, despite our litigation efforts described briefly above.\nWe Have Generally Been Unable to Gain Sufficient Market Access to Achieve Profitable Operations\nWe have a history of incurring net operating losses. We may experience operating losses in the future. If we are unable to gain sufficient market access and market share, we may be unable to continue to finance research and development as well as support operations and expansion of production.\nWe Are Dependent on Our Patent Protection\nOur main competitive strength is our technology. We are dependent on patent rights, and if the patent rights are invalidated or circumvented, our business would be adversely affected. Patent protection is considered, in the aggregate, to be of material importance in the design, development, and marketing of products.\nThe Company holds exclusive rights under domestic and foreign patents and has pending applications related to the technology embodied in products that are currently marketed. The Company also holds rights related to new products under development. The patents exclusively licensed by the Company have varying remaining terms and expiration dates. While patents covering some features of the VanishPoint\u00ae syringes have recently expired or will expire during 2016, another patent with a later expiration date will continue to provide patent coverage for VanishPoint\u00ae syringes until 2020.\nPatent life may be extended, not through the original patents, but through related improvements. As our technology ages (and the associated patent life expires), our competitive position in the marketplace could weaken. The patent protection may decrease and make us vulnerable to other competitors utilizing our technology.\nWe do not maintain patent or trademark protection in all foreign countries, but, where possible, have taken steps to protect our patents and trademarks in those countries where we routinely conduct a material amount of business. Our lack of patent and trademark protection, particularly in certain foreign countries, heightens the risk that our designs may be copied by a competitor.\nOur Patents Are Subject to Litigation\nWe have been sued by BD and MDC Investment Holdings, Inc. for patent infringement. This case is has been administratively closed until the appeal is resolved in our case against BD. Patent litigation and challenges involving our patents are costly and unpredictable and may deprive us of market exclusivity for a patented product or, in some cases, third party patents may prevent us from marketing and selling a product in a particular geographic area.\nWe Are Vulnerable to New Technologies\nBecause we have a narrow focus on particular product lines and technology (currently predominantly retractable needle products), we are vulnerable to the development of superior competing products and to changes in technology which could eliminate or reduce the need for our products. If a superior technology is created, the demand for our products could greatly diminish.\nOur Competitors Have Greater Resources\nOur competitors have greater financial resources, larger and more established sales and marketing and distribution organizations, and greater market influence, including long-term contracts. These competitors may be able to use these resources to improve their products through research and acquisitions or develop new products, which may compete more effectively with our products. If our competitors choose to use their resources to create products superior to ours, we may be unable to sell our products and our ability to continue operations would be weakened.\nThe Majority of Our Sales Are Filled Using One Third Party Manufacturer\nMost international syringe sales, as well as a substantial portion of domestic sales, are filled by production from a Chinese manufacturer. In the event that we become unable to purchase such product from our Chinese manufacturer, we would need to find an alternate manufacturer for the 0.5mL insulin syringe, the 0.5mL autodisable syringe, and the 2mL, 5mL, and 10mL syringes and we would increase domestic production for the 1mL and 3mL syringes. Even with increased domestic production, we may not be able to avoid a disruption in supply. In 2015, the 1mL and 3mL syringes made up 94.5% of our unit sales and 91.5% of our revenues.\nFluctuations in Supplies of Inventory Could Temporarily Increase Costs\nFluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials and inventory and the ability to maintain favorable third party manufacturing arrangements and relationships could result in the need to manufacture all of our products in the U.S. This could temporarily increase unit costs as we ramp up domestic production.\nWe Are Controlled by One Shareholder\nThomas J. Shaw, our President and Chief Executive Officer, would have investment or voting power over a total of 49.5% of the outstanding Common Stock if he exercised his options as of March 1, 2016. Mr. Shaw will, therefore, have the ability to direct our operations and financial affairs and to substantially influence the election of members of our Board of Directors. His interests may not always coincide with the Company\u2019s interests or the interests of other stockholders. This concentration of ownership, for example, may have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover, or other business\ncombination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could materially adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. Mr. Shaw\u2019s rights under the Technology License Agreement, as the owner of the technology we produce, present similar conflicts of interest.\nCurrent Economic Conditions May Decrease Collectability of Accounts\nAlthough we believe that we have granted credit to credit-worthy firms, current economic conditions may affect the timing and/or collectability of some accounts.\nWe Face Inherent Product Liability Risks\nAs a manufacturer and provider of safety needle products, we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims. If a product liability claim is made and damages are in excess of our product liability coverage, our competitive position could be weakened by the amount of money we could be required to pay to compensate those injured by our products. In the event of a recall, we have recall insurance.", "PERMNO": 88994, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "RVP"}
