RISK FACTORS\nMaking or continuing an investment in securities, including the Company\u2019s Common Stock, involves certain risks that you should carefully consider. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks that may have a material adverse effect on the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties also could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be affected, the market price for your securities could decline, and you could lose all or a part of your investment. Further, to the extent that any of the information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitutes forward-looking statements, the risk factors set forth below also are cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company.\nWe may be vulnerable to certain sectors of the economy.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate. If the economy deteriorates and real estate values depress beyond a certain point, as happened during the recent recession, the collateral value of the portfolio and the revenue stream from those loans could come under stress and possibly require additional loan loss accruals which would negatively impact our earnings. Our ability to dispose of foreclosed real estate at prices above the respective carrying values could also be adversely affected, causing additional losses.\nDifficult market conditions in past years have adversely affected the industry in which we operate.\nThe capital and credit markets are subject to volatility and disruption. Dramatic declines in the housing market in years past caused home prices to fall and increased foreclosures, unemployment and under-employment. These events, if they were to happen again, could negatively impact the credit performance of mortgage loans and result in significant write-downs of asset values, including government-sponsored entities as well as major commercial and investment banks. Still wary about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties, many lenders still have reduced funding to borrowers, including to other financial institutions. Market turmoil and tightening of credit could lead to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence and widespread reduction of business activity generally. A worsening of these conditions would have an adverse effect on us and others in the financial institution industry generally, particularly in our real estate markets, as lower home prices and increased foreclosures would result in higher charge-offs and delinquencies.\nGeneral economic conditions in the areas where our operations or loans are concentrated may adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability to meet their obligations.\nA sudden or severe downturn in the economy in the geographic markets we serve in the states of Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama or Florida may affect the ability of our customers to meet loan payment obligations on a timely basis. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on our commercial, real estate, and construction loans, the ability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing such loans. Changes resulting in adverse economic conditions of these market areas could negatively impact the financial results of the Company\u2019s banking operations, earnings, and profitability.\nAdditionally, adverse economic changes may cause customers to withdraw deposit balances, thereby causing a strain on our liquidity.\nWe are subject to a risk of rapid and significant changes in market interest rates.\nOur assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature, and as a result we are subject to significant risks tied to changes in interest rates. Our ability to operate profitably is largely dependent upon net interest income. Unexpected movement in interest rates markedly changing the slope of the current yield curve could cause net interest margins to decrease, subsequently decreasing net interest income. In addition, such changes could adversely affect the valuation of our assets and liabilities.\nAt present the Company\u2019s one-year interest rate sensitivity position is slightly asset sensitive, but a gradual increase in interest rates during the next twelve months should not have a significant impact on net interest income during that period. However, as with most financial institutions, the Company\u2019s results of operations are affected by changes in interest rates and the Company\u2019s ability to manage this risk. The difference between interest rates charged on interest-earning assets and interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities may be affected by changes in market interest rates, changes in relationships between interest rate indices, and/or changes in the relationships between long-term and short-term market interest rates. A change in this difference might result in an increase in interest expense relative to interest income, or a decrease in the Company\u2019s interest rate spread.\nCertain changes in interest rates, inflation, or the financial markets could affect demand for our products and our ability to deliver products efficiently.\nLoan originations, and therefore loan revenues, could be adversely impacted by sharply rising interest rates. Conversely, sharply falling rates could increase prepayments within our loan and securities portfolio lowering interest earnings from those assets. An unanticipated increase in inflation could cause operating costs related to salaries and benefits, technology, and supplies to increase at a faster pace than revenues.\nThe fair market value of the securities portfolio and the investment income from these securities also fluctuates depending on general economic and market conditions. In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations.\nChanges in the policies of monetary authorities and other government action could adversely affect profitability.\nThe results of operations of the Company are affected by credit policies of monetary authorities, particularly the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which we refer to as the Federal Reserve Board. The instruments of monetary policy employed by the Federal Reserve Board include open market operations in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate or the federal funds rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, we cannot predict possible future changes in interest rates, deposit levels, loan demand or the Company\u2019s business and earnings. Furthermore, the actions of the United States government and other governments in responding to developing situations or implementing new fiscal or trade policies may result in currency fluctuations, exchange controls, market disruption and other adverse effects.\nNatural disasters could affect our ability to operate.\nOur market areas are susceptible to natural disasters such as hurricanes and tornados. Natural disasters can disrupt operations, result in damage to properties that may be securing our loan assets and negatively affect the local economies in which we operate. We cannot predict whether or to what extent damage caused by future hurricanes, tornados or other natural disasters will affect operations or the economies in our market areas, but such weather events could cause a decline in loan originations, a decline in the value or destruction of properties securing the loans and an increase in the risk of delinquencies, foreclosures or loan losses.\nGreater loan losses than expected may adversely affect our earnings.\nThe First, as lender, is exposed to the risk that its customers will be unable to repay their loans in accordance with their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans may not be sufficient to assure repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and could have a material adverse effect on operating results. Credit risk with respect to our real estate and construction loan portfolio will relate principally to the creditworthiness of corporations and the value of the real estate serving as security for the repayment of loans. Credit risk with respect to its commercial and consumer loan portfolio will relate principally to the general creditworthiness of businesses and individuals within our local markets.\nThe First makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of its loan portfolio and provides an allowance for estimated loan losses based on a number of factors. The First believes that its current allowance for loan losses is adequate. However, if our assumptions or judgments prove to be incorrect, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses. We may have to increase the allowance in the future in response to the request of one of our primary banking regulators, to adjust for changing conditions and assumptions, or as a result of any deterioration in the quality of the loan portfolio. The actual amount of future provisions for loan losses cannot be determined at this time and may vary from the amounts of past provisions.\nWe may need to rely on the financial markets to provide needed capital.\nOur common stock is listed and traded on the NASDAQ stock market. Although we anticipate that our capital resources will be adequate for the foreseeable future to meet our capital requirements, at times we may depend on the liquidity of the NASDAQ stock market to raise equity capital. If the market should fail to operate, or if conditions in the capital markets are adverse, we may be constrained in raising capital. Should these risks materialize, the ability to further expand our operations through organic or acquisitive growth may be limited.\nWe are subject to regulation by various Federal and State entities.\nThe Company and The First are subject to the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the OCC. New regulations issued by these agencies may adversely affect our ability to carry on our business activities. The Company is subject to various Federal and state laws and certain changes in these laws and regulations may adversely affect operations.\nThe Company and The First are also subject to the accounting rules and regulations of the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Changes in accounting rules could adversely affect the reported financial statements or results of operations of the Company and may also require extraordinary efforts or additional costs to implement. Any of these laws or regulations may be modified or changed from time to time, and we cannot be assured that such modifications or changes will not adversely affect the Company.\nWe may engage in acquisitions of other businesses from time to time, which may not be well-received.\nOn occasion, we may engage in acquisitions of other businesses. Difficulty in integrating an acquired business or company may cause us not to realize expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, or other anticipated benefits from any acquisition. The integration could result in higher than expected deposit attrition (run-off), loss of key employees, disruption of the Company\u2019s business or the business of the acquired company, or otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. The acquired companies may also have legal contingencies, beyond those that we are aware of, that could result in unexpected costs. The Company may need to make additional investment in equipment and personnel to manage higher asset levels and loan balances as a result of any significant acquisition, which may adversely impact earnings.\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated cost savings and other financial benefits of the Iberville Bank Acquisition and Gulf Coast Acquisition on the anticipated schedule, if at all..\nThe First, Iberville Bank, and Gulf Coast have historically operated independently. The success of the mergers of Iberville Bank and Gulf Coast into The First will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine the businesses of The First, Iberville Bank, and Gulf Coast. To realize these anticipated benefits, The First expects to integrate Iberville Bank\u2019s and Gulf Coast\u2019s businesses with its own businesses. We may face significant challenges in integrating both Iberville Bank\u2019s and Gulf Coast\u2019s operations into our operations in a timely and efficient manner and in retaining personnel from these two banks that we anticipate needing. Achieving the anticipated cost savings and financial benefits of the mergers will depend, in part, on whether we can successfully integrate these businesses. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors, and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. In addition, the integration of certain operations following the mergers will require the dedication of significant management resources, which may temporarily distract management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day business of the combined company. Any inability to realize the full extent of, or any of, the anticipated cost savings and financial benefits of the mergers, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect on the business and results of operations of the combined company, which may affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to industry competition which may have an adverse impact upon our success.\nThe profitability of the Company depends on its ability to compete successfully with other financial services companies. We operate in a highly competitive financial services environment. Certain competitors are larger and may have more resources than we do. We face competition in our regional market areas from other commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, internet banks, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms, and other financial intermediaries that offer similar services. Some of the nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern the Company or The First and may have greater flexibility in competing for business.\nThe First faces increased competition from both federally-chartered and state-chartered financial and thrift institutions, as well as credit unions, consumer finance companies, insurance companies, and other institutions in The First's market area. Some of these competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulation and restriction imposed upon The First. Many of these competitors also have broader geographic markets and substantially greater resources and lending limits than The First and offer certain services such as trust banking that The First does not currently provide. In addition, many of these competitors have numerous branch offices located throughout the extended market areas of The First that may provide these competitors with an advantage in geographic convenience that The First does not have at present. Currently there are numerous other commercial banks, savings institutions, and credit unions operating in The First's primary service area.\nWe also compete with numerous financial and quasi-financial institutions for deposits and loans, including providers of financial services over the internet. Recent technology advances and other changes have allowed parties to effectuate financial transactions that previously required the involvement of banks. For example, consumers can maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries, known as \u201cdisintermediation,\u201d could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and access to lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture issuances of additional securities could result in dilution of shareholders\u2019 ownership.\nWe may determine from time to time to issue additional securities to raise additional capital, support growth, or to make acquisitions. Further, we may issue stock options or other stock grants to retain and motivate our employees. Such issuances of our securities could dilute the ownership interests of the Company\u2019s shareholders.\nAnti-takeover laws and certain agreements and charter provisions may adversely affect share value.\nCertain provisions of state and federal law and our articles of incorporation may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of the Company. Under federal law, subject to certain exemptions, a person, entity, or group must notify the federal banking agencies before acquiring 10% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a bank holding company, including the Company\u2019s shares. Banking agencies review the acquisition to determine if it will result in a change of control. The banking agencies have 60 days to act on the notice, and take into account several factors, including the resources of the acquiror and the antitrust effects of the acquisition. There also are Mississippi statutory provisions and provisions in our articles of incorporation that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt. As a result, these statutory provisions and provisions in our articles of incorporation could result in the Company being less attractive to a potential acquiror.\nSecurities issued by the Company, including the Company\u2019s common stock, are not FDIC insured.\nSecurities issued by the Company, including the Company\u2019s common stock, are not savings or deposit accounts or other obligations of any bank and are not insured by the FDIC, the Deposit Insurance Fund, or any other governmental agency or instrumentality, or any private insurer, and are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal.\nThe failure of other financial institutions could adversely affect the Company.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and potential failures of other financial institutions. Financial institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or concerns about, one or more financial institutions or the financial services industry generally have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by the Company or by other institutions.\nConcern by customers over deposit insurance may cause a decrease in deposits and changes in the mix of funding sources available to the Company.\nWith increased concerns about bank failures during and after the recent recession, customers increasingly are concerned about the extent to which their deposits are insured by the FDIC. Customers may withdraw deposits in an effort to ensure that the amount they have on deposit with their bank is fully insured and some may seek deposit products or other bank savings and investment products that are collateralized. Decreases in deposits and changes in the mix of funding sources may adversely affect the Company\u2019s funding costs and net income.\nEvaluation of investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment involves subjective determinations and could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe evaluation of impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties, and is intended to determine whether declines in the fair value of investments should be recognized in current period earnings. The risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions, the issuers\u2019 financial condition or future recovery prospects, the effects of changes in interest rates or credit spreads and the expected recovery period. Estimating future cash flows involves incorporating information received from third-party sources and making internal assumptions and judgments regarding the future performance of the underlying collateral and assessing the probability that an adverse change in future cash flows has occurred. The determination of the amount of other-than-temporary impairments is based upon the Company\u2019s quarterly evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\nAdditionally, our management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its reasonable judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for recovery. Inherent in management\u2019s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Impairments to the carrying value of our investment securities may need to be taken in the future, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be required to pay additional insurance premiums to the FDIC, which could negatively impact earnings.\nPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the limit on FDIC coverage has been permanently increased to $250,000, causing the premiums assessed to The First by the FDIC to increase. Depending upon any future losses that the FDIC insurance fund may suffer, there can be no assurance that there will not be additional premium increases in order to replenish the fund. The FDIC may need to set a higher base rate schedule or impose special assessments due to future financial institution failures and updated failure and loss projections. Potentially higher FDIC assessment rates than those currently projected could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWith the completion of the acquisitions of Iberville Bank and Gulf Coast, the market price of our common stock may be affected by factors different from those historically affecting our independent operations through The First.\nThe historic businesses of each of The First, Iberville Bank, and Gulf Coast differ in important respects, and accordingly, the results of operations of the combined company and the market price of the combined company\u2019s shares of common stock may be affected by factors different from those historically affecting the independent results of operations of The First, Iberville Bank, and Gulf Coast.\nThe impact of flooding events in Louisiana and southwest Mississippi in 2016 on our market areas and those of Iberville Bank is presently unknown.\nThe First (including through the legacy operations of Iberville Bank) has a physical presence and collateral securing loans in or near parts of Louisiana and Mississippi that were affected by the late summer 2016 significant flooding in those areas. The First has worked diligently to assess and quantify the impact, if any, of this flooding on their respective businesses. While The First believes that any impact on their respective businesses has already been or will be adequately accounted for, either through the presence of insurance, special loan provisions, or otherwise, there can be no assurances that such measures will be appropriate or adequate. If the residual impact from such flooding is more significant on the businesses of The First, then the results of operations or financial condition of The First could be negatively impacted. If the impact from the flooding is more adverse than believed, the anticipated benefits from the Iberville Bank Acquisition may not be realized or realized to a lesser extent, and might have an adverse effect on the combined company and our Common Stock following such merger.", "PERMNO": 91274, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FBMS"}
