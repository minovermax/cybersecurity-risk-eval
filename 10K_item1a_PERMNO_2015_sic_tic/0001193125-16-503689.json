{"cik": "874396", "company": "LIFETIME BRANDS, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s businesses, operations, liquidity and financial condition are subject to various risks. The Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation could be significantly affected by the risks below or additional risks not presently known to the Company or by risks that the Company presently deems immaterial such as changes in the economy, disruptions due to terrorist activity or manmade or natural disasters, or changes in law or accounting standards. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that the Company considers material.\nThe Company has substantial indebtedness and the Company\u2019s business is highly seasonal.\nThe Company has a substantial amount of indebtedness and is dependent on the availability of its bank loan facilities to finance its liquidity needs. The Company\u2019s Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A, as Administrative Agent and Co-Collateral Agent, and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as Syndication Agent and Co-Collateral Agent (as amended, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) provides for, among other things, a Revolving Credit Facility commitment totaling $175.0 million (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) and a term loan facility of $35.0 million at December 31, 2015 (\u201cTerm Loan\u201d). As of December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $100.9 million of consolidated debt, including $100.6 million under the Credit Agreement, representing approximately 25% of total capital (indebtedness plus stockholders\u2019 equity). The Company may borrow under its Revolving Credit Facility, subject to the limitations of a borrowing base. Because the borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility depends on levels of eligible inventory, accounts receivable and the appraised value of certain intellectual property that fluctuate from time to time, the full commitment amount may not represent actual borrowing capacity. The financial covenants governing the Company\u2019s Term Loan agreement limit its ability to incur senior indebtedness. The Company may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of, interest on, or other amounts due with respect to, its indebtedness. In addition, the Company\u2019s business is seasonal with a significant amount of its revenue being realized during the latter portion of the year. Therefore, the Company\u2019s borrowing needs fluctuates largely based upon its working capital requirements.\nThe Company\u2019s leverage and the effects of seasonal fluctuations in its cash flow, borrowing requirements and ability to borrow could have significant negative consequences on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, including:\n\u2022\nimpairing the Company\u2019s ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenants contained in its debt agreements or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal due under those agreements, which could result in an acceleration of some or all of the Company\u2019s outstanding debt;\n\u2022\nincreasing the Company\u2019s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing;\n\u2022\nincreasing the Company\u2019s borrowing costs if it were to obtain additional debt financing or amend its existing debt agreements;\n\u2022\nrequiring the dedication of a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s cash flow from operations to service the Company\u2019s debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nrequiring the Company to seek debt or equity financing or to sell some of the Company\u2019s core assets, possibly on unfavorable terms, to meet payment obligations;\n\u2022\nlimiting the Company\u2019s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the markets in which the Company competes;\n\u2022\nlimiting the Company\u2019s ability to declare and pay dividends to its stockholders and engage in share repurchase programs; and\n\u2022\nplacing the Company at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors that may have better access to capital resources.\nThe Company\u2019s failure to meet certain covenants or other requirements of its Credit Agreement may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s assets, financial position and cash flows.\nThe Credit Agreement, under certain circumstances, requires the Company to maintain a certain fixed charge coverage ratio. In addition, at any time the Company\u2019s Term Loan is outstanding, the Company\u2019s Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain its Senior Leverage Ratio within defined parameters. As a result of these requirements within the Credit Agreement, the Company is limited in its ability to incur additional debt, make investments or undertake certain other business activities. These requirements could limit the Company\u2019s ability to obtain future financing and may prevent the Company from taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. The Company\u2019s ability to meet the covenants or requirements in its Credit Agreement may be affected by events beyond the Company\u2019s control, and the Company cannot assure you that it will satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or the Company\u2019s inability to comply with the restrictions could result in an event of default under the Credit Agreement, which in turn could result in an event of default under the terms of the Company\u2019s other indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Company\u2019s Credit Agreement, after the expiration of any grace periods, the Company\u2019s lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Company\u2019s debt arrangements, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this happens, the Company cannot assure that its assets would be sufficient to repay in full the payments due under the Credit Agreement or the Company\u2019s other indebtedness.\nThe Company\u2019s borrowings are subject to interest rate fluctuations and an increase in interest rates could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s borrowings bear interest at floating rates. An increase in interest rates would adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate exposure in connection with a portion of its variable interest rate borrowings. To the extent that the Company\u2019s access to credit may be restricted because of its own performance, its bank lenders\u2019 performances or conditions in the capital markets generally, the Company would not be able to operate normally.\nThe Company\u2019s business may be materially adversely affected by market conditions and by global and economic conditions and other factors beyond its control.\nThe Company\u2019s performance is affected by general economic factors, the strength of retail economies and political conditions that are beyond its control. Retail economies are impacted by factors such as consumer demand and the condition of the retail industry, which in turn, are affected by general economic factors. These general economic factors include, among other factors:\n\u2022\nrecession, inflation, deflation, unemployment and other factors adversely affecting consumer spending patterns generally;\n\u2022\nconditions affecting the retail environment for the home and other matters that influence consumer spending in the home retail industry specifically;\n\u2022\nconditions affecting the housing markets;\n\u2022\nconsumer credit availability and consumer debt levels;\n\u2022\nmaterial input costs, including fuel and energy costs and labor cost inflation;\n\u2022\nforeign currency translation;\n\u2022\ninterest rates and the ability to hedge interest rate risks;\n\u2022\ngovernment policies including tax policies relating to value-added taxes, import and export duties and quotas, anti-dumping regulations and related tariffs, import and export controls and social compliance standards;\n\u2022\nthe impact of natural disasters, conflicts and terrorist activities;\n\u2022\nunfavorable economic conditions in the United States, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Asia and elsewhere; and\n\u2022\nunstable economic and political conditions, lack of legal regulation enforcement, civil unrest and political activism, particularly in Asia.\nThe Company faces intense competition from other companies worldwide.\nThe markets for the Company\u2019s products are intensely competitive with the principal competitive factors being product innovation, brand name, product quality, aesthetic appeal to customers, packaging, breadth of product offerings, distribution capability, delivery time and price. Advantages or disadvantages in any of these competitive factors may be sufficient to cause the customer to consider changing providers of the kinds of products that the Company sells. The Company competes with many other suppliers, some of which are larger than the Company, have greater financial and other resources or employ brands that are more established, have greater consumer recognition or are more favorably perceived by consumers or retailers than the Company\u2019s brands. Some competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower profit margins to compete with the Company. As a result of this competition, the Company could lose market share and sales, or be forced to reduce its prices to meet competition. If the Company\u2019s product offerings are unable to compete successfully, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in the Company\u2019s customer purchasing practices could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s wholesale customers include mass merchants, specialty stores, national chains, department stores, warehouse clubs, supermarkets, off-price retailers and Internet retailers. Unanticipated changes in purchasing and other practices by the Company\u2019s customers, including a customer\u2019s pricing and payment terms, inventory destocking,\nlimitations on shelf space, more extensive packaging requirements, changes in order quantities, use of private label brands and other practices, could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, as a result of the desire of retailers to more closely manage inventory levels, there is a growing trend among retailers to make purchases on a \u201cjust-in-time\u201d basis. This requires the Company to shorten its lead time for production in certain cases and more closely anticipate demand, which could in the future require the Company to carry additional inventories. The Company\u2019s annual earnings and cash flows also depend to a great extent on the results of operations in the latter half of the year due to the seasonality of its sales. The Company\u2019s success and sales growth is also dependent on its evaluation of consumer preferences and changing trends.\nMany of the Company\u2019s wholesale customers are significantly larger than the Company, have greater financial and other resources and also purchase goods directly from vendors in Asia and elsewhere. Decisions by large customers to increase their purchases directly from overseas vendors could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. Significant changes or financial difficulties, including consolidations of ownership, restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations or other events that affect retailers, could result in fewer retailers selling the Company\u2019s products, reliance on a smaller group of customers, an increase in the risk of extending credit to these customers or limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to collect amounts due from these customers. Although the Company has long-established relationships with many of its customers, the Company does not have any long-term supply or binding contracts or guarantees of minimum purchases. Purchases by the Company\u2019s customers are generally made using individual purchase orders. Customers may cancel their orders, change purchase quantities from forecast volumes, delay purchases for a number of reasons beyond the Company\u2019s control or change other terms of their business relationship with the Company. Significant or numerous cancellations, reductions, delays in purchases or changes in business practices by customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRetailers place great emphasis on timely delivery of products for specific selling seasons, especially during the third fiscal quarter, and on the fulfillment of consumer demand throughout the year. The Company cannot control all of the various factors that might affect product delivery to retailers. Failure to deliver products to the Company\u2019s retailers in a timely and effective manner, often under special vendor requirements to use specific carriers and delivery schedules, could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and brands and result in a loss of customers or reduced orders.\nChanges at the Company\u2019s large customers, or actions taken by them, and consolidation in the retail industry could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nIn 2015, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., including Sam\u2019s Club and, in the United Kingdom, Asda Superstore (\u201cWalmart\u201d), accounted for 16% of the Company\u2019s consolidated net sales. The Company\u2019s top ten customers accounted for approximately 54% of the Company\u2019s net sales in 2015. A material reduction in purchases by any of such customers could have a significant adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and operating results. In addition, pressures by such customers that would cause the Company to materially reduce the price of the Company\u2019s products could result in reductions of the Company\u2019s operating margin. Any significant changes or financial difficulties that affect these customers, such as reduced sales by such customers (whether for reasons that affect a particular customer or the retail industry in general) may also result in reduced demand for the Company\u2019s products. The Company would also be subject to increased credit risk with respect to such customers. In particular, the concentration of the Company\u2019s business with Walmart extends to its international business, including in China, as well as through Vasconia in Mexico, GSI in Brazil and the Company\u2019s strategic alliance in Canada, due to the market presence of Walmart in these foreign countries. Further, with the continuing trend of consolidation in the retail industry, the ability of the Company\u2019s largest customers to continue to purchase from the Company is always subject to risk. Any changes in purchasing practices or decline in the financial condition, of Walmart or other large customers may have a material adverse impact on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s large customers also have significant purchasing leverage. They may demand lower pricing, special packaging, shorter lead times for the delivery of products or impose other requirements on product suppliers like the Company. These business demands may relate to inventory practices, logistics or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. If the Company does not effectively respond to the demands of its customers, they could decrease or eliminate their purchases from the Company. These risks could be exacerbated if such large customers consolidate, or if the Company\u2019s smaller customers consolidate to become larger customers, which would increase their purchasing leverage. A reduction in the purchases of the Company\u2019s products by its wholesale customers or the costs of complying with customer business demands could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s customers could carry products that directly compete with the Company\u2019s products for retail space and consumer purchases. There is a risk that these customers could give higher priority to products of, or form alliances with, our competitors. Failure of customers to provide the Company\u2019s products with similar levels of promotional support and retail space could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe loss of certain licenses or material changes in royalty rates could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating margin and cash flow.\nSignificant portions of the Company\u2019s business are dependent on trade names, trademarks and patents, some of which are licensed from third parties. In 2015, sales of licensed brands accounted for approximately 42% of the Company\u2019s gross sales. The Company\u2019s licenses for many of these brands require it to pay royalties based on sales. Many of these license agreements are subject to termination by the licensor, if, for example, the Company fails to satisfy certain minimum sales obligations or breaches the terms of the license. The loss of significant licenses or a material increase in the royalty rates the Company pays or other new terms negotiated upon renewal of such licenses could result in a reduction of the Company\u2019s operating margins and cash flow from operations or otherwise adversely affect its business. In particular, the Company\u2019s license to use the KitchenAid brand, which represents a material portion of its sales, is subject to a license agreement that has a three-year term that will expire in December 2018. The Company originally entered into a licensing arrangement for use of the KitchenAid brand in 2000, and has renewed the license, typically for three-year periods, since that time. Although it expects to be able to renew its current KitchenAid license prior to its expiration, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to do so on reasonable terms, or at all, and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company also holds certain rights to use the Farberware brand for kitchen tools and gadgets, cutlery, cutting boards, shears and certain other products which together represent a material portion of its sales, through a fully-paid, royalty-free license for a term that expires in 2195, subject to earlier termination under certain circumstances. The licensor is a joint venture of which the Company is a 50% owner. The other 50% owner of the joint venture has the right to terminate the Company\u2019s license if the Company materially breaches any of the material terms of the license and fails to cure the material breach within 180 days of notice of the breach, if it is determined in an arbitration proceeding that money damages alone would not be sufficient compensation to the licensor and that the breach is so egregious as to warrant termination of the license and forfeiture of the Company\u2019s rights to use the brand under that license agreement. If the Company were to lose the Farberware license for kitchen tools and gadgets, cutlery, cutting boards, shears and other products through termination as a result of an uncured breach, its business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s international operations present special challenges that the Company may not be able to meet, and this could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company conducts business outside of the United States through subsidiaries, affiliates and joint ventures. These entities have operations and assets in the United Kingdom, Mexico, Canada, Brazil, China and Hong Kong. Therefore, the Company is subject to increases and decreases in its investments in these entities resulting from the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These entities also bear risks similar to those risks faced by the Company. However, there are specific additional risks related to these organizations, such as the failure of the Company\u2019s partners or other investors to meet their obligations and higher credit and liquidity risks related to thinly capitalized entities. Failure of these entities or the Company\u2019s vendors to adhere to required regulatory or other standards, including social compliance standards, could materially and adversely impact the Company\u2019s reputation and business.\nIn addition, the Company sells its products in foreign countries and seeks to increase its level of international business activity. Accordingly, the Company is subject to various risks, including:\n\u2022\nU.S.-imposed embargoes of sales to specific countries;\n\u2022\nforeign import controls (which may be arbitrarily imposed or enforced);\n\u2022\nimport regulations and duties;\n\u2022\nexport regulations (which require the Company to comply with stringent licensing regimes);\n\u2022\nanti-dumping regulations;\n\u2022\nprice and currency controls;\n\u2022\nexchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\ndividend remittance restrictions;\n\u2022\nexpropriation of assets;\n\u2022\nwar, civil uprisings and riots;\n\u2022\ngovernment instability;\n\u2022\nthe necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations;\n\u2022\nlegal systems or decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied;\n\u2022\nunanticipated income taxes, excise duties, import taxes, export taxes or other governmental assessments; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing a global enterprise.\nAny significant violations of these regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions or the loss of export or other licenses, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the Company\u2019s organizational structure may limit its ability to transfer funds between countries, particularly into and out of the United States, without incurring adverse tax consequences. Any of these events could result in a loss of business or other unexpected costs that could reduce sales or profits and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nInternational suppliers subject the Company to regional regulatory, political, economic and foreign currency exchange risk that could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company sources its products from suppliers located principally in Asia, Europe and the United States. The Company\u2019s vendors in Asia, from whom a substantial majority of the Company\u2019s products are sourced, are located primarily in the People\u2019s Republic of China, which subjects the Company to various risks within the region including regulatory, political, economic and foreign currency changes. The Company\u2019s ability to select and retain reliable vendors and suppliers who provide timely deliveries of quality parts and products efficiently will impact its success in meeting customer demand for timely delivery of quality products. The Company\u2019s sourcing operations and its vendors are impacted by labor costs in China, where labor historically has been readily available at low cost relative to labor costs in North America. However, as China is experiencing rapid social, political and economic changes, labor costs have risen in some regions and labor in China may not continue to be available to the Company at costs consistent with historical levels. Changes in labor or other laws may be enacted which would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations in China, or those of the Company\u2019s suppliers. Although China currently enjoys \u201cmost favored nation\u201d trading status with the U.S., the U.S. government has in the past proposed to revoke such status and to impose higher tariffs on products imported from China. Changes in currency exchange rates might negatively affect the Company and its overseas vendors\u2019 profitability and business prospects. The Company does not have access to its vendors\u2019 financial information and the Company is unable to assess its vendors\u2019 financial condition, including their liquidity. Interruption of supplies from any of the Company\u2019s vendors, or the loss of one or more key vendors, could have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s business and operating results.\nForeign exchange variability could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company\u2019s functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. Changes in the relation of foreign currencies to the U.S. Dollar will affect the Company\u2019s sales and profitability and can result in exchange losses because the Company has operations and assets located outside the United States. The Company transacts a portion of its business in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily British Pounds, and to a lesser degree, Chinese Renminbi, Euros and Canadian Dollars. Such transactions include sales, certain inventory purchases and operating expenses. As a result, portions of the Company\u2019s cash, trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable are denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, foreign operations expose the Company to foreign currency fluctuations, both for purposes of actual conversion and financial reporting purposes. In our consolidated financial statements, we translate local currency financial results into U.S. dollars based on the exchange rates prevailing during the reporting periods. During times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, the reported revenues and earnings of our international operations will be reduced because the local currencies will translate into fewer U.S. dollars.\nThe Company\u2019s strategic alliances in Mexico, Canada and Brazil also subject the Company to increases and decreases in its investments resulting from the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe vast majority of products are purchased from China in U.S. Dollars, including products purchased by the Company\u2019s international operations. As a result, the gross margin from international operations is subject to volatility from movements in exchange rates, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and profitability from the growth desired from international operations. The Company has entered into foreign exchange derivative financial instruments to hedge the volatility of exchange rates related to a portion of its international inventory purchases. The Company cannot ensure, however, that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency rate movements. If the Chinese Renminbi should appreciate against the U.S. Dollar, the costs of the Company\u2019s products will likely rise over time because of the impact the fluctuations will have on the Company\u2019s suppliers, and the Company may not be able to pass on these price increases to its customers. The Company is also subject to the risks of currency controls and devaluations. Currency controls may limit the Company\u2019s ability to convert currencies into U.S. Dollars or other currencies, as needed, or to pay dividends or make other payments from funds held by subsidiaries in the countries imposing such controls, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s liquidity.\nAs the Company continues to expand its international operations, it will be subject to increased foreign exchange variability which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. The impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on the Company\u2019s results of operations cannot be accurately predicted.\nThe Company\u2019s international trade subjects it to transportation risks.\nThe Company imports its products for delivery to its distribution centers, as well as arranges for its customers to import goods to which title has passed overseas or at port of entry. For purchases that are to be delivered to its distribution centers, the Company arranges for transportation, primarily by sea, from ports in Asia and Europe to ports in the United States, principally New York/Newark/Elizabeth and Los Angeles/Long Beach, and in the United Kingdom, principally Felixstowe. Accordingly, the Company is subject to risks incidental to such transportation. These risks include, but are not limited to, increases in fuel costs, fuel shortages, the availability of ships, increased security restrictions, work stoppages, weather disruptions and carriers\u2019 ability to provide delivery services to meet the Company\u2019s shipping needs. Transportation disruptions and increased transportation costs could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company delivers its products to its customers or makes such products available for customer pickup from its distribution centers. During the third and fourth quarter of 2014, the Company\u2019s distribution process was impacted by the longshoremen\u2019s work slowdown and the threat of a strike on the west coast. The impact of slowdowns and labor strikes on the Company\u2019s operations, prolonged domestic transportation disruptions, as well as workforce or systems issues related to the Company\u2019s distribution centers, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to deliver goods to its customers.\nThe Company may not be able to adequately establish or protect its intellectual property rights, and the infringement or loss of the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights could harm its business.\nTo establish and protect the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights, the Company relies upon a combination of U.S., foreign and multi-national patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, together with licenses, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements. The measures that the Company takes to protect its intellectual property rights may prove inadequate to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating the Company\u2019s intellectual property, or from breaching their contractual obligations to the Company.\nThe Company has obtained and applied for numerous U.S. and foreign trademark, service mark and patent registrations, and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional marks, patents or other intellectual property, as appropriate. The Company cannot guarantee that any of its pending applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. Moreover, even if such applications are approved, third parties may seek to oppose, declare invalid or otherwise challenge these registrations. Failure to obtain registrations for the Company\u2019s intellectual property in the United States and other countries could limit the Company\u2019s ability to protect its intellectual property rights and impede the Company\u2019s marketing efforts and operations in those jurisdictions.\nThe Company may need to resort to litigation to enforce or defend its intellectual property rights. If a competitor or collaborator files a patent application claiming technology also claimed by the Company, or a trademark application claiming a trademark, service mark or trade dress also used by the Company, in order to protect the Company\u2019s rights, the Company may have to participate in opposition or interference proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or a similar foreign agency. The Company cannot guarantee that the operation of its business does not infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of third parties, and the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights may be challenged by third parties or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. The costs associated with protecting intellectual property rights, including litigation costs associated with litigation or administrative proceedings, may be material and there can be no assurance that any such litigation or administrative proceedings will be successful. Any such matters or proceedings could be burdensome, divert the time and resources of the Company\u2019s personnel and the Company may not prevail. Furthermore, even if the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights are not directly challenged, disputes among third parties could lead to the weakening or invalidation of the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights, or other parties such as the Company\u2019s competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the Company\u2019s technology.\nThe laws of certain foreign countries in which the Company operates or may operate in the future do not protect, and the governments of certain foreign countries do not enforce, intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws and government of the U.S., which may negate the Company\u2019s competitive or technological advantages in such markets. Moreover, any repeal or weakening of intellectual property laws or enforcement of those laws in the United States or foreign jurisdictions could make it more difficult for the Company to adequately protect its intellectual property rights, negatively impacting their value and increasing the cost of enforcing the Company\u2019s rights. If the Company is unable to establish or adequately protect its intellectual property rights, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf the Company is unable to protect the confidentiality of its proprietary information and know-how, the value of the Company\u2019s technology, products and services could be harmed significantly.\nIn addition to registered intellectual property, the Company relies on know-how and other proprietary information in operating its business. If this information is not adequately protected, then it may be disclosed or used in an unauthorized manner. To the extent that consultants, vendors, key employees or other third parties apply technology independently developed by them or by others to the Company\u2019s proposed products in the absence of a valid license or suitable non-disclosure or assignment of inventions provisions, disputes may arise as to the ownership of or rights to use such technology, which may not be resolved in the Company\u2019s favor. The risk that other parties may breach confidentiality or other agreements could harm the Company by enabling the Company\u2019s competitors and other entities, who may have greater experience and financial resources, to copy or use the Company\u2019s proprietary information in the advancement of their products, methods or technologies.\nThe Company sells consumer products which involve an inherent risk of product liability claims.\nThe marketing of certain of the Company\u2019s consumer products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims or recalls or other regulatory or enforcement actions initiated by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, by the Office of Fair Trading in the U.K., by other regulatory authorities or through private causes of action and the Company has had in the past, and may have in the future, recalls (both voluntary and involuntary) of its products. Any defects in products the Company markets could harm the Company\u2019s reputation, adversely affect its relationship with its customers and decrease market acceptance of the Company\u2019s products and the strength of the brand names under which the Company markets such products. Potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of the Company\u2019s insurance coverage and could materially damage the Company\u2019s business and its financial condition. Additionally, the Company\u2019s product standards could be impacted by new or revised environmental rules and regulations or other social initiatives.\nThe Company operates in a regulated environment that imposes significant compliance requirements. Non-compliance with these requirements could subject the Company to sanctions and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company is subject in the ordinary course of its business, in the United States and elsewhere, to many statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations that, if violated by the Company or its affiliates, partners or vendors, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. The Company is required to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-kickback laws adopted in many of the countries in which the Company does business which prohibit the Company from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and also require maintenance of adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately reflect transactions. Under the FCPA, companies operating in the United States may be held liable for actions taken by their strategic or local partners or representatives. The U.K. Bribery Act is broader in scope than the FCPA in that it directly addresses commercial bribery in addition to bribery of government officials and it does not recognize certain exceptions, notably facilitation payments that are permitted by the FCPA. Civil and criminal penalties may be imposed for violations of these laws. In many of the countries in which the Company operates, particularly those with developing economies, it is or has been common for government officials and businesses to engage in business practices that are prohibited by these laws. If the Company does not properly implement and maintain practices and controls with respect to compliance with applicable anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws, or if the Company fails to enforce those practices and controls properly, the Company may be subject to regulatory sanctions, including administrative costs related to governmental and internal investigations, civil and criminal penalties, injunctions and restrictions on the Company\u2019s business and capital raising activities, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The Company\u2019s employees, distributors, dealers and other agents could engage in conduct that is not in compliance with such laws for which the Company might be held responsible. If the Company\u2019s employees, distributors, dealers or other agents are found to have engaged in illegal practices, the Company could suffer substantial penalties and the reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition of the Company could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company is additionally subject to general business laws and regulations, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and e-commerce. Such existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of Internet or other online services and thereby adversely impact the Company\u2019s sales. These laws and regulations may cover taxation, user privacy, data security, pricing, content, proprietary rights, advertising, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, the provision of online payment services, broadband residential Internet access and the characteristics and quality of products and services. It is not clear in certain cases how existing laws and regulations governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes and personal privacy apply to the Internet and e-commerce. Unfavorable resolutions of these issues would harm the Company\u2019s business, diminish the demand for the Company\u2019s products on the Internet and increase the Company\u2019s cost of doing business.\nDemand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new competitive products at favorable profit margins could adversely affect the Company\u2019s performance and prospects for future growth.\nNew product introductions and product innovation are significant contributors to the Company\u2019s growth strategy and the Company\u2019s long-term success in the competitive retail environment depends in part on the Company\u2019s ability to develop and market a continuing stream of innovative new products that meet changing consumer preferences. The uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products, such as the market demands and the costs of development and production may impede the successful development and introduction of new products. Acceptance of the new products may\nnot meet sales expectations due to several factors, such as the Company\u2019s failure to accurately predict market demand or its inability to resolve technical issues in a timely and cost-effective manner. Additionally, the inability to develop new products on a timely basis could result in the loss of business to competitors.\nThe Company\u2019s brands are subject to reputational risks.\nThe Company\u2019s brands and its reputation are among its most important assets. The Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain customers depends, in part, upon the external perceptions of the Company, the quality of its products and its corporate and management integrity. The consumer goods industry is by its nature more prone to reputational risks than other industries. This has been compounded in recent years by the free flow of unverified information on the Internet and, in particular, on social media. Damage to the Company\u2019s brands or reputation or negative publicity or perceptions about the Company could adversely affect its business.\nThe Company depends on third-party manufactures to produce the majority of its products which presents quality control risks to the Company.\nWith the exception of the Company\u2019s sterling silver products, the Company sources almost all of its products from suppliers located outside the United States, primarily in the People\u2019s Republic of China, which restricts the Company\u2019s ability to monitor and control their manufacture of the Company\u2019s goods.\nAlthough the Company has agreements with its third party manufacturers regarding quality standards and regularly audits the facilities of its manufacturers, through its quality control program, there can be no assurance that the third party manufacturers will continue to meet the Company\u2019s quality standards, social standards regarding its workforce that is expected in the United States or legislation and regulations that apply to the products the Company contracts to manufacture. Failure by the Company\u2019s manufacturers to meet these standards could, in turn, increase order cancellations, returns, price concessions and decrease customer demand for our products. Non-compliance with the Company\u2019s product standards, regulatory requirements or product recall (or other regulatory actions) could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nA failure in the Company\u2019s operating systems or infrastructure or those of third parties could disrupt the Company\u2019s business and cause losses.\nThe Company relies on many information technology systems for the operation of its principal business functions, including the Company\u2019s enterprise resource planning, warehouse management, inventory forecast and re-ordering and call center systems. In the case of the Company\u2019s inventory forecast and re-ordering system, most of the Company\u2019s orders are received directly through electronic connections with the Company\u2019s largest customers. Additionally, the success of certain product categories in a competitive marketplace is dependent upon the creation and launch of new, innovative products. Accordingly, to keep pace within a competitive retail environment, the Company uses and will continue to evaluate new technologies to improve the efficiency of designing new innovative products. The failure of any of these systems or technologies could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to cyber security risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.\nThe Company employs information technology systems and Internet systems, including websites, which allow for the secure storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding the Company\u2019s customers, employees and others, including credit card information and personal identification information. The Company has made significant efforts to secure its computer network to mitigate the risk of possible cyber-attacks. However, the regulatory environment governing information, security and privacy laws, as well as the requirements imposed on the Company by the credit card industry, is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. The security of the Company\u2019s computer networks could be compromised which could impact operations and confidential information could be misappropriated, which could lead to negative publicity, loss of sales and profits or cause the Company to incur significant costs to reimburse third-parties for damages which could adversely impact profits. Furthermore, maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations and standards may increase the Company\u2019s operating costs and/or adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to market its products or process payment information.\nThe Company\u2019s senior executives and other key management are critical to the Company\u2019s success. The loss of, and failure to attract and maintain its highly skilled personnel could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends, in part, on the efforts and skills of the executive officers of the Company. The Company\u2019s executive officers are experienced and highly qualified in the housewares industry. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key management personnel could harm our business and our ability to timely achieve our strategic initiatives. The Company\u2019s success also depends, in part, on its ability to identify, hire and retain other skilled personnel. The Company\u2019s industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting among competitors for personnel with successful track records. The Company may not be able to attract and retain skilled personnel or may incur significant costs in order to do so.\nIncreases in the cost of employee benefits could materially adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial results and cash flows.\nThe Company self-insures a substantial portion of the costs of employee healthcare and workers compensation. This could result in higher volatility in the Company\u2019s earnings and exposes the Company to higher financial risks. The Company\u2019s medical costs in recent years have generally increased and an aging workforce and other employee demographics could result in an increase in our medical costs beyond what we have experienced or expect. We have stop-loss coverage in place for catastrophic events, but the aggregate impact of a high number of claims up to our stop-loss limit may have an effect on our profitability.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as the Affordable Care Act, which came into effect in 2013, contains provisions which could materially adversely impact the Company\u2019s future healthcare costs. Changes in the law, including the imposition of a penalty on individuals who do not obtain healthcare coverage, may result in employees who are currently eligible but elect not to participate in the Company\u2019s healthcare plans now finding it more advantageous to do so, which may increase the Company\u2019s healthcare costs. The requirements of the Affordable Care Act is also likely to impose some additional administrative costs on the Company. It is also possible that making changes or failing to make changes in the healthcare plans the Company offers will make the Company less attractive to its current or potential employees.\nThe Company\u2019s product costs are subject to price fluctuation.\nVarious commodities comprise the raw materials used to manufacture the Company\u2019s products. The prices of these commodities have historically fluctuated on a cyclical basis and have often depended on a variety of factors over which the Company has no control. Additionally, labor costs represent a significant component of the Company\u2019s supplier\u2019s manufacturing costs and the Company\u2019s suppliers may increase the prices they charge the Company if they experience rising labor costs. The cost of producing and distributing the Company\u2019s products is also sensitive to energy costs, duties and tariffs. The selling prices of the Company\u2019s products have not always increased in response to raw material, labor or other cost increases, and the Company is unable to determine to what extent, if any, it will be able to pass future cost increases through to its customers. The Company\u2019s inability to come to favorable agreements with its suppliers or to pass increased costs through to the Company\u2019s customers could materially and adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business is highly seasonal.\nThe Company\u2019s business and working capital needs are highly seasonal, with a majority of sales occurring in the third and fourth quarters. In 2015, net sales for the third and fourth quarters accounted for 59% of total annual net sales. If the Company has poor operating results during the third and fourth quarters it would have a disproportionately adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition or results of operations. In addition, with a significant amount of its revenue being realized during the latter portion of the year, the Company\u2019s working capital and borrowing needs fluctuate, which could result in higher borrowings and lower availability under the Credit Agreement during these quarters.\nIf the Company\u2019s goodwill or other long-term assets become impaired, the Company will be required to record impairment charges, which may be significant.\nA portion of the Company\u2019s long-term assets consists of goodwill recorded as a result of the Company\u2019s acquisitions; other identifiable intangible assets, including trade names; and fixed assets. At December 31, 2015, goodwill totaled $18.1 million. The Company does not amortize goodwill but rather reviews it for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its current fair value as determined based on the discounted future cash flows of the reporting unit or market comparable sales and earnings multiples, the goodwill or intangible asset is considered impaired and is reduced to fair value. Events and conditions that could result in impairment include a prolonged period of global economic weakness, a further decline in economic conditions or a slow, weak economic recovery, as well as sustained declines in the price of the Company\u2019s common stock, adverse changes in the regulatory environment, adverse changes in the market share of our products, adverse changes in interest rates, or other factors leading to reductions in the long-term sales or profitability that we expect. Determination of the fair value of a reporting unit includes developing estimates which are highly subjective and incorporate calculations that are sensitive to minor changes in underlying assumptions. Management\u2019s assumptions change as more information becomes available. Changes in these assumptions could result in an impairment charge in the future, which could have a significant adverse impact on our reported earnings. If future operating performance of one or more of the Company\u2019s operating segments does not meet expectations, the Company may be required to record a significant charge during the period in which any impairment of the Company\u2019s goodwill or other long-term assets is determined.\nAs of October 1, 2015, the Company\u2019s annual impairment testing date, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was calculated by the discounted cash flow method and the resultant estimated fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded their carrying value and no goodwill impairment charges were recorded. For one of the reporting units tested, the Kitchen Craft reporting unit, which carried goodwill of $13.0 million, the excess of fair value over its carrying value was 5%. This reporting unit was acquired in 2014, and therefore the Company did not expect the fair value to be significantly in excess of the carrying value. There were no fundamental changes in the business that would indicate a significant decline in the fair value since the acquisition date, however macroeconomic conditions in Europe have contributed to a decline in operating profit. Management\u2019s projections used to estimate the undiscounted cash flows included increasing net sales and operational improvements designed to reduce costs. Changes in any of the significant assumptions used can materially affect the expected cash flows, and such impacts can potentially result in a material non-cash impairment charge.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $3.4 million to reduce the book value of Elements and Melannco, home decor trade names. In addition, during 2014, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $6.0 million related to its investment in GSI. The recognition of an impairment of the Company\u2019s goodwill or any of the Company\u2019s assets would negatively affect the results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material.\nInterruptions in the Company\u2019s operations caused by outside forces could cause material losses.\nThe Company\u2019s worldwide operations could be subject to natural and man-made disasters, telecommunications failures, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, conflicts, acts of terrorism, health epidemics and other business interruptions. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm the Company\u2019s business, revenue and financial condition and increase the Company\u2019s costs and expenses. If the Company\u2019s or its manufacturers\u2019 warehousing facilities or transportation facilities are damaged or destroyed, the Company would be unable to distribute products on a timely basis, which could harm the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s back-up operations may be inadequate, and the Company\u2019s business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate for any losses that may occur.\nThe Company\u2019s projections of product demand, sales and net income are highly subjective in nature and the Company\u2019s future sales and net income could vary in a material amount from the Company\u2019s projections.\nFrom time to time, the Company may provide projections to its stockholders, lenders, the investment community, and other stakeholders of the Company\u2019s future sales and net income. Since the Company does not have long-term purchase commitments from customers and the customer order and shipment process is very short, it is difficult for the Company to\naccurately predict the demand for many of its products, or the amount and timing of the Company\u2019s future sales and related net income. The Company\u2019s projections are based on management\u2019s best estimate of sales using historical sales data and other information deemed relevant. These projections are highly subjective since sales can fluctuate substantially based on the demands of retail customers and due to other risks described in this Annual Report. Additionally, changes in retailer inventory management strategies could make the Company\u2019s inventory management more difficult. Because the Company\u2019s ability to forecast product demand and the timing of related sales includes significant subjective input, future sales and net income could vary materially from the Company\u2019s projections.\nThe Company\u2019s business requires it to maintain a large fixed-cost base that can affect its profitability. Cost reduction efforts and restructurings benefits may not be realized.\nThe Company\u2019s business requires it to maintain large distribution facilities in its key markets, which represent high fixed rental costs relating to its leased facilities. In addition, significant portions of the Company\u2019s selling, general and administrative expenses, including leased showrooms, are fixed, they neither increase nor decrease proportionally with sales. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s gross margins depend, in part, on its ability to spread certain other costs, of which a significant portion are fixed, over its products sold. Decreased demand or the need to reduce inventories can lower the Company\u2019s ability to absorb fixed costs and adversely affect its results of operations. This is exacerbated by the high degree of seasonality impacting the Company, which results in lower demand during the first two quarters of the year, while many of the operating costs remain fixed, which further affects profitability.\nIn order to operate more efficiently and control costs, the Company may announce from time to time restructuring plans, including workforce reductions, global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives that are intended to generate operating expense savings. The implementation of restructuring plans could be disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations, result in higher than anticipated charges and otherwise adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the Company\u2019s ability to complete the restructuring plan and achieve the anticipated benefits from the plan is subject to estimates and assumptions and may vary materially from the Company\u2019s expectations, including as a result of factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control. Furthermore, following completion of a restructuring plan, the business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan.\nThe Company may not be able to adequately address the additional review and disclosure required in respect of \u201cConflict Minerals.\u201d\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains regulations concerning the supply of conflict minerals originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. As a result, the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies that use such conflict minerals in the products they manufacture or contract to manufacture. These requirements require ongoing due diligence efforts and there are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including the costs of investigations to determine the sources of raw materials used in the Company\u2019s products and the costs of any changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of the results of such investigations. These rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company\u2019s products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering these conflict minerals from \u201cconflict free\u201d sources, the Company cannot ensure that it will be able to obtain necessary materials from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, the Company may face reputational challenges if it determines that certain of its products contain conflict minerals not determined to be \u201cconflict free\u201d or if it is unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in its products through the procedures the Company has implemented and may implement in the future.\nThe Company may incur material costs due to environmental liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to a broad range of federal, state, local, foreign and multi-national laws and regulations relating to the environment. These include laws and regulations that govern:\n\u2022\ndischarges to the air, water and land;\n\u2022\nthe handling and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes; and\n\u2022\nremediation of contamination associated with release of hazardous substances at the Company\u2019s facilities and at off-site disposal locations.\nThe Company may incur material costs to comply with increasingly stringent environmental laws and enforcement policies. Moreover, there are proposed international accords and treaties, as well as federal, state and local laws and regulations, which would attempt to control or limit the causes of climate change, including the effect of greenhouse gas emissions on the environment. In the event that the U.S. government or foreign governments enact new climate change laws or regulations or make changes to existing laws or regulations, compliance with applicable laws or regulations may result in increased manufacturing costs for the Company\u2019s products, such as by requiring investment in new pollution control equipment or changing the ways in which certain of the Company\u2019s products are made. The Company may incur some of these costs directly and others may be passed on to the Company from its third-party suppliers. Although the Company believes that it is substantially in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations at its facilities, the Company may not always be in compliance with such laws and regulations or any new laws and regulations in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWallace Silversmiths de Puerto Rico, Ltd. (\u201cWSPR\u201d), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, operates a manufacturing facility in San Germ\u00e1n, Puerto Rico that is leased from the Puerto Rico Industrial Development Company (\u201cPRIDCO\u201d). In March 2008, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the \u201cEPA\u201d) announced that the San Germ\u00e1n Ground Water Contamination site in Puerto Rico (the \u201cSite\u201d) had been added to the Superfund National Priorities List due to contamination present in the local drinking water supply.\nIn May 2008, WSPR received from the EPA a Notice of Potential Liability and Request for Information Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sections 9607(a) and 9604(e) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d). WSPR has cooperated with the EPA in their investigation. In August 2015, the EPA released its remedial investigation and feasibility study (\u201cRI/FS\u201d) for the Site. In December 2015, the EPA issued its Record of Decision (\u201cROD\u201d) for OU-1, selecting a dual phase removal remedy to deal with soil contamination. The EPA\u2019s selected remedy consists of soil vapor extraction and dual-phase extraction/in-situ treatment. It is not possible at this time for the Company to estimate its share of liability, if any, related to this matter. However, in the event of one or more adverse determinations related to this matter, it is possible that the ultimate liability resulting from this matter and the impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations could be material.\nIf previously unknown contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of the Company\u2019s manufacturing facility or other properties that are currently or have formerly been owned, operated or used by the Company is discovered, the Company could be required to incur material unforeseen expenses. If this occurs, it may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to complete future acquisitions or strategic alliances and/or integrate acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Company has achieved growth through acquisitions, investments and joint ventures. The Company has completed approximately 15 acquisitions and strategic investments since 2006, including four acquisitions completed in the first quarter of 2014. The Company seeks acquisition opportunities that complement and expand its operations, some of which are based outside the United States. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms, obtain regulatory approval or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future.\nAdditionally, the Company may not be able to successfully integrate these businesses or future acquisitions into its existing business without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial difficulties. The Company could face significant challenges in consolidating functions and integrating procedures and processes, internal controls, information technology and other systems, personnel, product lines and operations in a timely and efficient manner.\nThere are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s controls.\nThe Company does not expect that its disclosure controls or the Company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only\nreasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. If the Company\u2019s controls become inadequate, it could fail to meet its financial reporting obligations, its reputation may be adversely affected, its business and operating results could be harmed, and the market price of its stock could decline.", "PERMNO": 76686, "SIC": 3420, "TIC": "LCUT"}
