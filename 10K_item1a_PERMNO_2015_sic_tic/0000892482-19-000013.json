{"cik": "892482", "company": "Qumu Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-15", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our results of operations, cash flows and the market price of our common stock could be negatively impacted. Although we believe that we have identified and discussed below the most significant risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our performance or financial condition. Any forecast regarding our future performance, including, but not limited to, forecasts regarding estimated bookings, revenue, or cash flow from our operating activities, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements reflect various assumptions and are subject to significant uncertainties and risks that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statement, including the risks reflected in the risk factors set forth below. Consequently, the future results expressed or implied by any forward-looking statement are not guaranteed and the variation of actual results or events from such statements may be material and adverse.\nThe markets for video content and software to manage video content are each in early stages of development. If this market does not develop or develops more slowly than we expect, our revenues may decline or fail to grow.\nThe use of video as a mainstream communication and collaboration platform and the market for video content management software is in an early stage of development, and it is uncertain whether this use of video will achieve high levels of acceptance. Widespread acceptance and use of video in the enterprise is critical to our future growth and success. Likewise, it is uncertain whether video content management software will achieve high levels of demand and market acceptance. Our success will depend on enterprises adopting video as a platform and upon enterprise demand for software to help them capture, organize and distribute this content.\nSome customers may be reluctant or unwilling to use video as a medium within the enterprise for a number of reasons, including lack of perceived benefit of this new method of communication and existing investments in other enterprise-wide communications tools. Further, even if customers are using video as a medium, these customers may choose to rely upon their own IT infrastructure and resources to manage their video content. Because many companies generally are predisposed to maintaining control of their IT systems and infrastructure, there may be resistance to using software as a service provided by a third party. Privacy concerns and transition costs are also factors that may affect a potential customer\u2019s decision to subscribe to an external solution.\nAdditional factors that may limit market acceptance of our video content management software include:\n\u2022\ncompetitive dynamics may cause pricing levels to change as the market matures and cause customers to seek out lower priced alternatives to our video content management software or force us to reduce the prices we charge for our products or services; or\n\u2022\nexisting and new market participants may introduce new types of solutions and different approaches to enable enterprises to address their enterprise communications or video communications needs and these disruptive technologies may reduce demand for our video content management software.\nIf customers do not perceive the benefits of our video content management software, or if customers are unwilling to accept video content as an alternative to other more traditional forms of enterprise communication, the market for our software might not continue to develop or might develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would significantly adversely affect our financial results and prospects.\nIf we are unable to attract new customers, retain existing customers and sell additional products and services to our existing and new customers, our revenue growth and profitability will be adversely affected and we may violate our covenants under the ESW Holdings credit agreement.\nTo increase our revenues and achieve profitability, we must regularly add new customers, retain our existing customers, ensure high rates of renewals among our existing customers, and sell additional products and services to new and existing customers.\nWe intend to grow our business by developing and improving our product offerings, ensuring high levels of customer satisfaction, competing effectively with products and services offered by others, retaining and attracting talent, developing relationships with channel partners and increasing our marketing activities.\nIf we fail to add new customers or lose existing customers or if our existing customers do not renew their subscriptions at the same levels or do not increase their purchases of products and services, we will not grow our revenue as expected and our operating results will suffer. Additionally, our January 12, 2018 credit agreement with ESW Holdings contains covenants relating to minimum core bookings, maximum non-current deferred revenue, minimum subscription, and maintenance and support revenue, and minimum subscription and maintenance and support dollar renewal rates. Our failure to attract new customers, retain existing customers, and expand our sales to new and existing customers may lead to challenges in complying with these credit agreement covenants.\nWe are projecting compliance with the covenants for the remainder of the term of the loan, which matures on January 10, 2020. However, if an event of default occurs due to the Company not maintaining compliance with these covenants, ESW Holdings may accelerate the repayment of outstanding obligations, which could negatively impact our ability to fund our working capital requirements, capital expenditures and general corporate expenses.\nWe will need additional capital to fund repayment of our $4 million term loan due in January 2020 and any additional capital we seek may not be available in the amount or at the time we need it.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2018, we had an operating loss of $6.9 million, used $2.8 million of net cash in continuing operating activities, and ended 2018 with $8.6 million in cash and cash equivalents.\nOn January 12, 2018, we replaced our prior $8.0 million term loan with a new $10.0 million term loan credit agreement with ESW Holdings, Inc. Interest on the term loan accrues and compounds monthly at a variable rate per annum equal to the prime rate plus 4%. On July 19, 2018, we paid $6.5 million of outstanding debt under our credit agreement with ESW Holdings, consisting of principal of $6.0 million and accrued interest of $463,000. At December 31, 2018, we had approximately $4.0 million in outstanding debt under the ESW Holdings term loan credit agreement. Under the ESW Holdings term loan credit agreement interest accrued at 9.50% and accrued and unpaid interest was $172,000 as of December 31, 2018. The term loan is scheduled to mature on January 10, 2020, at which time all outstanding principal and then accrued interest will be due and payable in full. At maturity, assuming no earlier repayment of the term loan, the total amount of principal and interest due will be approximately $4.6 million.\nOver the last several years including 2016 and into 2019, we have implemented an ongoing expense reduction program that, when combined with expected revenue performance in 2019, we believe will allow us to attain our goal of becoming cash flow breakeven in the third quarter of 2019.\nWhile we expect that our cash balance at the time of maturity of the ESW Holdings obligation will be sufficient to fund repayment, the use of our then existing cash for this short-term purpose would require us to obtain additional capital to execute our business plan and pursue our growth objectives in the long-term. Accordingly, to fund this short-term capital need, we will need to secure additional capital to repay the term loan at maturity.\nWe may obtain capital to repay, or to combine with our cash to repay, the term loan with ESW Holdings by incurring indebtedness, from an offering or sales of our equity securities or a combination of any of these. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be available in the amount or at the time we need it, or that it will be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur expected financing needs to repay the ESW Holdings debt are based upon management estimates as to future revenue, cash flows and expense. Our business plan and financing needs are subject to change based upon, among other factors, our ability to generate revenue and our ability to effectively manage costs. If our estimates of our financing needs change, we may need additional capital more quickly than we expect or we may need a greater amount of capital.\nIf we cannot timely raise the funds needed to repay the full amount due to ESW Holdings in January 2020, we may be forced to make further substantial reductions in our operating expenses in order to ensure we have sufficient cash to repay ESW Holdings and to continue our business thereafter. Any such substantial reductions in our operating expenses could limit our sales and marketing efforts, adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, limit our ability to develop and enhance our solutions, make it more difficult for us to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements, and otherwise adversely affect our ability to pursue our growth objectives.\nIf we fail to repay the ESW Holdings obligations when due, ESW Holdings may exercise its rights and remedies as a secured lender pursuant to the credit agreement and related agreements we have entered into giving ESW Holdings a security interest in substantially all of our properties, rights and assets (including equity interests of our subsidiaries).\nAdditionally, if we are not able to become cash flow breakeven in the third quarter of 2019 by increasing revenue and controlling expenses, we may need to raise capital in the future to execute our business plan and pursue our growth objectives. We believe the key factors to funding our long-term capital needs will be our ability to increase revenue and bookings and generate significant positive cash flow from our operations. Because of the mandatory prepayment provisions of our credit agreement with ESW Holdings, we will be required to repay the term loan in full before we would be able to use any of the net proceeds from the issuances of equity or debt securities or other loan proceeds to fund any long-term capital needs.\nIf we raise additional equity financing, our shareholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the value of shares of our common stock could decline. Our efforts to raise additional funds from the sale of equity may be hampered by the currently depressed trading price of our common stock and low trading volumes. New investors may demand rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock. Any additional debt we incur would likely have covenants that would affect the manner in which we conduct our business, including by restricting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, preventing us from creating liens or requiring specified financial covenants. In addition, we may face challenges in securing additional debt financing if our future cash flow from operations is not sufficient to support debt service payments.\nWe have a history of losses and while our goal is to become cash flow breakeven in the third quarter of 2019, we may not achieve that goal or achieve or sustain cash flows or profitability in the future.\nWe experienced consolidated net losses of $3.6 million, $11.7 million and $11.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Moreover, we have historically not generated sufficient operating cash flow to fund our\noperations and expect to incur additional operating losses through at least the first half of 2019. Over the last several years including 2016 and into 2019, we have implemented an ongoing expense reduction program that, when combined with expected revenue performance in 2019, we believe will allow us to attain our goal of becoming cash flow breakeven in the third quarter of 2019.\nIn order to achieve our goal of becoming cash flow breakeven and to achieve cash flow positivity and profitability in the future, we must increase the revenues received from the sale of our enterprise video content management software solutions, hardware, maintenance and support, and professional and other services, as well as achieve and maintain an expense structure that is aligned with our forecasted revenue and cash flows. Our ability to increase revenues depends upon increasing the number of new customers and expanding our sales to existing customers, maintaining high renewal rates among our existing customers, and maintaining our prices (despite pricing pressure due to competition).\nWe cannot assure you that we will achieve our goal of becoming cash flow breakeven in the third quarter of 2019, particularly if the benefits we expect to realize from some of our recent expense reduction efforts do not materialize in the timeframes or the amount of reduction to expenses that we have planned. We cannot assure you that we will generate increases in our revenues, attain a level of profitable operations, or successfully implement our business plan or future business opportunities. Our business plan and financing needs are subject to change depending on, among other things, success of our efforts to grow revenue and our efforts to continue to effectively manage expenses. If we are ultimately unable to generate sufficient revenue to meet our financial targets, become profitable and have sustainable positive cash flows, we may be required to further reduce expenses, which could have a further negative effect on our ability to generate revenue, or we may be required to raise additional capital more quickly than we expect or we may need more capital than we expect.\nWe encounter long sales cycles with our enterprise video solutions, which could adversely affect our operating results in a given period.\nOur ability to increase revenues and achieve profitability depends, in large part, on widespread acceptance of our enterprise video content management software products by large businesses and other organizations. As we target our sales efforts at these customers, we face greater costs, longer sales cycles and less predictability in completing sales. In the large enterprise market, the customer\u2019s decision to use our products may be an enterprise-wide decision and, therefore, these types of sales require us to provide greater levels of education regarding the use and benefits of our applications. Further, given the constant innovation with our industry and our products, customers may delay purchasing decisions until certain features or products in development are brought to market. Longer sales cycles could cause our operating and financial results to suffer in a given period.\nTo compete effectively, we must continually improve existing products and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance.\nIn order to remain competitive and increase sales to customers, we must anticipate and adapt to the rapidly changing technologies in the enterprise video content management market, enhance our existing products and introduce new products to address the changing demands of our customers. If we fail to anticipate or respond to technological developments or customer requirements, or if we are significantly delayed in developing and introducing products, our revenues will decline.\nIf we fail to accurately predict customers\u2019 changing needs and emerging technological trends, our business could be harmed. We must commit significant resources and may incur obligations (such as royalty obligations) to develop new products and features before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept and without knowing the levels of revenue, if any, that may be derived from these products. Some of our competitors have greater engineering and product development resources than we have, allowing them to develop a greater number of products or improvements or to develop them more quickly.\nIf we fail to anticipate or respond in a cost-effective and timely manner to technological developments, changes in industry standards or customer requirements, or if we experience any significant delays in the development or introduction of new products or improvements to existing products, our business, operating results and financial condition could be affected adversely.\nWe face intense competition and such competition may result in price reductions, lower gross profits and loss of market share.\nOur products face intense competition, both from other products and from other technologies, both in the U.S. and in international markets. We compete with others such as Kaltura, Brightcove, MediaPlatform, Vbrick and Panopto who deliver video content to businesses. Qumu occasionally encounters organizations utilizing Microsoft\u2019s Skype and Stream technologies. While some view Microsoft as a competitor to Qumu, we believe that the Microsoft and Qumu technologies can be seamlessly integrated for the customer and provide the customer with greater flexibility and improved manageability than\nuse of a Microsoft technology alone. Further, because some prospective customers may choose to rely upon their own IT infrastructure and resources to manage their video content, we compete with customer-created solutions for video content management. We expect the intensity of competition we face to increase in the future from other established and emerging companies.\nMany of our competitors have greater resources than we do, including greater sales, product development, marketing, financial, technical or engineering resources. In addition, because our enterprise video content management software business is operating within an evolving marketplace, our target customers may prefer to purchase software products that are critical to their business from one of our larger, more established competitors.\nTo remain competitive, we believe that we must continue to provide:\n\u2022\ntechnologically advanced products and solutions that anticipate and satisfy the demands of end-users;\n\u2022\ncontinuing advancements or innovations in our product offerings, including products with price-performance advantages or value-added features in security, reliability or other key areas of customer interest;\n\u2022\ninnovations in video content creation, management, delivery and user experience;\n\u2022\na responsive and effective sales force;\n\u2022\na dependable and efficient sales distribution network;\n\u2022\nsuperior customer service; and\n\u2022\nhigh levels of quality and reliability.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors. Competition may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins, increased discounts to customers and loss of market share, and could require increased spending by us on research and development, sales and marketing and customer support.\nEconomic and market conditions, particularly those affecting our customers, have harmed and may continue to harm our business.\nUnfavorable changes in economic conditions, including recession, inflation, lack of access to capital, lack of consumer confidence or other changes have resulted and may continue to result in lower spending among our customers and target customers.\nFurther, we sell our products throughout the United States, as well as in several international countries to commercial and government customers. Our business may be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other countries such as disruptions in financial markets, reductions in government spending, or downturns in economic activity in specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which we operate; social, political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, tax rates, or regulations. These factors are beyond our control but may result in further decreases in spending among customers and softening demand for our products.\nFurther, challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services they have purchased. As a result, our cash flow may be negatively impacted and our allowance for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable may increase.\nOur sales will decline, and our business will be materially harmed, if our sales and marketing efforts are not effective.\nWe will need to continue to optimize our sales infrastructure in order to grow our customer base and our business. Identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them in the use and functionality of our software requires significant time, expense and attention. It can take six months or longer before our sales representatives are fully-trained and productive. If we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel or if new sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of this investment or increase our revenues. We also intend to expand new sales models that focus on different sales strategies tailored to different customer types. Our business may be adversely affected if our efforts to train our internal sales force or execute our selling strategies do not generate a corresponding increase in revenues.\nFor sales that are made to customers through our channel partners, we depend on these businesses to provide effective sales and marketing support to our products. Our channel partners are independent businesses that we do not control. Our agreements with channel partners do not contain requirements that a certain percentage of such parties\u2019 sales are of our products. These channel partners may choose to devote their efforts to other products in different markets or reduce or fail to devote the resources to provide effective sales and marketing support of our products, any of which could harm our business by reducing sales to customers.\nWe believe that our future growth and success will depend upon the success of our internal sales and marketing efforts as well as those of our channel partners.\nCompetition for highly skilled personnel is intense and if we fail to attract and retain talented employees, we may fail to compete effectively.\nOur future success depends, in significant part, on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees, particularly in senior management, product development and sales, is intense. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees given the high demand for these employees from other employers. Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.\nOur enterprise video content management software products must be successfully integrated into our customers\u2019 information technology environments and workflows and changes to these environments, workflows or unforeseen combinations of technologies may harm our customers\u2019 experience in using our software products.\nA significant portion of our sales are made into applications that require our enterprise video content management software products to be integrated into other enterprise workflows, enterprise information technology environments or software functionalities. Any significant changes to enterprise workflows, IT environments or software programs may limit the use or functionality of or demand for our products. As our customers advance technologically, we must be able to effectively integrate our products to remain competitive. Further, current and potential customers may choose to use products offered by our competitors or may not purchase our products if our products would require changes in their existing enterprise workflows, IT environments or software.\nThe growth and functionality of our enterprise video content management software products depend upon the solution\u2019s effective operation with mobile operating systems and computer networks.\nOur products are currently compatible with various mobile operating systems including the iOS, Windows Mobile and Android operating systems. The functionality of our products depends upon the continued interoperability of these products with popular mobile operating systems. Any changes in these systems that degrade our products\u2019 functionality or give preferential treatment to competitive offerings could adversely affect the operability and usage of our video management software products on mobile devices. Additionally, in order to deliver a high-quality user experience, it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies, systems, and networks. We may not be successful in keeping pace with changes in mobile technologies, operating systems, or networks or in developing products that operate effectively within existing or future technologies, systems, and networks. Further, any significant changes to mobile operating systems by their respective developers may prevent our products from working properly or at all on these systems. In the event that it is more difficult for users to access content delivered by our solutions to their mobile devices, if our products do not operate effectively within the most popular operating systems or if popular mobile devices do not offer a high-quality user experience, sales of and customer demand for our software products could be harmed.\nAny failure of major elements of our products could lead to significant disruptions in the ability to serve customers, which could damage our reputation, reduce our revenues or otherwise harm our business.\nOur business is dependent upon providing customers with fast, efficient and reliable services. A reduction in the performance, reliability or availability of required network infrastructure may harm our ability to distribute content to our customers, as well as our reputation and ability to attract and retain customers. Our content management software solutions and operations are susceptible to, and could be damaged or interrupted by, outages caused by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, Internet or mobile network breakdown, earthquake and similar events. Our solutions are also subject to human error, security breaches, power losses, computer viruses, break-ins, \u201cdenial of service\u201d attacks, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and tampering designed to disrupt our computer systems and network communications. Our failure to protect our network against damage from any of these events could harm our business.\nOur operations also depend on web browsers, ISPs (Internet service providers) and mobile networks to provide our customers\u2019 end-users with access to websites, streaming and mobile content. Many of these providers have experienced outages in the past, and could experience outages, delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to our solutions. Any such outage, delay or difficulty could adversely affect our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which would harm our business.\nIf we lose access to third-party licenses, our software product development and production may be delayed or we may incur additional expense to modify our products or products in development.\nSome of our solutions contain software licensed from third parties. Third-party licensing arrangements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nundetected errors or unauthorized use of another person\u2019s code in the third-party\u2019s software;\n\u2022\ndisagreement over the scope of the license and other key terms, such as royalties payable;\n\u2022\ninfringement actions brought by third-party licensees;\n\u2022\nthat third parties will create solutions that directly compete with our products; and\n\u2022\ntermination or expiration of the license.\nBecause of these risks, some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable to us or allow our products to remain competitive. The loss of these licenses or the inability to maintain any of them on commercially acceptable terms could delay development of future products or impair the functionality or enhancement of existing products, leading to increased expense associated with licenses of third-party software or development of alternative software to provide comparable functionality for our existing products and modification of our existing products. Further, if we lose or are unable to maintain any of these third-party licenses or are required to modify software obtained under third-party licenses, it could delay the release of new products, delay enhancements to our existing products or delay sales of our existing products. Any delays could result in loss of competitive position, loss of sales and loss of customer confidence, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf the limited amount of open source software that is incorporated into our products were to become unavailable or if we violate the terms of open source licenses, it could adversely affect sales of our products, which could disrupt our business and harm our financial results.\nOur products incorporate a limited amount of \u201copen source\u201d software. Open source software is made available to us and to the public by its authors or other third parties under licenses that impose certain obligations on licensees that re-distribute or make derivative works of the open source software. We may not be able to replace the functionality provided by the open source software currently incorporated in our products if that software becomes unavailable, obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products. In addition, we must carefully monitor our compliance with the licensing requirements applicable to that open source software. If we have failed or if in the future we fail to comply with the applicable license requirements, we might lose the right to use the subject open source software. The terms of some open source licenses would require us to give our customers significant rights to open source software that is subject to those licenses and is incorporated in our products. This would include the right to obtain from us the source code form of that open source software, and the right to use, modify and distribute that open source software to others. We may be required to provide these rights to customers on a royalty-free basis. Those rights might also extend to modifications and additions we make to the subject open source software. That open source software, and those modifications and additions, also might be obtained by our competitors and used in competing products.\nThe enforceability and interpretation of open source licenses remains uncertain under applicable law. Unfavorable court decisions could require us to replace open source software incorporated in our products. In some cases this might require us to obtain licenses to commercial software under terms that restrict our use of that commercial software and require us to pay royalties. In some cases we might need to redesign our software products, or to discontinue the sale of our software products if a redesign could not be accomplished on a timely basis. These same consequences result if our use of any open source software or commercial software is found to infringe any intellectual property right of another party. Any of these occurrences would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe sell a significant portion of our products internationally, which exposes us to risks associated with international operations.\nWe sell a significant amount of our products to customers outside the United States, particularly in Europe and Asia. We expect that sales to international customers, including customers in Europe and Asia, will continue to account for a significant portion of our net sales. Sales outside the United States involve the following risks, among others:\n\u2022\ninternational governments may impose tariffs, quotas and taxes;\n\u2022\nthe demand for our products will depend, in part, on local economic health;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability may reduce demand for our products;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate our ability to sell in certain markets;\n\u2022\npotentially limited intellectual property protection in certain countries may limit our recourse against infringing products or cause us to refrain from selling in certain markets;\n\u2022\npotential difficulties in managing our international operations;\n\u2022\nthe burden and cost of complying with a variety of international laws, including those relating to data security and privacy;\n\u2022\nwe may decide to price our products in foreign currency denominations;\n\u2022\nour contracts with international channel partners cannot fully protect us against political and economic instability;\n\u2022\npotential difficulties in collecting receivables; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to control our international channel partners\u2019 efforts on our behalf.\nThe financial results of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars for consolidation with our overall financial results. Currency translations and fluctuations may adversely affect the financial performance of our consolidated operations. Currency fluctuations may also increase the relative price of our product in international markets and thereby could also cause our products to become less affordable or less price competitive than those of international manufacturers. These risks associated with international operations may have a material adverse effect on our revenue from or costs associated with international sales.\nIf our domestic or international intellectual property rights are not adequately protected, others may offer products similar to ours or independently develop the same or similar technologies or otherwise obtain access to our technology and trade secrets which could depress our product selling prices and gross profit or result in loss of market share.\nWe believe that protecting our proprietary technology is important to our success and competitive positioning. In addition to common law intellectual property rights, we rely on patents, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, know-how, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. However, these legal means afford us only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or remedies to gain or keep any advantages we may have over our competitors.\nOur competitors, who may have or could develop or acquire significant resources, may make substantial investments in competing technologies, or may apply for and obtain patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to develop or market our products. Further, although we do not believe that any of our products infringe on the rights of others, third parties have claimed, and may claim in the future, that our products infringe on their rights, and these third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future.\nCostly litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us, to protect trade secrets or \u201cknow-how\u201d we own, to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the ownership, scope, or validity of our proprietary rights and the rights of others. Any claim of infringement against us may involve significant liabilities to third parties, could require us to seek licenses from third parties, and could prevent us from manufacturing, selling, or using our products. The occurrence of this litigation, or the effect of an adverse determination in any of this type of litigation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, the laws of some of the countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products and intellectual property to the same extent as the United States or at all. Our failure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in laws and regulations related to the Internet or changes in the Internet infrastructure itself may diminish the demand for our products, and could have a negative impact on our business.\nThe future success of our business depends in part upon the continued use of the Internet as a primary medium for commerce, communication and business applications. Federal, state or international government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, laws or regulations affecting the use of the Internet as a commercial medium. Changes in these laws or regulations could require us to modify our products in order to comply with these changes. In addition, government agencies or private organizations may begin to impose taxes, fees or other charges for accessing the Internet or commerce conducted via the Internet. These laws or charges could limit the growth of Internet-related commerce or communications generally, or result in reductions in the demand for Internet-based applications such as ours. The adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the Internet could limit the growth of the video as a mainstream communication and collaboration tool, limit the market for video content management software generally, and limit the demand for our products.\nIn addition, the use of the Internet as a business tool could be adversely affected due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased demands of Internet activity, security, reliability, cost, ease of use,\naccessibility, and quality of service. The performance of the Internet and its acceptance as a business tool has been adversely affected by \u201cviruses,\u201d \u201cworms\u201d and similar malicious programs and the Internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure. If the use of the Internet is adversely affected by these issues, demand for our applications could suffer.\nExpanding laws, regulations and customer requirements relating to data security and privacy may adversely affect sales of our products and result in increased compliance costs.\nOur customers can use our products to collect, use and store personal or identifying information regarding their employees, customers and suppliers. Federal, state and international government bodies and agencies have adopted, are considering adopting, or may adopt laws and regulations regarding data security, privacy and the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal information obtained from consumers and individuals. These laws and regulations could reduce the demand for our software products if we fail to design or enhance our products to enable our customers to comply with the privacy and security measures required by the legislation.\nWe also must comply with the policies, procedures and business requirements of our customers relating to data privacy and security, which can vary based upon the customer, the customer\u2019s industry or location, and the product the customer selects, and which may be more restrictive than the privacy and security measures required by law or regulation. In particular, the European Union and many countries in Europe have stringent privacy laws and regulations, which may impact our ability to profitably operate in certain European countries or to offer products that meet the needs of customers subject to European Union privacy laws and regulations.\nThe costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, our customers\u2019 own requirements and the privacy and security laws and regulations that are applicable to our customers\u2019 businesses may limit the use and adoption of our products and reduce overall demand. Non-compliance with our customers\u2019 specific requirements may lead to termination of contracts with these customers or liabilities to the customers; non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations may lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities.\nFurthermore, privacy concerns may cause our customers\u2019 workers to resist providing the personal data necessary to allow our customers to use our products effectively. If a customer experiences a significant data security breach involving our software products, our customers could lose confidence in our software\u2019s ability to protect the personal information of their employees, customers and suppliers, which could cause our customers to discontinue use of our products. The loss of confidence from a significant data security breach involving our software products could hurt our reputation, cause sales and marketing challenges to existing and new customers, cause loss of market share or exacerbate competitive pressures, result in an increase in our development costs to address any potential vulnerabilities in our software products, and may result in reduced demand and revenue. Even the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our products in certain industries.\nDomestic and international legislative and regulatory initiatives and our customers\u2019 privacy policies and practices may adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability to process, handle, store, use and transmit demographic and personal information from their employees, customers and suppliers, which could reduce demand for our products.\nIn addition to government activity, privacy advocacy groups and the technology and other industries are considering various new, additional or different self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on our software products. If the processing of personal information were to be curtailed in this manner, our software products would be less effective, which may reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business.\nWe may face circumstances in the future that could result in impairment charges, including, but not limited to, significant goodwill impairment charges.\nIf the fair value of any of our long-lived assets decreases as a result of an economic slowdown, a downturn in the markets where we sell products and services or a downturn in our financial performance and/or future outlook, we may be required to record an impairment charge on such assets, including goodwill.\nWe are required to test intangible assets with indefinite life periods for potential impairment annually and on an interim basis if there are indicators of a potential impairment. We also are required to evaluate amortizable intangible assets and fixed assets for impairment if there are indicators of a possible impairment. One potential indicator of impairment is the value of our market capitalization, or enterprise value, as compared to our net book value.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the Company\u2019s market capitalization, without a control premium, was greater than its book value and the Company concluded there was no goodwill impairment. Declines in the Company\u2019s market capitalization or a downturn in our future financial performance and/or future outlook could require the Company to record goodwill and other impairment charges. While a goodwill impairment charge is a non-cash charge, it would have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nWe may experience significant quarterly and annual fluctuations in our results of operations due to a number of factors and these fluctuations may negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nOur quarterly and annual results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. This variability may lead to volatility in our stock price as research analysts and investors respond to quarterly fluctuations and this volatility may be exacerbated by the relatively illiquid nature of our common stock. In addition, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-period basis, particularly on a sequential quarterly basis, may not be meaningful. You should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance.\nFactors that may affect our results of operations include:\n\u2022\nthe number and mix of products and solutions sold in the period;\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of our recorded revenue, which will depend upon the mix of products and solutions selected by our customers with revenue from paid-up perpetual software licenses being recognized upon delivery, revenue from term software licenses recognized over the term of the contract, and revenue from cloud-hosted services recognized over the term of the subscription agreement;\n\u2022\ntiming of customer purchase commitments, including the impact of long sales cycles and seasonal buying patterns;\n\u2022\nvariability in the size of customer purchases and the impact of large customer orders on a particular period;\n\u2022\nthe timing of major development projects and market launch of new products or improvements to existing products;\n\u2022\nreductions in our customers\u2019 budgets for information technology purchases and delays in their purchasing cycles, due to changing global economic or market conditions;\n\u2022\nthe impact to the marketplace of competitive products and pricing;\n\u2022\nthe timing and level of operating expenses;\n\u2022\nthe impact on revenue and expenses of acquisitions by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nfuture accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies; and\n\u2022\nthe impact of a recession or any other adverse global economic conditions on our business, including uncertainties that may cause a delay in entering into or a failure to enter into significant customer agreements.\nThe foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could adversely affect our quarterly and annual results of operations. Failure to achieve our quarterly or annual forecasts or to meet or exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors may cause our stock price to decline abruptly and significantly.\nThe limited liquidity for our common stock could affect your ability to sell your shares at a satisfactory price.\nOur common stock is relatively illiquid. As of December 31, 2018, we had 9,624,060 shares of common stock outstanding. The average daily trading volume in our common stock, as reported by the Nasdaq Stock Market, for the 63 trading days beginning October 1, 2018 and ending December 31, 2018 was approximately 17,100 shares. A more active public market for our common stock may not develop, which could adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of our common stock. Moreover, a thin trading market for our stock could cause the market price for our common stock to fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. Without a larger float, our common stock is less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership. As a result, the trading prices of our common stock have been and may continue to be more volatile. In addition, in the absence of an active public trading market, shareholders may be unable to liquidate their shares of our common stock at a satisfactory price.\nProvisions of Minnesota law, our bylaws and other agreements may deter a change of control of our company and may have a possible negative effect on our stock price.\nCertain provisions of Minnesota law, our bylaws and other agreements may make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire, or discourage a third-party from attempting to acquire, control of our company, including:\n\u2022\nthe provisions of Minnesota law relating to business combinations and control share acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe provisions of our bylaws regarding the business properly brought before shareholders;\n\u2022\nthe right of our board of directors to establish more than one class or series of shares and to fix the relative rights and preferences of any such different classes or series;\n\u2022\nthe provisions of our stock incentive plans allowing for the acceleration of vesting or payments of awards granted under the plans in the event of specified events that result in a \u201cchange in control\u201d;\n\u2022\nthe provisions of our agreements provide for severance payments to our executive officers in the event of certain terminations following a \u201cchange in control\u201d; and\n\u2022\nthe provisions of our credit agreement requiring prepayment in full of our term loan upon a change in control.\nThese measures could discourage or prevent a takeover of our company or changes in our management, even if an acquisition or such changes would be beneficial to our shareholders. This may have a negative effect on the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 78054, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "QUMU"}
