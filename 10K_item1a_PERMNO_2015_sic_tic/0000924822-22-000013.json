RISK FACTORS\nThere are many factors that affect our business and the results of our operations, some of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of all known material risks that may cause the actual results of our operations in future periods to differ materially from those currently expected or desired. We encourage you to read this section carefully.\nRisks Relating to Our Operations\nThe continuing COVID-19 pandemic has, and could in the future continue to, materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe U.S. and other countries are experiencing outbreaks of several variants of COVID-19, which are continuing to spread to areas where we, our customers, our suppliers and our end users do business. The outbreak has resulted in governments around the world implementing at times stringent measures to help control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, \u201cshelter in place\u201d and \u201cstay at home\u201d orders, travel restrictions, business curtailments, school closures, and other measures. We are considered a critical infrastructure industry, as defined by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and were thus exempt from state and local business closure orders that were previously in effect in states where we have manufacturing facilities. However, as the pandemic continues, such orders and restrictions may be implemented or reinstated in states or localities that experience a rebound or surge in COVID-19 cases, including as a result of the emergence of new variants of the virus that may be more transmissible or virulent. Other organizations, businesses and individuals are taking additional steps to avoid or reduce infection, including limiting travel and staying home from work. These measures taken to curb the spread of COVID-19 are disrupting normal business operations both in and outside of affected areas, including our business operations.\nWe have made and continue to make what we believe to be appropriate modifications to our operations because of COVID-19 to allow us to protect our employees while operating all our facilities consistent with applicable governmental guidelines and orders. We continue to monitor government recommendations impacting our operations and may need to enact further precautionary measures to help minimize the risk of our employees being exposed to COVID-19, which could have a further adverse impact on our plant production levels. If our employees are unable to work effectively, including due to illness, quarantines, any temporary limited suspension of operations, government actions or other restrictions in connection with COVID-19 or variants of COVID-19, our operations may be adversely affected.\nThe businesses of towing and recovery equipment operators have been disrupted and they have limited and may continue to limit spending as a result of COVID-19, which could negatively impact their willingness to purchase new equipment from us or our independent distributors, and ultimately adversely affect our revenues. During the first half of 2020 we saw order cancellations and softening of demand, and although demand has since strengthened, it could again worsen depending on the duration, spread, and severity of the ongoing pandemic. The cancellation of major industry shows and events also reduced our ability to meet with existing and potential new customers to market our products.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a material adverse impact on our financial results and business operations, and economic and health conditions in the United States and across most of the globe continue to change dramatically from day to day as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations is unknown and will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of new strains of the virus and any future resurgences of COVID-19 or variant strains, the timing for our chassis and component parts suppliers resuming normal shipment levels, the effect of the pandemic on spending levels of towing and recovery equipment operators, the effect of the pandemic on our employees and employee turnover rates, including the impact of any vaccine mandates that might be implemented, and any additional preventative and protective actions that governments, or we or other businesses, may direct, which may result in an extended period of continued business disruption and reduced operations. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but should be anticipated to continue to have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may experience materially adverse impacts to our business due to any resulting economic recession or depression, or to a general reduction in miles driven on roadways due to a decrease in travel.\nOur dependence upon outside suppliers for component parts, chassis and raw materials, including aluminum, steel, and petroleum-related products, leaves us subject to changes in price and availability (including as a result of increased demand due to improving economic conditions, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain difficulties) and delays in receiving supplies of such parts, chassis or materials.\nWe are dependent upon outside suppliers for our raw material needs and other purchased component parts. Prices and availability of these raw materials are subject to substantial fluctuations that are beyond our control due to factors such as changing economic conditions, inflation, currency and commodity price fluctuations, tariffs, resource availability, transportation costs, weather conditions and natural disasters, political unrest and instability, war (such as the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine) and other factors impacting supply and demand pressures. Delays in shipments of our raw materials and purchased component parts, including truck chassis, and government actions related to tariffs on imports and trade policies have previously adversely impacted, and have the potential to further impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition. We also will be monitoring the potential impact of the Russia conflict with Ukraine on our fuel costs and supply chain for materials, parts and components, particularly with respect to steel and items with substantial steel content.\nOur third-party suppliers\u2019 ability to supply us with component parts and chassis is limited by their available capacity to manufacture the component parts and chassis we require, and to secure adequate freight capacity to deliver them to our facilities. As the economy began to recover from the impact of the pandemic over the course of 2021, various supply chain disruptions impacted our ability to obtain on a timely basis certain raw materials and purchased component parts that are necessary to our production processes, as well as chassis from third party suppliers, and also resulted in substantial price increases for many materials and parts, and we are continuing to experience such difficulties in early 2022. These supply chain difficulties have had a material adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations. Delays in deliveries of our finished products due to delays of purchased component parts and truck chassis used in our products could also adversely affect future demand for our products if our customers reduce their purchase levels with us and/or seek alternative solutions to meet their demand. If these delays, limitations on availability and price increases for raw materials, purchased component parts, and chassis continue, recur or worsen, they will continue to have a material adverse effect on production at our facilities.\nFurthermore, as a result of our supply chain challenges, it has become more difficult to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport to our manufacturing facilities purchased materials, component parts and chassis at sufficient volumes. If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual needs, or successfully manage our inventory or our workforce to adapt to the increased complexity in our supply chain, we may incur unexpected production disruption, as well as storage, transportation and labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to meet our customers\u2019 delivery schedules and could face the loss of orders or customers as a result.\nTo partially offset price increases for raw materials and purchased component parts, we have implemented multiple general price increases and cost surcharges during 2021 and have several others scheduled to take effect in the first half of 2022. While we have attempted to pass these increased costs on to our customers, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future. Any further price increases for raw materials or purchased component parts that we use would require a long lead time to implement while the higher material costs would be felt much sooner.\nShortages, price increases and/or delays in shipments of our raw materials and purchased component parts, including truck chassis, have had and should be anticipated to continue to have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial performance, competitive position and reputation.\nWe depend upon skilled labor to manufacture our products. Our business has recently been, and may continue to be, negatively affected by increased employee turnover rates and problems hiring and retaining skilled labor.\nThe timely manufacture and delivery of our products requires an adequate supply of skilled labor, and the operating costs of our manufacturing facilities can be adversely affected by high turnover in skilled positions. Accordingly, our ability to increase or maintain our current levels of sales, productivity and net earnings will be limited to a degree by our ability to employ the skilled laborers necessary to meet our requirements. We must attract, train and retain skilled employees while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values, including safety standards. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and increases in healthcare and other insurance costs.\nIn addition, employee turnover rates in the broader global economy have increased over the past year and may continue to remain elevated. Since the economy has begun to recover from the impact of the pandemic, we have experienced substantial increases in employee turnover and difficulties in hiring new workers for our skilled workforce, which has caused increased recruiting, training and retention costs. These workforce headwinds generally worsened over the course of the second half of 2021 and are continuing in 2022. This trend is anticipated to continue over the near term, and possibly longer. While the federal mandate of vaccinations for larger employers is now blocked in the courts and apparently no longer being pursued, implementation of any such government mandated vaccine program could impact our ability to retain current employees and attract new employees. Further, implementation could also have similar consequences for our suppliers, which may impact their ability to deliver the goods and services we need from them. We continue to monitor this workforce turnover and attempt to mitigate the risk associated with it through increased recruiting, training and retention efforts. The impact of these disruptions remains largely out of our control, and we currently anticipate that these factors will continue to have a material adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations during the first half of 2022 and possibly beyond.\nWe invest significant time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them. If we fail to retain our employees, we could incur significant expenses in hiring and training their replacements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to efficiently operate our facilities. In addition, while our employees are not currently members of a union, there can be no assurance that the employees at any of our facilities will not choose to become unionized in the future.\nDemand from our customers and towing operators is affected by the availability of capital and access to credit.\nThe ability of our customers and of towing operators to purchase our products is affected by the availability of capital and credit to them. Our independent distributor customers rely on floor plan financing in connection with the purchase of our products, and the availability of that financing on acceptable terms has a direct effect on the volume of their purchases. More restrictive lending practices or an increase in the cost of such financing can prevent distributors from carrying adequate levels of inventory, which limits product offerings available to the end customer and could lead to reduced sales of our products. Additionally, in many cases, a towing operator\u2019s decision to purchase our products from one of our distributors is dependent upon their ability to obtain financing upon acceptable terms. Volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, principally in the U.S. and Europe, in the past has decreased the availability of capital to, and credit capacity of, our customers and towing operators. In addition, in the past, certain providers of floor plan financing have exited the market, which made floor plan financing increasingly difficult for our independent distributor customers to secure at those times. This reduced availability of capital and credit has negatively affected the ability and capacity of our customers and of towing operators to purchase towing and related equipment. This, in turn, has negatively impacted sales of our products. If customers are unable to access capital or credit, it could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products, and as a result, could negatively affect our business and operating results.\nOperational challenges caused by our increased sales volumes in recent years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic could result in material delays, increased costs and loss of business opportunities, which could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nSubstantially increased sales of our products over the five years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic have caused a variety of operating challenges, including supply chain constraints and production capacity limitations. The recent major additions and renovations to all our domestic production facilities have allowed us to effectively address these challenges, but they have nevertheless caused increased production costs and delayed deliveries to customers in some instances. These factors could in the future result in delay or termination of orders, the loss of sales and a negative impact on our reputation with our customers, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our recent major additions and renovations to all our domestic facilities may not achieve our intended objectives of lowering costs, improving manufacturing efficiencies in an environmentally conscious way and increasing productivity, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur international operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties that could adversely affect our business results, including by restrictive taxation or other government regulation and by foreign currency fluctuation.\nHistorically, a portion of our net sales occur outside the United States, primarily in Europe. In addition, we have manufacturing operations at two facilities located in the Lorraine region of France and manufacturing operations in Norfolk, England. As a result, our operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties, including risks of restrictive taxation policies, changing political conditions and governmental regulations and trade policies. This includes the uncertainty surrounding the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the United Kingdom\u2019s \u201cBrexit\u201d from the European Union and their impact on European and worldwide economic and supply chain conditions, and on our international sales. These developments have created and may continue to create legal, political and\neconomic uncertainties and impacts, including disruptions to trade and free movement of goods, services and people to and from Europe, disruptions to our workforce or the workforce of our suppliers or business partners. All of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, a portion of our net sales derived outside the United States, as well as salaries of employees located outside the United States and certain other expenses, are denominated in foreign currencies, including the British pound sterling and the euro. We are, therefore, subject to risk of financial loss resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates of these currencies against the U.S. dollar. Brexit has caused, and may continue to result in, significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies in which we conduct business, including both the British pound sterling and the euro.\nIn addition, political unrest, terrorist acts, military conflict, including the ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and disease outbreaks, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have increased the risks of doing business abroad in general.\nOur business is subject to the cyclical nature of our industry and changes in consumer confidence and in economic conditions in general, including the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on global economies. Adverse changes or continued uncertainty with respect to these factors may lead to a downturn in our business.\nThe towing and recovery industry is cyclical in nature. In years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall demand for our products and resulting revenues had been positively affected by recovering economic conditions and improving consumer sentiment. However, historically, the overall demand for our products and our resulting revenues have at times been negatively affected by wavering levels of consumer confidence, volatility and disruption in domestic and international capital and credit markets and the resulting decrease in the availability of financing for our customers and towing operators and the overall effects of global economic conditions. We remain concerned about the potential effects of these factors on the towing and recovery industry, and we continue to monitor our overall cost structure to see that it remains in line with business conditions. A prolonged economic downturn, including as a result of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, political unrest, terrorist acts, military conflict and any other disease outbreaks, and slow or negative growth in the domestic and global economy, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations for the foreseeable future.\nOur sales to U.S. and other governmental entities through prime contractors are subject to special risks.\nWe act as a subcontractor for certain U.S. and other government programs. As a result, we are subject to extensive regulations and requirements of the U.S. and other government agencies and entities that govern these programs, including with respect to the award, administration and performance of contracts under such programs. Our U.S. and other government business is subject to the following risks, among others: (i) this business is susceptible to changes in government spending, which may reduce future revenues; (ii) most of our contracts with governmental entities through prime contractors are fixed-price contracts, and our actual costs on any of these contracts could exceed our projected costs, (iii) competition for the award of these contracts is intense, and we may not be successful in bidding on future contracts, and (iv) the products we sell to governmental entities are subject to highly technical requirements, and any failure to comply with these requirements could result in unanticipated retrofit costs, delayed acceptance of products, late or reduced payment or cancellation of the contract. Our inability to address any of the foregoing concerns could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOverall demand from our customers may be affected by increases in their fuel and insurance costs and changes in weather conditions.\nIn the past, our customers have experienced substantial increases in fuel and other transportation costs, and in the cost of insurance. Our customers also have, from time to time, been subject to unpredictable and varying weather conditions which could, among other things, impact the cost and availability of fuel and other materials. The ongoing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine is likely to result in substantial increases in fuel costs worldwide, and the extent and duration of such increases cannot be predicted at this time. Any of these factors could negatively affect our customers\u2019 capacity for purchasing towing and related equipment, and, consequently, have a material negative effect upon our business and operating results.\nOur competitors could impede our ability to attract or retain customers.\nThe towing and recovery equipment manufacturing industry is highly competitive. Capital requirements for entry into the towing and recovery manufacturing industry have been relatively low, which could result in an increase in the number of competitors entering the\nindustry. Competition for sales exists domestically and internationally at the manufacturer, distributor and towing-operator levels and is based primarily on product quality and innovation, reputation, technology, customer service, product availability and price. Competition for sales also comes from the market for used towing and recovery equipment. Certain of our competitors may have substantially greater financial and other resources and may provide more attractive dealer and retail customer financing alternatives than us. If these competitors are able to make it more difficult for us to attract or retain customers, it could have a negative impact on our sales, revenue and financial performance.\nThe catastrophic loss of one of our manufacturing facilities could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we manufacture our products in several facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss, a catastrophic loss of the use of all or a portion of any one of our manufacturing facilities due to accident, labor issues, weather conditions, natural disaster, civil unrest, terrorist acts, military conflict and disease outbreaks (including the COVID-19 pandemic), or otherwise, whether short or long-term, could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations.\nRisks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Matters\nEnvironmental and health and safety liabilities and requirements could require us to incur material costs.\nWe are subject to various U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the ground, air and water; the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials; and the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties. In certain cases, these regulatory requirements may limit the productive capacity of our operations.\nEnvironmental and health-related requirements are complex, subject to change and have tended to become more and more stringent. Future developments could cause us to incur various expenditures and could also subject us to fines or sanctions, obligations to investigate or remediate contamination or restore natural resources, liability for third party property damage or personal injury claims and the imposition of new permitting requirements and/or the modification or revocation of our existing operating permits, among other effects. These and other developments could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nOur facilities and operations could in the future be subject to regulations related to climate change and climate change itself may also have some impact on the Company\u2019s operations. However, these impacts are currently uncertain and the Company cannot presently predict the nature and scope of those impacts.\nFailure to comply with domestic and foreign anti-corruption laws could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur international operations require us to comply with a number of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those involving anti-bribery and anti-corruption. Failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act, and other foreign anti-bribery laws could have an adverse effect on our business. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in our incurring significant fees and having fines and criminal sanctions imposed on us or our employees, and could adversely impact our business with government entities.\nOur future success depends upon our ability to develop or acquire proprietary products and technology and assertions against us relating to intellectual property rights could harm our business.\nHistorically, we have been able to develop or acquire patented and other proprietary product innovations which have allowed us to produce what management believes to be technologically advanced products relative to most of our competition. While we are continuing to develop new technology and apply for patents, if we are unable to develop or acquire new products and technology in the future, our ability to maintain market share, and, consequently, our revenues and operating results, may be negatively affected.\nThird parties may claim that our products infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. If a competitor were to challenge our patents, or assert that our products or processes infringe its patent or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial litigation costs, be forced to design around their patents, pay substantial damages or even be forced to cease our operations, any of which could be\nexpensive and/or have an adverse effect on our operating results. Third party infringement claims, regardless of their outcome, would not only consume our financial resources, but also would divert the time and effort of our management and could result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products or services until resolution of the litigation.\nChanges in the tax regimes and related government policies and regulations in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our results and our effective tax rate.\nAs a result of our international operations, we are subject to various taxes in both U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws, regulations and rates in these various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our future effective income tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Changes to long-standing tax principles in the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities. Increases in our effective tax rate or tax liabilities could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe effects of regulations relating to conflict minerals may adversely affect our business.\nIn 2012, the SEC adopted rules under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as \u201cconflict minerals\u201d, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These rules could adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of such minerals if they are found to be used in the manufacture of our products, as the number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, we have incurred and expect to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products. In addition to the SEC regulation, the European Union adopted new requirements for European Union importers of conflict minerals, which went into effect on January 1, 2021, and that may impact and increase the cost of our conflict minerals compliance program. The Company\u2019s supply chain is complex. As a result, we have encountered and continue to expect significant difficulty in determining the country of origin or the source and chain of custody for all \u201cconflict minerals\u201d used in our products and disclosing that our products are \u201cconflict free\u201d (meaning that they do not contain \u201cconflict minerals\u201d that directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country). We may face reputational challenges from customers, investors or others if we are unable to verify the origins for all \u201cconflict minerals\u201d used in our products. In such event, we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict mineral free.\nA product warranty or product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage, or an inability to acquire or maintain insurance at commercially reasonable rates, could have a material adverse effect upon our business.\nWe are subject to various claims, including product warranty and product liability claims arising in the ordinary course of business, and may at times be a party to various legal proceedings incidental to our business. We maintain reserves and liability insurance coverage at levels based upon commercial norms and our historical claims experience. If we manufacture poor quality products or receive defective materials, we may incur unforeseen costs in excess of what we have reserved in our financial statements. A successful product warranty, product liability or other claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage, or the inability of us to acquire or maintain insurance at commercially reasonable rates, could have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we are subject to potential recalls of components or parts manufactured by suppliers which we purchase and incorporate into our towing and recovery equipment products, as well as potential recalls of our products from customers to cure manufacturing defects or in the event of a failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards or customers\u2019 order specifications. Moreover, the adverse publicity that may result from a product liability claim, perceived or actual defect with our products or a product recall could have a material adverse effect on our ability to market our products successfully.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may fluctuate greatly as a result of the general volatility of the stock market.\nFrom time to time, there may be significant volatility in the market price for our common stock. Our quarterly operating results, changes in earnings estimated by analysts, if any, changes in general conditions in our industry or the economy or the financial markets or other developments affecting us, including our ability to pay dividends, could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.\nOur charter and bylaws contain anti-takeover provisions that may make it more difficult or expensive to acquire us in the future or may negatively affect our stock price.\nOur charter and bylaws contain restrictions that may discourage other persons from attempting to acquire control of us, including, without limitation, prohibitions on shareholder action by written consent and advance notice requirements regarding amendments to certain provisions of our charter and bylaws. In addition, our charter authorizes the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The rights and preferences for any series of preferred stock may be set by the board of directors, in its sole discretion and without shareholder approval, and the rights and preferences of any such preferred stock may be superior to those of common stock and thus may adversely affect the rights of holders of common stock.\nRisks Related to Indebtedness and Liquidity\nOur credit facility could restrict our ability to operate our business and failure to comply with its terms could adversely affect our business; our obligations to repurchase products from third-party lenders to our distributors could adversely impact our future revenues and financial condition.\nOur credit facility contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and financial, affirmative and negative covenants for loan agreements of this kind. In addition, covenants under our current credit facility restrict our ability to pay cash dividends if the Company would be in violation of the minimum tangible net worth test or the leverage ratio test in the current loan agreement as a result of the dividend, among various restrictions. We have been in compliance with these covenants throughout 2021 and anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance during 2022. If we fail to comply with the requirements of our current credit facility, such non-compliance would result in an event of default. If not waived by the bank, such event of default would result in the acceleration of any amounts due under the current credit facility.\nWe also have certain obligations to repurchase our products repossessed by third-party lenders if our distributors should default in their obligations to those lenders. Such repurchases could result in reduced net revenue in future periods as we resell such products and, if we are unable to sell the products, could adversely impact our financial condition.\nWe cannot assure you that we will continue to declare dividends on our common stock.\nOur board of directors approved a dividend policy in 2011 to consider and pay quarterly dividends on our common stock subject to our ability to satisfy all applicable statutory requirements and our continued financial strength. While we currently intend to pay a quarterly dividend on shares of our common stock, to the extent that we have sufficient funds available for such purpose, the declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on shares of common stock will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and we may reduce or discontinue entirely the payment of such dividends at any time. Our board of directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and operating results, capital requirements, restrictions in financing agreements and such other factors as they may deem relevant from time to time.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nA disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology (\"IT\") systems or any violation of data protection laws could adversely impact our business and operations.\nWe rely on the accuracy, capacity and security of our IT systems and our ability to update these systems in response to the changing needs of our business. We use our IT systems to collect and store confidential and sensitive data, including information about our business, our customers, our suppliers and our employees. We rely on IT systems to protect this information and to keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, and operate other critical functions. Our IT systems may be disrupted or fail for a number of reasons, including natural disasters, such as fires; power loss; software \u201cbugs\u201d, hardware defects or human error or malfeasance; or security breaches caused by hacking, computer viruses, malware, ransomware or other cyber-attacks. The risk of such cyber-attacks may be heightened as a result of the Russian conflict with Ukraine.\nAs technology continues to evolve, we anticipate that we will collect and store even more data in the future and that our systems will increasingly use remote communication features that are susceptible to both willful and unintentional security breaches. We have incurred costs and expect to incur significant additional costs in order to implement security measures that we feel are appropriate to protect our IT systems. Despite these efforts, future attacks could result in our systems or data being breached and/or damaged by computer viruses\nor unauthorized physical or electronic access. Such a breach could result in theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets and/or unauthorized access to controlled data and personal information stored in connection with our human resources function. In the event of a breach in security that allows third parties access to personal information, we are subject to a variety of ever-changing laws on a global basis that may require us to provide notification to the data owners, and that may subject us to lawsuits, fines and other means of regulatory enforcement or harm employee morale.\nAny disruption, outage or breach of our IT systems could result in interruption of our business operations, damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in our security measures, all of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, if our systems are improperly implemented, breached, damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them. To the extent that any data is lost or destroyed or any confidential information is inappropriately disclosed or used, it could adversely affect our competitive position or customer relationships, harm our business and possibly lead to significant claims, liability, or fines based upon alleged breaches of contract or applicable laws, which liabilities may not be covered by insurance. The Company is also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal data in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other customer, vendor or employee data. Regulators globally are also imposing greater monetary fines for privacy violations including the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) that became effective in the European Union in 2018. The GDPR and other changes in laws or regulations associated with the enhanced protection of certain types of sensitive data, such as healthcare data or other personal information, could increase our cost of providing our products and services.\nAny loss of the services of our key executives could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nOur success is highly dependent on the continued services of our management team. The loss of services of one or more key members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on us.", "PERMNO": 80828, "SIC": 3713, "TIC": "MLR"}
