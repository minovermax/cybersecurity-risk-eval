RISK FACTORS\nWhen considering any investment in our securities, investors should consider the following risk factors, as well as the information contained under the caption \u201cInformation Concerning Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d in analyzing our present and future business performance. While this list is not exhaustive, management also places no priority or likelihood based on their descriptions or order of presentation. Unless indicated otherwise or the content requires otherwise, references below to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d should be read to refer to the Company and its subsidiaries.\nOur investments in clean energy projects are subject to substantial risks and competition.\nCommercial and residential solar energy projects and onshore wind projects, such as those in which we invest, are dependent upon current regulatory and tax incentives and there is uncertainty about the extent to which such incentives will be available in the future. The potential return on investment of these solar projects is based substantially on our eligibility for ITCs and the future market for SRECs that are traded in a competitive marketplace in the State of New Jersey. As a result, these projects face the risk that the current regulatory regimes and tax laws may expire or be adversely modified during the life of the projects. Furthermore, a sustained decrease in the value of SRECs would negatively impact the return on investment of solar projects. Legislative changes or declines in the price of SRECs could also lead to an impairment of solar project assets. The market for such projects is also limited, which creates competition for customers and higher investment costs and could potentially result in lost investment opportunities.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nIn addition, there are risks associated with our ability to develop and manage such projects profitably, including logistical risks and potential delays related to construction, permitting, regulatory approvals (including any approvals by the BPU required pursuant to recently enacted solar energy legislation in the State of New Jersey) and electric grid interconnection, as well as the operational risk that the projects in service will not perform according to expectations due to equipment failure, suboptimal weather conditions or other economic factors beyond our control. All of the aforementioned risks could reduce the availability of viable solar energy projects for development. Furthermore, at the development or acquisition stage, our ability to predict actual performance results may be hindered and the projects may not perform as predicted.\nWe may be unable to obtain governmental approvals, property rights and/or financing for the construction, development and operation of our proposed energy investments and projects in a timely manner or at all.\nConstruction, development and operation of energy investments, such as natural gas storage facilities, NJNG infrastructure improvements, such as SRL and NJ RISE, pipeline transportation systems, such as PennEast and IEC, solar energy projects and onshore wind projects are subject to federal and state regulatory oversight and require certain property rights, such as easements and rights-of-way from public and private property owners, as well as regulatory approvals, including environmental and other permits and licenses for such facilities and systems. We or our joint venture partnerships may be unable to obtain, in a cost-efficient or timely manner, all such needed property rights, permits and licenses to successfully construct and develop our energy facilities and systems. Successful financing of our energy investments requires participation by willing financial institutions and lenders, as well as acquisition of capital at favorable interest rates. If we do not obtain the necessary regulatory approvals, property rights and financing, our equity investments could be impaired. Such impairment could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUncertainties associated with our planned acquisition of IEC could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Furthermore, any acquisitions that we undertake might involve risks and uncertainties. We may not realize the anticipated synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities as a result of these transactions.\nIn October 2017, we announced the entry into an agreement to purchase IEC, whose principle operations relate to the operation and maintenance of an oil and natural gas transmission pipeline extending approximately 90 miles into eastern Pennsylvania. As part of the acquisition we expect to convert the remaining sections of the southern mainline of the pipeline utilized to transport oil to transport natural gas. The completion of the acquisition is subject to various closing conditions, including, but not limited to, receipt of necessary permits and regulatory actions, such as those from the FERC and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, and other pending regulatory determinations, such as compliance with anti-trust laws. There can be no assurance that we will receive the necessary approvals for the transaction or receive them within the expected timeframe. The announcement and pendency of the IEC acquisition, as well as any delays in the expected timeframe, could cause disruption and create uncertainties, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, regardless of whether the acquisition is completed.\nFurthermore, the integration of any acquisition requires significant time and resources, which could result in significant ongoing operating expenses and may divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. If we fail to successfully integrate assets and liabilities through the entities which we acquire, we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and, as a result, the fair value of assets acquired could be impaired and could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe benefits that we expect to achieve from acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize anticipated growth opportunities and other synergies with our existing businesses. The success of these transactions will depend on our ability to integrate these transactions within our existing businesses timely and seamlessly. We may experience challenges when combining separate business cultures, information technology systems and employees. Even if we are able to complete the integration successfully, we may not fully realize all of the growth opportunities, cost savings and other synergies that we expect.\nMajor changes in the supply and price of natural gas may affect financial results.\nWhile NJNG expects to meet the demand for natural gas from its customers for the foreseeable future, factors impacting suppliers and other third parties, including increased competition, further deregulation, transportation costs, possible climate change legislation, transportation availability and drilling for new natural gas resources, may impact the supply and price of natural gas. NJNG actively hedges against the fluctuation in the price of natural gas by entering into forward and financial contracts with third parties. Should these third parties fail to perform and regulators not allow the pass-through of expended funds to customers, it may result in a loss that could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nSignificant regulatory assets recorded by NJNG could be disallowed for recovery from customers in the future.\nNJNG records regulatory assets on its financial statements to reflect the ratemaking and regulatory decision-making authority of the BPU as allowed by GAAP. The creation of a regulatory asset allows for the deferral of costs, which, absent a mechanism to recover such costs from customers in rates approved by the BPU, would be charged to expense on its income statement in the period incurred. Primary regulatory assets that are subject to BPU approval include the recovery of BGSS and USF costs, remediation costs associated with NJNG's MGP sites, CIP, NJCEP, economic stimulus plans, certain deferred income tax and pension and other postemployment benefit plans. If there were to be a change in regulatory positions surrounding the collection of these deferred costs there could be a material impact on NJNG\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nNJR is a holding company and depends on its operating subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations.\nNJR is a holding company with no significant assets other than possible cash investments and the stock of its operating subsidiaries. We rely exclusively on dividends from our subsidiaries, on intercompany loans from our unregulated subsidiaries, and on the repayments of principal and interest from intercompany loans and reimbursement of expenses from our subsidiaries for our cash flows. Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and to pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt depends on the payment of dividends to us by our subsidiaries or the repayment of loans to us by our subsidiaries. The extent to which our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or repay funds to us may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock and principal and interest to holders of our debt.\nNJNG\u2019s regulated operations are subject to certain operating risks incidental to handling, storing, transporting and providing customers with natural gas.\nNJNG\u2019s regulated operations are subject to all operating hazards and risks incidental to handling, storing, transporting and providing customers with natural gas, including its NGV refueling stations and LNG facilities. These risks include explosions, pollution, release of toxic substances, fires, storms, safety issues and other adverse weather conditions and hazards, each of which could result in damage to or destruction of facilities or damage to persons and property. NJNG could suffer substantial losses should any of these events occur. Moreover, as a result, NJNG has been, and likely will be, a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Although NJNG maintains insurance coverage, insurance may not be sufficient to cover all material expenses related to these risks.\nNJNG and Energy Services rely on storage, transportation assets and suppliers, which they do not own or control, to deliver natural gas.\nNJNG and Energy Services depend on natural gas pipelines and other storage and transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver natural gas to wholesale and retail markets and to provide retail energy services to customers. Their ability to provide natural gas for their present and projected sales will depend upon their suppliers\u2019 ability to obtain and deliver additional supplies of natural gas, as well as NJNG\u2019s ability to acquire supplies directly from new sources. Factors beyond the control of NJNG, its suppliers and the independent suppliers that have obligations to provide natural gas to certain NJNG customers, may affect NJNG\u2019s ability to deliver such supplies. These factors include other parties\u2019 control over the drilling of new wells and the facilities to transport natural gas to NJNG\u2019s citygate stations, competition for the acquisition of natural gas, priority allocations, impact of severe weather disruptions to natural gas supplies, the regulatory and pricing policies of federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as the availability of Canadian reserves for export to the United States. Energy deregulation legislation may increase competition among natural gas utilities and impact the quantities of natural gas requirements needed for sales service. Energy Services also relies on a firm supply source to meet its energy management obligations to its customers. If supply, transportation or storage is disrupted, including for reasons of force majeure, the ability of NJNG and Energy Services to sell and deliver their products and services may be hindered. As a result, they may be responsible for damages incurred by their customers, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative supply at then-current market rates. Particularly for Energy Services, these conditions could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks related to the regulation of NJNG could affect the rates it is able to charge, its costs and its profitability.\nNJNG is subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities. These authorities regulate many aspects of NJNG\u2019s distribution and transmission operations, including construction and maintenance of facilities, operations, safety, tariff rates that NJNG can charge customers, rates of return, the authorized cost of capital, recovery of pipeline replacement, environmental remediation costs and relationships with its affiliates. NJNG\u2019s ability to obtain rate increases, including base rate increases, extend\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nits BGSS incentive and CIP programs and maintain its currently authorized rates of return may be impacted by events, including regulatory or legislative actions. There can be no assurance that NJNG will be able to obtain rate increases and continue its BGSS incentive, CIP, RAC and SAVEGREEN programs or continue the opportunity to earn its currently authorized rates of return.\nA change in our effective tax rate as a result of a failure to qualify for ITCs and PTCs or being delayed in qualifying for ITCs due to delays or failures to complete planned solar energy projects and wind projects within the safe harbor period may have a material impact on our earnings.\nGAAP requires that we apply an effective tax rate to interim periods that is consistent with our estimated annual effective tax rate. As a result, we project quarterly the annual effective tax rate and then adjust the tax expense recorded in that quarter to reflect the projected annual effective tax rate. The amount of the quarterly adjustment is based on information and assumptions, which are subject to change and may have a material impact on our quarterly and annual NFE. Factors we consider in estimating the probability of projects being completed during the fiscal year include, but are not limited to, Board of Directors approval, construction logistics, permitting, interconnection completion and execution of various contracts, including PPAs. If we fail to qualify for ITCs or are delayed in qualifying for some ITCs during the fiscal year due to delays or failures to complete planned solar energy projects as scheduled, our quarterly and annual net income and NFE may be materially impacted. This could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFor a wind facility to be considered a qualified facility for purposes of the PTCs, the construction of the facility must have begun prior to January 1, 2020, and placed in service before January 1, 2024. A taxpayer may establish that construction has begun by starting \u201cphysical work of a significant nature.\u201d Only physical work of a significant nature on tangible personal property used as an integral part of the activity performed by the facility is considered for purposes of determining when construction begins. Alternatively, a taxpayer may establish that construction has begun by paying or incurring five percent of eligible project costs (the \u201cfive percent safe harbor\u201d).\nWe are involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies that could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe are involved in legal or administrative proceedings before various courts and governmental bodies with respect to general claims, rates, taxes, environmental issues, gas cost prudence reviews and other matters. Adverse decisions regarding these matters, to the extent they require us to make payments in excess of amounts provided for in our financial statements or covered by insurance, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nCyberattacks or failure of information technology systems could adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe continue to place greater reliance on technological tools that support our business operations and corporate functions, including tools that help us manage our natural gas distribution operations and infrastructure. The failure of, or security breaches related to, these technologies could materially adversely affect our business operations, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on information technology to manage our natural gas distribution and other corporate operations, maintain customer, employee, Company and vendor data, prepare our financial statements and perform other critical business processes. This technology may fail due to cyberattack, physical disruption, design and implementation defects or human error. Disruption or failure of business operations and information technology systems could harm our facilities or otherwise adversely impact our ability to safely deliver natural gas to our customers, serve our customers effectively or manage our assets. Additionally, an attack on, or failure of information technology systems, could result in the unauthorized release of customer, employee or other confidential or sensitive data. Any of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business reputation, diminish customer confidence, disrupt operations, subject us to financial liability or increased regulation, increase our costs and expose us to material legal claims and liability.\nThere is no guarantee that redundancies built into our networks and technology, or the procedures we have implemented to protect against cyberattack and other unauthorized access to secured data, are adequate to safeguard against all failures of technology or security breaches.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nCredit rating downgrades could increase financing costs, limit access to the financial markets and negatively affect NJR and its subsidiaries.\nRating agencies Moody\u2019s and S&P currently rate NJNG\u2019s debt as investment grade. If such ratings are downgraded below investment grade, borrowing costs could increase, as will the costs of maintaining certain contractual relationships and obtaining future financing. Even if ratings are downgraded without falling below investment grade, NJR and NJNG could face increased borrowing costs under their current credit facilities. Our ability to borrow and costs of borrowing have a direct impact on our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to execute their operating strategies, particularly in the case of NJNG, which relies heavily upon capital expenditures financed by its credit facility.\nIf we suffer a reduction in our credit and borrowing capacity or in our ability to issue parental guarantees, the business prospects of Energy Services, Clean Energy Ventures and Midstream, which rely on our creditworthiness, would be adversely affected. Energy Services could possibly be required to comply with various margin or other credit enhancement obligations under its trading and marketing contracts, and it may be unable to continue to trade or be able to do so only on less favorable terms with certain counterparties. Clean Energy Ventures could be required to seek alternative financing for its projects, and may be unable to obtain such financing or able to do so only on less favorable terms. In addition, NJNR Pipeline may not be able to finance its capital obligations to PennEast.\nAdditionally, lower credit ratings could adversely affect relationships with NJNG\u2019s state regulators, who may be unwilling to allow NJNG to pass along increased costs to its natural gas customers.\nWe are subject to governmental regulation. Compliance with current and future regulatory requirements and procurement of necessary approvals, permits and certificates may result in substantial costs to us.\nWe are subject to substantial regulation from federal, state and local regulatory authorities. We are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations and to obtain numerous authorizations, permits, approvals and certificates from governmental agencies. These agencies regulate various aspects of our business, including customer rates, services, construction and natural gas pipeline operations.\nThe FERC has regulatory authority over some of our operations, including sales of natural gas in the wholesale and retail markets and the purchase and sale of interstate pipeline and storage capacity. Any Congressional legislation or agency regulation that would alter these or other similar statutory and regulatory structures in a way to significantly raise costs that could not be recovered in rates from customers, that would reduce the availability of supply or capacity or that would reduce our competitiveness could negatively impact our earnings. In addition, changes in and compliance with laws such as the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011 could increase federal regulatory oversight and administrative costs that may not be recovered in rates from customers, which could have an adverse impact on our earnings.\nWe cannot predict the impact of any future revisions or changes in interpretations of existing regulations or the adoption of new laws and applicable regulations. Changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could influence our operating environment and may result in substantial costs to us.\nAdverse economic conditions, including inflation, increased natural gas costs, foreclosures and business failures, could adversely impact NJNG\u2019s customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness.\nInflation may cause increases in certain operating and capital costs. We continually review the adequacy of NJNG\u2019s base tariff rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those rates. The ability to control operating expenses is an important factor that will influence future results.\nRapid increases in the price of purchased gas may cause NJNG to experience a significant increase in short-term debt because it must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased, which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly bills for gas delivered to customers. Increases in purchased gas costs also slow collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills, leading to higher-than-normal accounts receivable.\nIf we are unable to access the financial markets or there are adverse conditions in the equity or credit markets, it could affect management\u2019s ability to execute our business plans.\nWe rely on access to both short-term and long-term credit markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by our cash flow from operations. Any deterioration in our financial condition could hamper our ability to access the equity or credit markets or otherwise obtain debt financing on terms favorable to us or at all. In addition, because certain state\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nregulatory approvals may be necessary for NJNG to incur debt, NJNG may be unable to access credit markets on a timely basis. External events could also increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to access the financial markets. Such external events could include the following:\n\u2022\neconomic weakness and/or political instability in the United States or in the regions where we operate;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions, such as a shutdown of the U.S. federal government;\n\u2022\nfinancial difficulties of unrelated energy companies;\n\u2022\ncapital market conditions generally;\n\u2022\nvolatility in the equity markets;\n\u2022\nmarket prices for natural gas;\n\u2022\nthe overall health of the natural gas utility industry; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in interest rates, particularly with respect to NJNG\u2019s variable rate debt instruments.\nOur ability to secure short-term financing is subject to conditions in the credit markets. A prolonged constriction of credit availability could affect management\u2019s ability to execute our business plan. An inability to access capital may limit our ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions that we may otherwise rely on for both current operations and future growth.\nEnergy Services and NJNG execute derivative transactions with financial institutions as a part of their economic hedging strategy and could incur losses associated with the inability of a financial counterparty to meet or perform under its obligations as a result of adverse conditions in the credit markets or their ability to access capital or post collateral.\nThe cost of providing pension and postemployment health care benefits to eligible former employees is subject to changes in pension fund values, interest rates and changing demographics and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe have two defined benefit pension plans and two OPEB plans for the benefit of eligible full-time employees and qualified retirees, which were closed to all employees hired on or after January 1, 2012. The cost of providing these benefits to eligible current and former employees is subject to changes in the market value of the pension and OPEB fund assets, changing discount rates and changing actuarial assumptions based upon demographics, including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries, an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five years, impacts from healthcare legislation and increases in health care costs.\nSignificant declines in equity markets and/or reductions in bond yields can have a material adverse effect on the funded status of our pension and OPEB plans. In these circumstances, we may be required to recognize increased pension and OPEB expenses and/or be required to make additional cash contributions into the plans.\nThe funded status of these plans, and the related cost reflected in our financial statements, are affected by various factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, losses of asset values may necessitate increased funding of the plans in the future to meet minimum federal government requirements. A significant decrease in the asset values of these plans can result in funding obligations earlier than we had originally planned, which would have a negative impact on cash flows from operations, decrease our borrowing capacity and increase our interest expense.\nWe are exposed to market risk and may incur losses in our wholesale business.\nOur storage and transportation portfolios consist of contracts to transport and store natural gas. The value of our storage and transportation portfolio could be negatively impacted if the value of these contracts change in a direction or manner that we do not anticipate. In addition, upon expiration of these storage and transportation contracts, to the extent that they are renewed or replaced at less favorable terms, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nOur economic hedging activities that are designed to protect against commodity and financial market risks, including the use of derivative contracts in the normal course of Energy Services\u2019 business, may cause fluctuations in reported financial results and financial losses that negatively impact results of operations and our stock price.\nWe use derivatives, including futures, forwards, options, swaps and foreign exchange contracts to manage commodity, financial market and foreign currency risks. The timing of the recognition of gains or losses associated with our economic hedges in accordance with GAAP does not always coincide with the gains or losses on the items being hedged. The difference in accounting can result in volatility in reported results, even though the expected profit margin is essentially unchanged from the dates the transactions were consummated.\nIn addition, Energy Services could recognize financial losses on these contracts as a result of volatility in the market values of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. In the absence of actively quoted market prices and pricing information from external sources, the valuation of these financial instruments can involve management\u2019s judgment or use of estimates. As a result, changes in the underlying assumptions or use of alternative valuation methods could adversely affect the value of the reported fair value of these contracts.\nEnergy Services' earnings and cash flows are dependent upon optimization of its physical assets.\nEnergy Services' earnings and cash flows are based, in part, on its ability to optimize its portfolio of contractual-based natural gas storage and pipeline assets. The optimization strategy involves utilizing its physical assets to take advantage of differences in natural gas prices between geographic locations and/or time periods. Any change among various pricing points could affect these differentials. In addition, significant increases in the supply of natural gas in Energy Services' market areas, including as a result of increased production along the Marcellus Shale, can reduce Energy Services' ability to take advantage of pricing fluctuations in the future. Changes in pricing dynamics and supply could have an adverse impact on Energy Services' optimization activities, earnings and cash flows. Energy Services incurs fixed demand fees to acquire its contractual rights to storage and transportation assets. Should commodity prices at various locations or time periods change in such a way that Energy Services is not able to recoup these costs from its customers, the cash flows and earnings at Energy Services, and ultimately the Company, could be adversely impacted.\nA valuation allowance may be required for our deferred tax assets.\nA valuation allowance may need to be recorded against our net deferred tax assets, which are predominantly related to net operating losses, based on available evidence, including cumulative and forecasted taxable income at the time the estimate is made. A valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws, statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. In the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax assets in the future, we would reduce such amounts accordingly through a charge to income tax expense in the period in which that determination was made, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations may negatively affect our results of operations, net income, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to taxation by various taxing authorities at the federal, state and local levels. The current administration has made federal corporate tax reform one of its priorities and the possibility of such reform is thought to be increased in light of the Republican-led Congress. While such reform is likely to be favorable to corporations generally, the structure of any such reform is unknown and a change in tax laws or rates could in fact adversely affect our results of operations, net income, financial condition and cash flows. We cannot predict the timing or structure of such tax-related developments.\nChanges in weather conditions may affect earnings and cash flows.\nWeather conditions and other natural phenomena can have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows. Severe weather conditions can impact suppliers and the pipelines that deliver gas to NJNG\u2019s distribution system. Extended mild weather, during either the winter period or summer period, can have a significant impact on demand for and the cost of natural gas. While we believe the CIP mitigates the impact of weather variations on NJNG\u2019s gross margin, severe weather conditions may have an impact on the ability of suppliers and pipelines to deliver the natural gas to NJNG, which can negatively affect our earnings. The CIP does not mitigate the impact of severe weather conditions on our cash flows.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nFuture results at Energy Services are subject to volatility in the natural gas market due to weather. Variations in weather may affect earnings and working capital needs throughout the year. During periods of milder temperatures, demand and volatility in the natural gas market may decrease, which can negatively impact Energy Services' earnings and cash flows.\nFailure by NJR and/or NJNG to comply with debt covenants may impact our financial condition.\nOur long-term debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debt-to-capital ratios and, in the case of NJNG, an interest coverage ratio. These debt obligations also contain provisions that put limitations on our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to expand or pursue certain business activities. For example, certain of these agreements contain provisions that, among other things, put limitations on our ability to make loans or investments, make material changes to the nature of our businesses, merge, consolidate or engage in asset sales, grant liens or make negative pledges. Furthermore, the debt obligations contain covenants and other provisions requiring us to provide timely delivery of accurate financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. The failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations and/or the inability to borrow under existing revolving credit facilities. We have relied, and continue to rely, upon short-term bank borrowings or commercial paper supported by our revolving credit facilities to finance the execution of a portion of our operating strategies. NJNG is dependent on these capital sources to purchase its natural gas supply and maintain its properties. The acceleration of our outstanding debt obligations and our inability to borrow under the existing revolving credit facilities would cause a material adverse change in NJR\u2019s and NJNG\u2019s financial condition.\nChanges in customer growth may affect earnings and cash flows.\nNJNG\u2019s ability to increase its utility firm gross margin is dependent upon the new construction housing market, as well as the conversion of customers to natural gas from other fuel sources. During periods of extended economic downturns, prolonged weakness in housing markets or slowdowns in the conversion market, there could be an adverse impact on NJNG\u2019s utility firm gross margin, earnings and cash flows. Furthermore, while our estimate regarding customer growth is based in part upon information from third parties, the estimate has not been verified by an independent source and is subject to the aforementioned risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to materially deviate from the estimate.\nWe may be adversely impacted by natural disasters, pandemic illness, terrorist activities and other extreme events to which we may be unable to promptly respond.\nLocal or national natural disasters, pandemic illness, terrorist activities and other extreme events are a threat to our assets and operations. Companies in our industry that are located in our service territory may face a heightened risk due to exposure to acts of terrorism that could target or impact our natural gas distribution, transmission and storage facilities and disrupt our operations and ability to meet customer requirements. In addition, the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations. Natural disasters or actual or threatened terrorist activities may also disrupt capital markets and our ability to raise capital, or may impact our suppliers or our customers directly. A local disaster or pandemic illness could result in part of our workforce being unable to operate or maintain our infrastructure or perform other tasks necessary to conduct our business. In addition, these risks could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental damage, impairment of our operations and substantial loss to the Company. Our regulators may not allow us to recover from our customers part or all of the increased cost related to the foregoing events, which could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe maintain emergency planning and training programs to readily respond to events that could cause business interruption. However, a slow or inadequate response to events may have an adverse impact on operations and earnings. We may be unable to obtain sufficient insurance to cover all risks associated with local and national disasters, pandemic illness, terrorist activities and other events, which could increase the risk that an event adversely affects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur costs of compliance with present and future environmental laws are significant and could adversely affect our cash flows and profitability.\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and site remediation. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to expend significant financial resources to, among other things, conduct site remediation and perform environmental\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS (Continued)\nmonitoring. If we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, even if we are unable to do so due to factors beyond our control, we may be subject to civil liabilities or criminal penalties and may be required to incur significant expenditures to come into compliance. Additionally, any alleged violations of environmental laws and regulations may require us to expend significant resources in our defense against alleged violations.\nFurthermore, the U.S. Congress has for some time been considering various forms of climate change legislation. There is a possibility that, when and if enacted, the final form of such legislation could impact our costs and put upward pressure on natural gas prices. Higher cost levels could impact the competitive position of natural gas and negatively affect our growth opportunities, cash flows and earnings.\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified employee workforce could adversely affect operations.\nOur ability to implement our business strategy and serve our customers is dependent upon our continuing ability to attract and retain talented professionals and a technically skilled workforce, and being able to transfer the knowledge and expertise of our workforce to new employees as our aging employees retire. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, or the future availability and cost of contract labor could adversely affect the ability to manage and operate our business. Furthermore, the majority of our natural gas distribution segment workforce is represented by the Union and is covered by a collective bargaining agreement that will expire in December 2018. Disputes with the Union over terms and conditions of the agreement could result in instability in our labor relationship and work stoppages that could impact the timely delivery of gas and other services from our utility, which could strain relationships with customers and state regulators and cause a loss of revenues that could adversely affect our results of operations. Our collective bargaining agreement may also increase the cost of employing our natural gas distribution segment workforce, affect our ability to continue offering market-based salaries and employee benefits, limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce, and limit our ability to change work rules and practices and implement other efficiency-related improvements to successfully compete in today\u2019s challenging marketplace.\nInvesting through partnerships, joint ventures or in an MLP decreases our ability to manage risk.\nWe have utilized joint ventures through partnerships for certain midstream investments, including Steckman Ridge and PennEast, and we own a minority interest in DM, an MLP, through our investment in DM Common Units. Although we currently have no specific plans to do so, we may acquire interests in other joint ventures or partnerships in the future. In these joint ventures or partnerships, we may not have the right or power to direct the management and policies of the joint ventures or partnerships, and other participants or investors may take action contrary to our instructions or requests and against our policies and objectives. In addition, the other participants may become bankrupt or have economic or other business interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of NJR and our subsidiaries. Our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be harmed if a joint venture participant acts contrary to our interests.\nAdditionally, our investment in DM has risks that are unique to investments in MLPs. Holders of MLP common units have limited control and voting rights on matters affecting the MLP, and investments in MLPs may have limited liquidity. Additionally, if DM is treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes as a result of a change in current law or a change in DM\u2019s business, such treatment would result in a reduction in the after-tax return to us and may cause a reduction in the value of our investment in DM Common Units.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay or prevent a transaction that stockholders would view as favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as New Jersey law, contain provisions that could delay, defer or prevent an unsolicited change in control of NJR, which may negatively affect the market price of our common stock or the ability of stockholders to participate in a transaction in which they might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market price. These provisions may also prevent changes in management. In addition, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval on such terms as our Board of Directors may determine. Our common stockholders will be subject to, and may be negatively affected by, the rights of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. In addition, we are subject to the New Jersey Shareholders\u2019 Protection Act, which could delay or prevent a change of control of NJR.\nNew Jersey Resources Corporation\nPart I", "PERMNO": 64450, "SIC": 4924, "TIC": "NJR"}
