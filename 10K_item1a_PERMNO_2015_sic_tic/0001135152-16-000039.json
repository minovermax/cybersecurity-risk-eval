RISK FACTORS\nImportant risk factors that could impact our ability to achieve our anticipated operating results and growth plan goals are presented below. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with discussions of our business and the factors affecting our business located elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC.\nDemand for our products and services depends on oil and gas industry activity and expenditure levels, which are directly affected by trends in the demand for and price of crude oil and natural gas.\nWe are substantially dependent on conditions in the oil and gas industry, including the level of exploration, development and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies. Any substantial or extended decline in these expenditures may result in the reduced pace of discovery and development of new reserves of oil and gas and the reduced exploitation of existing wells, which could adversely affect demand for our products and services and, in certain instances, result in the cancellation, modification or rescheduling of existing orders in our backlog. These factors could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profitability. The level of exploration, development and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices, which, historically, have been volatile.\nFactors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\ndemand for hydrocarbons, which is affected by worldwide population growth, economic growth rates and general economic and business conditions;\n\u2022\ncosts of exploring for, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic uncertainty and sociopolitical unrest;\n\u2022\navailable excess production capacity within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d) and the level of oil production by non-OPEC countries;\n\u2022\noil refining capacity and shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\npotential acceleration of the development of alternative fuels;\n\u2022\naccess to capital and credit markets, which may affect our customers\u2019 activity levels and spending for our products and services; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters.\nThe oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on the prices we charge. The current downturn in the oil and gas industry has resulted in a reduction in demand for oilfield services and could further adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe industries in which we operate or have operated expose us to potential liabilities arising out of the installation or use of our products that could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe are subject to potential liabilities arising from equipment malfunctions and failures, particularly due to high temperature and pressure environments, equipment misuse and natural disasters, the occurrence of which may result in uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids, fires and explosions. Although we have obtained insurance against many of these risks, our insurance may not be adequate to cover our liabilities. Further, the insurance may not generally be available in the future or, if available, premiums may not be commercially justifiable. If we incur substantial liability and the damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits, or if we were to incur liability at a time when we are not able to obtain liability insurance, such potential liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nOur operations require us to comply with numerous U.S. and international regulations, violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are exposed to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations relating to matters such as environmental, health and safety, labor and employment, import/export control, currency exchange, bribery and corruption and taxation. These laws and regulations are complex, frequently change and have tended to become more stringent over time. In the event the scope of these laws and regulations expand in the future, the incremental cost of compliance could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur operations outside of the United States require us to comply with numerous anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations under the laws of the United States and various other countries. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) Bribery Act and the Brazilian Anti-Bribery Act (also known as the Brazilian Clean Company Act), among others, apply to us and our operations. We have internal control policies and procedures and have implemented training and compliance programs for our employees and agents with respect to these regulations. However, our policies, procedures and programs may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents, and severe criminal or civil sanctions may be imposed as a result of violations of these laws. We are also subject to the risks that our employees, joint venture partners and agents outside of the United States may fail to comply with applicable laws.\nMoreover, we import raw materials, semi-finished goods, as well as finished products into many countries for use in such countries or for manufacturing and/or finishing for re-export and import into another country for use or further integration into equipment or systems. Most movement of raw materials, semi-finished or finished products involves imports and exports. As a result, compliance with multiple trade sanctions, embargoes and import/export laws and regulations, as well as the recently enacted conflict minerals reporting requirements, pose a constant challenge and risk to us since our business is conducted on a worldwide basis through various subsidiaries. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could materially affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations in the United States and foreign countries affect the equipment, systems and services we design, market and sell, as well as the facilities where we manufacture our equipment and systems. We are required to invest financial and managerial resources to comply with environmental laws and regulations and believe that we will continue to be required to do so in the future. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, or the issuance of orders enjoining operations. These laws and regulations, as well as the adoption of new legal requirements or other laws and regulations affecting exploration and development of drilling for crude oil and natural gas, could adversely affect our business and operating results by increasing our costs, limiting the demand for our products and services or restricting our operations.\nInternational, national and state governments and agencies are currently evaluating and/or promulgating legislation and regulations that are focused on restricting emissions commonly referred to as greenhouse gas (\u201cGHG\u201d) emissions. For instance, under the U.S. Clean Air Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) has made findings that GHG emissions endanger public health and the environment, resulting in the EPA\u2019s adoption of regulations requiring construction and operating permit reviews of certain stationary sources with major emissions of GHGs, which reviews require the installation of new GHG emission control technologies. The EPA has also promulgated rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain sources, including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities and onshore oil and natural gas processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. In addition, in August 2015, the EPA announced proposed rules that would establish new air emission controls for methane emissions from certain new, modified or reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities, as part of an overall effort to reduce methane emissions by up to 45 percent by 2025. To the extent our customers are subject to these or other similar proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations, the additional costs incurred by our customers to comply with such laws and regulations could impact their ability or desire to continue to operate at current or anticipated levels, which would negatively impact their demand for our products and services. In addition, any new laws or regulations establishing cap-and-trade or that favor the increased use of non-fossil fuels may dampen demand for oil and gas production and lead to lower spending by our customers for our products and services. Similarly, to the extent we are or become subject to any of these or other similar proposed or newly enacted laws and regulations, we expect that our efforts to monitor, report and comply with such laws and regulations, and any related taxes imposed on companies by such programs, will increase our cost of doing business and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nMoreover, environmental concerns have been raised regarding the potential impact of hydraulic fracturing on underground water supplies. Although we do not perform hydraulic fracturing, we do provide equipment and services to companies employing this enhanced recovery technique. There have been several regulatory and governmental initiatives in the United States to restrict the hydraulic fracturing process, which could have an adverse impact on our customers\u2019 completion or production activities. For example, the EPA has issued final regulations under the U.S. Clean Air Act governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing and proposed in April 2015 the prohibition of the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Also, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management finalized rules in March 2015 that impose new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands. The U.S. District Court of Wyoming has temporarily stayed implementation of this rule, and a final decision has not yet been issued. These and other similar state and foreign regulatory initiatives, if adopted, would establish additional levels of regulation for our customers that could make it more difficult for our customers to complete natural gas and oil wells and could adversely affect the demand for our equipment and services, which, in turn, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nDisruptions in the political, regulatory, economic and social conditions of the countries in which we conduct business could adversely affect our business or results of operations.\nWe operate manufacturing facilities in the United States and in various countries across the world. Instability and unforeseen changes in any of the markets in which we conduct business, including economically and politically volatile areas such as North Africa, West Africa, the Middle East and the Commonwealth of Independent States, could have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and services, our financial condition or our results of operations. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nnationalization and expropriation;\n\u2022\npotentially burdensome taxation;\n\u2022\ninflationary and recessionary markets, including capital and equity markets;\n\u2022\ncivil unrest, labor issues, political instability, terrorist attacks, cyber-terrorism, military activity and wars;\n\u2022\nsupply disruptions in key oil producing countries;\n\u2022\nability of OPEC to set and maintain production levels and pricing;\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions, trade protection measures or price controls;\n\u2022\nforeign ownership restrictions;\n\u2022\nimport or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on operations, trade practices, trade partners and investment decisions resulting from domestic and foreign laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges in, and the administration of, laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ninability to repatriate income or capital;\n\u2022\nreductions in the availability of qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations or currency restrictions; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the interest rate component of forward foreign currency rates.\nBecause a significant portion of our revenue is denominated in foreign currencies, changes in exchange rates will produce fluctuations in our revenue, costs and earnings and may also affect the book value of our assets and liabilities located outside of the United States and the amount of our stockholders\u2019 equity. Although it is our policy to seek to minimize our currency exposure by engaging in hedging transactions where appropriate, our efforts may not be successful. Moreover, certain currencies, specifically currencies in countries such as Angola and Nigeria where we have sizable operations, do not actively trade in the global foreign exchange markets and may subject us to increased foreign currency exposures. Refer to \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d in Part II, Item 7A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of foreign currency rate risk. To the extent we sell our products and services in foreign markets, currency fluctuations may result in our products and services becoming too expensive for foreign customers. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect our financial position or results of operations.\nWe may lose money on fixed-price contracts.\nAs customary for the types of businesses in which we operate, we often agree to provide products and services under fixed-price contracts. Under these contracts, we are typically responsible for cost overruns. Our actual costs and any gross profit realized on these fixed-price contracts may vary from the estimated amounts on which these contracts were originally based. There is inherent risk in the estimation process, including significant unforeseen technical and logistical challenges or longer than expected lead times. A fixed-price contract may prohibit our ability to mitigate the impact of unanticipated increases in raw material prices through increased pricing. Depending on the size of a project, variations from estimated contract performance could have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nDisruptions in the timely delivery of our backlog could affect our future sales, profitability, and our relationships with our customers.\nMany of the contracts we enter into with our customers require long manufacturing lead times due to complex technical and logistical requirements. These contracts may contain clauses related to liquidated damages or financial incentives regarding on-time delivery, and a failure by us to deliver in accordance with customer expectations could subject us to liquidated damages or loss of financial incentives, reduce our margins on these contracts or result in damage to existing customer relationships. The ability to meet customer delivery schedules for this backlog is dependent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, access to the raw materials required for production, an adequately trained and capable workforce, subcontractor performance, project engineering expertise and execution, sufficient manufacturing plant capacity and appropriate planning and scheduling of manufacturing resources. Failure to deliver backlog in accordance with expectations could negatively impact our financial performance, particularly in light of the current industry environment where customers may seek to improve their returns or cash flows.\nDue to the types of contracts we enter into, the cumulative loss of several major contracts or alliances may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe often enter into large, long-term contracts that, collectively, represent a significant portion of our revenue. These agreements, if terminated or breached, may have a larger impact on our operating results or our financial condition than shorter-term contracts due to the value at risk. If we were to lose several key alliances or agreements over a relatively short period of time we could experience a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIncreased costs of raw materials and other components may result in increased operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by our inability to manage the rising costs and availability of raw materials and components used in our wide variety of products and systems. Unexpected changes in the size and timing of regional and/or product markets, particularly for short lead-time products, could affect our results of operations or cash flows.\nIn accordance with Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC\u2019s rules regarding mandatory disclosure and reporting requirements by public companies of their use of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d (tantalum, tin, tungsten and gold) originating in the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries became effective in 2014. While the conflict minerals rule continues in effect as adopted, there remains uncertainty regarding how the conflict minerals rule, and our compliance obligations, will be affected in the future. Additional requirements under the rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain of the conflict minerals used in the manufacture of our products or in the provision of our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to purchase these products in the future. The costs of compliance, including those related to supply chain research, the limited number of suppliers and possible changes in the sourcing of these minerals, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.\nA failure of our information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems. Accordingly, we rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our IT hardware and software infrastructure and our ability to expand and update this infrastructure in response to our changing needs. Despite our implementation of security measures, our systems are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, incursions by intruders or hackers, failures in hardware or software, power fluctuations, cyber terrorists and other similar disruptions. Additionally, we rely on third parties to support the operation of our IT hardware and software infrastructure, and in certain instances, utilize web-based applications. Although no such material incidents have occurred to date, the failure of our IT systems or those of our vendors to perform as anticipated for any reason or any significant breach of security could disrupt our business and result in numerous adverse consequences, including reduced effectiveness and efficiency of operations, inappropriate disclosure of confidential and proprietary information, reputational harm, increased overhead costs and loss of important information, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nOur success depends on our ability to implement new technologies and services.\nOur success depends on the ongoing development and implementation of new product designs and improvements and on our ability to protect and maintain critical intellectual property assets related to these developments. If we are not able to obtain patent or other protection of our technology, we may not be able to continue to develop systems, services and technologies to meet evolving industry requirements, and if so, at prices acceptable to our customers.\nUninsured claims and litigation against us, including intellectual property litigation, could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe could be impacted by the outcome of pending litigation, as well as unexpected litigation or proceedings. We have insurance coverage against operating hazards, including product liability claims and personal injury claims related to our products, to the extent deemed prudent by our management and to the extent insurance is available. However, no assurance can be given that the nature and amount of that insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities arising out of pending and future claims and litigation. Our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected by unexpected claims not covered by insurance.\nIn addition, the tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. Infringement claims generally result in significant legal and other costs. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if available, would increase our costs. If a license were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, developing non-infringing technologies would increase our costs.\nA deterioration in future expected profitability or cash flows could result in an impairment of our recorded goodwill.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently when impairment indicators arise. A lower fair value estimate in the future for any of our reporting units could result in goodwill impairments. Factors that could trigger a lower fair value estimate include changes in customer demand, cost increases, regulatory or political environment changes, and other changes in market conditions, such as decreased prices in similar market-based transactions, which could impact future earnings of the reporting unit.\nAt December 31, 2015, recorded goodwill of $63.7 million was associated with our U.S. surface integrated services reporting unit. The decline in crude oil prices that began in 2014 and continued throughout 2015 has introduced uncertainty associated with certain key assumptions used in estimating fair value of the reporting unit. Depressed crude oil and natural gas prices for a prolonged period of time may adversely affect the economics of our customers\u2019 projects, particularly shale-related projects in North America, which may lead to the reduction in demand for our products and services, negatively impacting the financial results of the reporting unit. Our estimate of fair value for the U.S. surface integrated services reporting unit relies on third party forecasts of the number of hydraulic fracturing stages expected to be completed as well as the expected recovery of the overall North American oil and gas market. Management is monitoring the overall market, specifically crude oil and natural gas prices, and its effect on the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test for U.S. surface integrated services, which may require re-evaluation and could result in an impairment of goodwill for this reporting unit.\nAt December 31, 2015, recorded goodwill of $54.7 million was associated with our separation systems reporting unit. The decline in crude oil prices and its related effect on customer capital spending has led to negative margins for separation systems in 2015. Our estimate of fair value for the separation systems reporting unit relies on assumptions of lower oil and gas activity over the next few years with expected market recovery in 2019 for this business. To mitigate the impact of lower commodity prices, management is expanding the reporting unit\u2019s existing product offering in both greenfield and brownfield applications by introducing differentiating technology and expanding the system and solutions business as a growth platform. Management is monitoring the overall market, specifically crude oil prices and changes in customer capital spending, and its effect on the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment test for separation systems, which may require re-evaluation and could result in an impairment of goodwill for this reporting unit.\nRefer to \u201cCritical Accounting Estimates\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion regarding estimates and assumptions surrounding goodwill.\nA downgrade in our debt rating could restrict our ability to access the capital markets.\nThe terms of our financing are, in part, dependent on the credit ratings assigned to our debt by independent credit rating agencies. We cannot provide assurance that any of our current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, capital structure, planned asset purchases or sales, near- and long-term production growth opportunities, market position, liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix, customer and geographic diversification and commodity price levels. A downgrade in our credit ratings, particularly to non-investment grade levels, could limit our ability to access the debt capital markets, refinance our existing debt or cause us to refinance or issue debt with less favorable terms and conditions. Moreover, our revolving credit agreement includes an increase in interest rates if the ratings for our debt are downgraded, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. An increase in the level of our indebtedness and related interest costs may increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions and may affect our ability to obtain additional financing.\nOur industry is undergoing consolidation that may impact our results of operations.\nOur industry, including our customers and competitors, is undergoing consolidation which may affect demand for our products and services as a result of price concessions or decreased customer capital spending. This consolidation activity could have a significant negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We are unable to predict what effect consolidations in the industry may have on prices, capital spending by our customers, our selling strategies, our competitive position, our ability to retain customers or our ability to negotiate favorable agreements with our customers.\nOur businesses are dependent on the continuing services of certain of our key managers and employees.\nWe depend on key personnel. The loss of any key personnel could adversely impact our business if we are unable to implement key strategies or transactions in their absence. The loss of qualified employees or an inability to retain and motivate additional highly-skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to successfully conduct research activities and develop marketable products and services.", "PERMNO": 89004, "SIC": 3533, "TIC": "FTI.1"}
