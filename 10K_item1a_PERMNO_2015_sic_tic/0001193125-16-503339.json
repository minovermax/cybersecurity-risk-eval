{"cik": "1084717", "company": "PACIFIC CONTINENTAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A Risk Factors\nWe are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the following information:\nIndustry Factors\nThe continued challenges in the U.S. and our region\u2019s economies could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations or market price of our stock; there can be no assurance that U.S. governmental measures responding to these challenges will successfully address these circumstances; the U.S. government continues to face significant fiscal and budgetary challenges which, if not resolved, may further exacerbate U.S. economic conditions.\nThe national economy and the financial services sector in particular are still facing challenges. A large percentage of our loans are to businesses in western Washington and Oregon, markets facing many of the same challenges as the national economy, including elevated unemployment and weakness in commercial and residential real estate values. Although some economic indicators are improving both nationally and in the markets we serve, there remains uncertainty regarding the strength of the economic recovery. A continued slow economic recovery could result in the following consequences, any of which could have an adverse impact, which may be material, on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and could also cause the market price of our stock to decline:\n\u2022\nEconomic conditions may not stabilize, increasing the likelihood of credit defaults by borrowers.\n\u2022\nLoan collateral values, especially as they relate to commercial and residential real estate, may decline, thereby increasing the severity of loss in the event of loan defaults.\n\u2022\nDemand for banking products and services may decline, including loan products and services for low cost and noninterest-bearing deposits.\n\u2022\nChanges and volatility in interest rates may negatively impact the yields on earning assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities.\nOur earnings and growth are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, particularly the Federal Reserve. Refer to \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-K for discussion of certain of these measures. In response to the adverse financial and economic developments that have, since 2008, impacted the U.S. and global economies and financial markets, and presented challenges for the banking and financial services industry and for our Company, various significant economic and monetary stimulus measures were implemented by the U.S. Congress. The Federal Reserve has pursued a highly accommodative monetary policy aimed at keeping interest rates at historically low levels although the Federal Reserve has begun to taper down certain aspects of this policy. See \u201c- Fluctuating interest rates could adversely affect our profitability\u201d. It cannot be predicted whether these or other U.S. governmental actions will result in lasting improvement in financial and economic conditions affecting the U.S. banking industry and the U.S. economy. It also cannot be predicted whether and to what extent the efforts of the U.S. government to combat the mixed economic conditions will continue. If, notwithstanding the government\u2019s fiscal and monetary measures, the U.S. economy were to deteriorate, or its recovery were to slow, this would present significant challenges for the U.S. banking and financial services industry and for our Company.\nThe challenges to the level of economic activity in the U.S., and, therefore, to the banking industry, have also been exacerbated at times in recent years by extensive political disagreements regarding the statutory debt limit on U.S. federal government obligations and measures to address the substantial federal deficits. Following enactment of federal legislation in August 2011 which averted a default by the U.S. federal government on its sovereign obligations by raising the statutory debt limit and which established a process whereby cuts in federal spending may be accomplished, Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services (\u201cStandard & Poor\u2019s\u201d) lowered its long-term sovereign credit rating on the U.S. to \u201cAA+\u201d from \u201cAAA\u201d while affirming its highest rating on short-term U.S. obligations. Standard & Poor\u2019s also stated at the time that its outlook on the long-term rating remained negative; however, in June 2013, Standard & Poor\u2019s revised its outlook on the U.S. credit rating to stable from negative. At the present time, both Fitch Ratings and Moody\u2019s have reaffirmed the U.S.\u2019s \u201cAAA\u201d credit rating and have stated that their outlooks on the long-term ratings continue to be stable. In the fourth quarter of 2015, Republican Congressional leaders and the Administration reached an agreement to modestly increase federal spending over the next two years, reduce spending on some social programs, and to raise the federal borrowing limit. After further negotiations between the Congress and the Administration, the President signed into law a compromise spending measure generally consistent with the initial compromise agreement. There can be no assurance that the earlier political disagreements regarding the federal budget and the substantial federal deficits will not occur again in the future. Any such future disagreements, if not resolved, could result in further downgrades by the rating agencies with respect to the obligations of the U.S. federal government. Any such further downgrades could increase over time the U.S. federal government\u2019s cost of borrowing which may worsen its fiscal challenges, as well as generating upward pressure on interest rates generally in the U.S. which could, in turn, have adverse consequences for borrowers and the level of business activity.\nThe outcome and impact of these developments cannot be predicted with any certainty, but could have further adverse consequences for the credit ratings of U.S. debt and also present additional challenges for the U.S. economy and for the U.S. banking industry in general and for our business prospects as well. Any of the foregoing developments could generate further uncertainties and challenges for the U.S. economy which, in turn, could adversely affect the prospects of the banking industry in the U.S. and our business.\nTightening of credit markets and liquidity risk could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA tightening of the credit markets or any inability to obtain adequate funds at an acceptable cost for continued loan growth could adversely affect our asset growth and liquidity position and, therefore, our earnings capability. In addition to core deposit growth, maturity of investment securities, and loan payments, the Company also relies on wholesale funding sources including unsecured borrowing lines with correspondent banks, secured borrowing lines with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, public time certificates of deposits, and out-of-area and brokered time certificates of deposit. Our ability to access these funding sources could be impaired by deterioration in our financial condition as well as factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations for the financial services industry or serious dislocation in the general credit markets. In the event such disruption should occur, our ability to access these funding sources could be adversely affected, both as to price and availability, which would limit, or potentially raise the cost of, the funds available to the Company.\nThe FDIC has increased insurance premiums to rebuild and maintain the federal deposit insurance fund and there may be additional future premium increases and special assessments which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe Bank\u2019s deposits are insured under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, up to the maximum applicable limits, and are subject to deposit insurance assessments designed to tie what banks pay for deposit insurance more closely to the risks they pose. The Dodd-Frank Act broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity of a financial institution. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to increase the designated reserve ratio (the FDIC is required to set the reserve ratio each year) of the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15% to 1.35% of insured deposits; required that the fund meet that minimum ratio of insured deposits by 2020; and eliminated the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to insured depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation- Deposit Insurance\u201d in this Form 10-K.\nDespite the FDIC\u2019s actions to restore the deposit insurance fund, the fund may suffer additional losses in the future due to failures of insured institutions. There may be additional significant deposit insurance premium increases, special assessments or prepayments in order to restore the insurance fund\u2019s reserve ratio. Any significant premium increases or special assessments could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent levels of market volatility were unprecedented and we cannot predict whether they will return.\nFrom time-to-time since 2008, the capital and credit markets have experienced volatility and disruption at unprecedented levels. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers\u2019 underlying financial strength. If similar levels of market disruption and volatility return, we could experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access capital and funding and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and the effects of recent and pending federal legislation or of changes in, or supervisory enforcement of, banking or other laws and regulations could adversely affect us.\nAs discussed more fully in the section entitled \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in this Form 10-K, we are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities. In addition, as a publicly traded company, we are subject to regulation by the SEC. Any change in applicable regulations or federal, state or local legislation could have a substantial impact on us and our operations. Additional legislation and regulations that could significantly affect our powers, authority and operations may be enacted or adopted in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. New legislation and regulations are likely to increase the overall costs of regulatory compliance and, in many ways, have increased, or may increase in the future, the cost of doing business and present other challenges to the financial services industry.\nRegulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws or regulations by financial institutions and bank holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties. In recent years, these powers have been utilized more frequently due to the serious national, regional and local economic conditions we are facing. The exercise of regulatory authority may have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot accurately predict the ultimate effects of recent legislation or the various governmental, regulatory, monetary and fiscal initiatives which have been and may be enacted on the financial markets, on the Company and on the Bank. The terms and costs of these activities, or the failure of these actions to help stabilize the financial markets, asset prices, market liquidity and a continuation or worsening of current financial market and economic conditions, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.\nFluctuating interest rates could adversely affect our profitability.\nAs is the case with many banks, our profitability is dependent to a large extent upon our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and interest paid on deposits, borrowings, and other interest-bearing liabilities. Because of the differences in maturities and repricing characteristics of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Accordingly, fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect, and has in past years, impacted, our net interest margin, and, in turn, our profitability. This impact could result in a decrease in our interest income relative to interest expense. Increases in interest rates may also adversely impact the value of our securities investment portfolio. At December 31, 2015, our balance sheet was liability sensitive, and an increase in interest rates could cause our net interest margin and our net interest income to decline. Since the financial crisis of\n2008, the banking industry has operated in an extremely low interest rate environment relative to historical averages, and the Federal Reserve has pursued highly accommodative monetary policies (including a very low Federal funds rate and substantial purchases of long-term U.S. Treasury and agency securities) in an effort to facilitate growth in the U.S. economy and a reduction in levels of unemployment. This environment has placed downward pressure on the net interest margins of U.S. banks, including the Bank. In December 2015, the Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate from 1/4 to 1/2 percent. The Federal Reserve further indicated future policy actions to normalize interest rates will depend upon progress towards its objectives of maximum employment and two percent inflation, although the stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, and, even after employment and inflation are near its objectives, economic conditions may warrant for some time keeping the target federal funds rate below longer-term normal levels. The Federal Reserve also indicated that it intended to continue its policy of holding longer-term agency and Treasury securities at sizeable levels to help maintain accommodative financial conditions. The degree to which the Federal Reserve will continue its accommodative monetary policies, and the timing of any easing of those policies, will depend upon the Federal Reserve\u2019s judgments regarding labor market conditions and the overall economic outlook, and are, therefore, subject to continuing uncertainty.\nCompany Factors\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses, which could adversely affect our earnings.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses in an amount that we believe is adequate to provide for losses inherent in our loan portfolio. While we strive to carefully manage and monitor credit quality and to identify loans that may be deteriorating, at any time there are loans included in the portfolio that may result in losses, but that have not yet been identified as potential problem loans. Through established credit practices, we attempt to identify deteriorating loans and adjust the loan loss reserve accordingly. However, because future events are uncertain, there may be loans that deteriorate in an accelerated time frame. As a result, future additions to the allowance at elevated levels may be necessary. Because the loan portfolio contains a number of commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, deterioration in the credit quality of one or more of these loans may require a significant increase to the allowance for loan losses. Future additions to the allowance may also be required based on changes in the financial condition of borrowers, such as have resulted due to the current, and potentially worsening, economic conditions. Additionally, federal banking regulators, as an integral part of their supervisory function, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. These regulatory agencies may require us to recognize further loan loss provisions or charge-offs based upon their judgments, which may be different from ours. Any increase in the allowance for loan losses would have an adverse effect, which may be material, on our financial condition and results of operations.\nConcentration in real estate loans and further deterioration in the real estate markets we serve could require material increases in our allowance for loan losses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a high degree of concentration in loans secured by real estate (see Note 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K). Further deterioration in the local economies we serve could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations due to a weakening of our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay these loans, higher default rates, and a decline in the value of the collateral securing these loans. In light of the continuing effects of the economic downturn, real estate values have been adversely affected. As we have experienced, significant declines in real estate collateral can occur quite suddenly as new appraisals are performed in the normal course of monitoring the credit quality of the loan. Significant declines in the value of real estate collateral due to new appraisals can occur due to declines in the real estate market, changes in methodology applied by the appraiser, and/or using a different appraiser than was used for the prior appraisal. Our ability to recover on these loans by selling or disposing of the underlying real estate collateral is adversely impacted by declining real estate values which increases the likelihood we will suffer losses on defaulted loans secured by real estate beyond the amounts provided for in the allowance for loan losses. This, in turn, could require material increases in our allowance for loan losses and adversely affects our financial condition and results of operations, perhaps materially.\nWe have a significant concentration in loans to dental professionals, and loan concentrations within one industry may create additional risk.\nBank regulatory authorities and investors generally view significant loan concentrations within any particular industry as carrying higher inherent risk than a loan portfolio without any significant concentration in one industry. We have a significant concentration of loans to dental professionals which represented 24.19% in principal amount of our total loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 (see Note 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K). While we\napply credit practices which we believe to be prudent to these loans as well as all the other loans in our portfolio, due to our concentration in dental lending, we are exposed to the general risks of industry concentration, which include adverse market factors impacting that industry alone or disproportionately to other industries. In addition, bank regulatory authorities may in the future require us to limit additional lending in the dental industry if they have concerns that our concentration in that industry creates significant risks, which in turn could limit our ability to pursue new loans in an area where we believe we currently have a competitive advantage.\nNonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2015, our nonperforming loans (which include all nonaccrual loans, net of government guarantees) were 0.19% of the loan portfolio. At December 31, 2015, our nonperforming assets (which include foreclosed real estate) were 0.76% of total assets. Nonperforming loans and assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. Until economic and market conditions improve, we expect to continue to incur losses relating to nonperforming assets. We generally do not record interest income on nonperforming loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting our income and increasing our loan administration costs. When we take collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, we are required to mark the related asset to the then fair market value of the collateral, less estimated selling expenses, which may ultimately result in a loss. An increase in the level of nonperforming assets increases our risk profile and may impact the capital levels our regulators believe are appropriate in light of the ensuing risk profile. While we reduce problem assets through loan sales, workouts, and restructurings and otherwise, decreases in the value of the underlying collateral, or in these borrowers\u2019 performance or financial condition, whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond our control, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, perhaps materially. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time from management and our directors which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. Any significant future increase in nonperforming assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not have the ability to continue paying dividends on our common stock at current or historic levels.\nOn January 20, 2016, we announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.11 per share, payable to shareholders on February 16, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company paid $0.42 per share in dividends and has historically declared dividends quarterly. Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock depends on a variety of factors. It is possible in the future that we may not be able to continue paying quarterly dividends commensurate with historic levels, if at all. As a holding company, a substantial portion of our cash flow typically comes from dividends our bank subsidiary pays to us. Cash dividends will depend on sufficient earnings to support them and adherence to bank regulatory requirements. If the Bank is not able to pay dividends to the Company, the Company may not be able to pay dividends on its common stock. Consequently, the inability to receive dividends from the Bank could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nChanges in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated financial statements or new interpretations of existing standards emerge as standard industry practice. These changes can be very difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements.\nWe may be required, in the future, to recognize impairment with respect to investment securities, including the FHLB stock we hold.\nOur securities portfolio contains whole loan private mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities and currently includes securities with unrecognized losses. We may continue to observe volatility in the fair market value of these securities. We evaluate the securities portfolio for any other than temporary impairment (\u201cOTTI\u201d) each reporting period, as required by GAAP. Future evaluations of the securities portfolio could require us to recognize impairment charges. The credit quality of securities issued by certain municipalities has deteriorated in recent quarters. Although management does not believe the credit quality of the Company\u2019s municipal securities has similarly deteriorated, such deterioration could occur in the future. For example, it is possible that government-sponsored programs to allow mortgages to be refinanced to lower rates could materially adversely impact the yield on our portfolio of mortgage-backed securities, since a significant portion of our investment portfolio is composed of such securities.\nIn addition, as a condition to membership in the FHLB, we are required to purchase and hold a certain amount of FHLB stock. Our stock purchase requirement is based, in part, upon the outstanding principal balance of advances from the FHLB. At December 31, 2015, we had stock in the FHLB totaling $5,208. The FHLB stock held by us is carried at cost and is subject to recoverability testing under applicable accounting standards. As of December 31, 2015, we did not recognize an impairment charge related to our FHLB stock holdings. Future negative changes to the financial condition of the FHLB could require us to recognize an impairment charge with respect to such holdings.\nIf the goodwill we have recorded in connection with acquisitions becomes impaired, it could have an adverse impact on our reported earnings.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $39,255 of goodwill on our balance sheet. In accordance with GAAP, our goodwill is not amortized but rather evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists. Such evaluation is based on a variety of qualitative and quantitative factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance, and other relevant entity-specific events. The last impairment test was performed at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, we did not recognize an impairment charge related to our goodwill. Future evaluations of goodwill may result in findings of impairment and write-downs, which would impact our operating results and could be material.\nWe face strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer financial services.\nOur three major markets are in Oregon and Washington. The banking and financial services businesses in our market area are highly competitive, and increased competition may adversely impact the level of our loans and deposits. Ultimately, we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. These competitors include national banks, foreign banks, regional banks and other community banks. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loan associations, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries. In particular, our competitors include major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns. Areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits, efforts to obtain loan and deposit customers and a range in quality of products and services provided, including new technology-driven products and services. We have also seen an increase in competition relative to our national dental lending program. If we are unable to attract and retain banking customers, we may be unable to develop loan growth or maintain our current level of deposits, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure in our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third-parties, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our businesses, result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause financial losses.\nWe are dependent on third-parties and their ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions, many of which are highly complex, across numerous and diverse markets. These transactions, as well as the information technology services we provide to clients, often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory standards. Due to the breadth of our client base and our geographical reach, developing and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure is challenging, particularly as a result of rapidly evolving legal and regulatory requirements and technological shifts. Our financial, accounting, data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as electrical, internet or telecommunications outages, a spike in transaction volume, a cybersecurity attack or other unforeseen catastrophic events, which may adversely affect our ability to process these transactions or provide services.\nIn addition, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage, transmission and reporting of personal, confidential and other sensitive information or data on our computer systems, networks and business applications. Although we take numerous protective measures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our and our clients\u2019 information across all geographic and product lines, and endeavor to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, the nature of the threats continues to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cybersecurity attacks and other events that could have an adverse security\nimpact and significant negative consequences to us. Despite the defensive measures we take to manage our internal technological and operational infrastructure, these threats may originate externally from third-parties, such as foreign governments, organized crime and other hackers, and outsource or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or the threats may originate from within our organization. These events could result in litigation or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered by insurance, regulatory consequences or reputational harm, any of which could harm our competitive position, operating results and financial condition. These types of incidents can remain undetected for extended periods of time, thereby increasing the associated risks. We may also be required to expend significant resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or exposures arising from cybersecurity risks.\nWe also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third-parties that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems, data or infrastructure. In addition, as interconnectivity with our clients grows, we increasingly face the risk of operational failure with respect to our clients\u2019 systems.\nOther financial institutions have been the target of various denial-of-service or other cyberattacks as part of what appears to be a coordinated effort to disrupt the operations of financial institutions and potentially test their cybersecurity in advance of future and more advanced cyberattacks. These denial-of-service attacks require substantial resources to defend, and may affect customer satisfaction and behavior. In addition, there have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties to breach data security at financial institutions as well as the other types of companies, such as large retailers, or with respect to financial transactions, including through the use of social engineering schemes such as \u201cphishing\u201d. The ability of our customers to bank remotely, including online and through mobile devices, requires secure transmissions of confidential information and increase the risk of data security breaches which would expose us to financial claims by customers or others and which could adversely affect our reputation. Even if cyberattacks and similar tactics are not directed specifically at the Bank, such attacks on other large financial institutions could disrupt the overall functioning of the financial systems and undermine consumer confidence in banks generally, to the detriment of other financial institutions, including the Bank.\nIn March of 2015, the Federal bank regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution\u2019s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution\u2019s operations after a cyberattack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes that enable recovery of data and business operations and that address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyberattack. Although these regulatory statements state that they do not contain any new regulatory expectations, we are continuing to evaluate them, as they do indicate that the regulators regard cybersecurity to be a matter of great importance for U.S. financial institutions. A financial institution which fails to observe the regulatory guidance could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial sanctions.\nIn July of 2015, the Federal bank regulators announced the issuance of a cybersecurity assessment tool, the output of which can assist a financial institution\u2019s senior management and board of directors in assessing the institution\u2019s cybersecurity risk and preparedness. The first part of the assessment tool is the inherent risk profile, which aims to assist management in determining an institution\u2019s level of cybersecurity risk. The second part of the assessment tool is cybersecurity maturity, which is designed to help management assess whether their controls provide the desired level of preparedness. The Federal bank regulators plan to utilize the assessment tool as part of their examination process when evaluating financial institutions\u2019 cybersecurity preparedness in information technology and safety and soundness examinations and inspections. Failure to effectively utilize this tool could result in regulatory criticism. Significant resources may be required to adequately implement the tool and address any assessment concerns regarding preparedness. We are evaluating the impact of this assessment tool.\nTo date we have not experienced any material losses relating to a cybersecurity incident or other information security breaches, but there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses or information security breaches in the future. If one or more of these events occurs, it could potentially jeopardize the confidential, proprietary and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, as well as our clients\u2019 or other third-parties\u2019, operations which could result in damage to our reputation, substantial costs, regulatory penalties and/or client dissatisfaction or loss. Potential costs of a cybersecurity incident may include, but would not be limited to, remediation costs, increased protection costs, lost revenue from the unauthorized use of proprietary information or the loss of current and/or future customers, and litigation.\nWe maintain an insurance policy which we believe provides sufficient coverage at a manageable expense for an institution of our size and scope with similar technological systems. However, we cannot assure that this policy would be sufficient to cover all financial losses, damages, penalties, including lost revenues, should we experience any one or more of our or a third-party\u2019s systems failing or experiencing attack.\nOur business and financial results could be impacted materially by adverse results in legal or regulatory proceedings.\nAs is the case with other banking institutions, we are from time to time subject to claims and proceedings related to our present or previous operations. In addition, we may be the subject of governmental investigations and other forms of regulatory inquiry from time to time. The results of these legal proceedings and governmental investigations and inquiries could lead to significant monetary damages or penalties, restrictions on the way in which we conduct our business, or reputational harm, and could involve significant defense or other costs. Although we establish accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, we do not have accruals for all legal proceedings where we face a risk of loss. In addition, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to us from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, our ultimate losses may be higher or lower, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies. To mitigate the cost of some of these claims, we maintain insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations. However, our insurance coverage does not cover any civil money penalties or fines imposed by government authorities and may not cover all other claims that have been or might be brought against us, or continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost. As a result, we may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks associated with potential acquisitions and expansion activities or divestitures may disrupt our business and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe regularly evaluate potential acquisitions and expansion opportunities. We have in the past, and may in the future, seek to expand our business by acquiring other businesses which we believe will enhance our business. We cannot predict the frequency, size or timing of our acquisitions, as this will depend on the availability of prospective target opportunities at valuation levels we find attractive and the competition for such opportunities from other parties. There can be no assurance that our acquisitions will have the anticipated positive results, including results related to: the total cost of integration; the retention of key personnel; the time required to complete the integration; the amount of longer-term cost savings; continued growth; or the overall performance of the acquired company or combined entity. We also may encounter difficulties in obtaining required regulatory approvals and unexpected contingent liabilities can arise from the businesses we acquire. Further, the asset quality or other financial characteristics of a business or assets we may acquire may deteriorate after an acquisition agreement is signed or after an acquisition closes, which could result in impairment or other expenses and charges which would reduce our operating results. Integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly. If we are not able to integrate successfully past or future acquisitions, there is a risk that results of operations could be adversely affected. To the extent that we grow through acquisitions, there is a risk that we will not be able to adequately or profitably manage this growth. In addition, we may sell or restructure portions of our business. Any divestitures or restructuring may result in significant expenses and write-offs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and may involve additional risks, including difficulties in obtaining any required regulatory approvals, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees. We may not be successful in addressing these or any other significant risks encountered in connection with any acquisition or divestitures we might make.\nWe may pursue additional capital in the future, which could dilute the holders of our outstanding common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFrom time to time, particularly in the current uncertain economic environment, we may consider alternatives for raising capital when opportunities present themselves, in order to further strengthen our capital and/or better position ourselves to take advantage of identified or potential opportunities that may arise in the future. Such alternatives may include issuance and sale of common or preferred stock, or borrowings by the Company, with proceeds contributed to the Bank. Any such capital raising alternatives could dilute the holders of our outstanding common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws and Oregon law could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us (even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders) and for holders of our common stock to receive any related takeover premium for their common stock. We are also subject to certain provisions of Oregon law that could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of us. These provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 88367, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PCBK"}
