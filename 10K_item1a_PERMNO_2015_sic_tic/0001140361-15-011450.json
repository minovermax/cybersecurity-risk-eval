Some of these risks are described below, and readers of this Annual Report on Form 10-K should take such risks into account in evaluating our Company or making any decision to invest in us. This section does not describe all risks applicable to our Company, our industry or our business, and it is intended only as a summary of material factors affecting our business.\nRisks related to our business and operations\nHealthcare reform legislation may affect our business.\nIn recent years, many legislative proposals have been introduced or proposed in Congress and in some state legislatures that would affect major changes in the healthcare system, either nationally or at the state level. At the federal level, Congress has continued to propose or consider healthcare budgets that substantially reduce payments under the Medicare programs. See \u201cBusiness- Sources of Revenue\u201d in Item 1 for more information. The ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation and the impact of potential legislation on us is uncertain and difficult, if not impossible, to predict. That impact may be material to our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation.\nThe healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to:\n\u2022 facility and professional licensure/permits, including certificates of need;\n\u2022 conduct of operations, including financial relationships among healthcare providers, Medicare fraud and abuse, and physician self-referral;\n\u2022 addition of facilities and services; and\n\u2022 billing and payment for services.\nIn recent years, there have been heightened coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts by both federal and state government agencies relating to the healthcare industry. We believe we are in substantial compliance with all laws, but differing interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our methods of operations, facilities, equipment, personnel, services and capital expenditure programs and increase our operating expenses. If we fail to comply with these extensive laws and government regulations, we could become ineligible to receive government program reimbursement, suffer civil or criminal penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations. In addition, we could be forced to expend considerable resources responding to an investigation or other enforcement action under these laws or regulations. For a more complete description of certain of these laws and regulations, see \u201cBusiness-Regulation and Healthcare Reform\u201d in Item 1.\nThe healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to (1) facility and professional licensure, including certificates of need, (2) conduct of operations, including financial relationships among healthcare providers, Medicare fraud and abuse and physician self-referral, (3) addition of facilities and services and enrollment of newly developed facilities in the Medicare program, (4) payment for services and (5) safeguarding protected health information.\nBoth federal and state regulatory agencies inspect, survey and audit our facilities to review our compliance with these laws and regulations. While our facilities intend to comply with the existing licensing, Medicare certification requirements and accreditation standards, there can be no assurance that these regulatory authorities will determine that all applicable requirements are fully met at any given time. A determination by any of these regulatory authorities that a facility is not in compliance with these requirements could lead to the imposition of requirements that the facility takes corrective action, assessment of fines and penalties, or loss of licensure or Medicare certification of accreditation. These consequences could have an adverse effect on our Company.\nDecreases in Medicare reimbursement rates, implementation of annual caps, and payment reductions applied to the second and subsequent therapy services will adversely affect our financial results.\nThe Medicare program reimburses outpatient rehabilitation providers based on the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (\u201cMPFS\u201d). The MPFS rates are automatically updated annually based on a formula, called the sustainable growth rate (\u201cSGR\u201d) formula. The use of the SGR formula would have resulted in calculated automatic reductions in rates in every year since 2002; however, for each year through June 30, 2014, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) or Congress has taken action to prevent the implementation of SGR formula reductions. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 froze the Medicare physician fee schedule rates at 2013 levels through June 30, 2014, averting a scheduled 20.1% cut in the MPFS as a result of the SGR formula that would have taken effect on January 1, 2014. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 temporarily blocks this reduction through March 31, 2015 and replaces it with a 0.5% payment increase for services provided through December 31, 2014. In October 2014, CMS released the Medicare physician fee schedule rates for 2015, which included a 1% payment increase for physical therapy services. Automatic reductions in the Medicare physician fee schedule payment rates will commence on April 1, 2015, unless Congress again takes legislative action to prevent the SGR formula reductions from going into effect.\nThe Budget Control Act of 2011 increased the federal debt ceiling in connection with deficit reductions over the next ten years, and requires automatic reductions in federal spending by approximately $1.2 trillion. Payments to Medicare providers are subject to these automatic spending reductions, subject to a 2% cap. On April 1, 2013, a 2% reduction to Medicare payments was implemented.\nAs a result of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, the formula for determining the total amount paid by Medicare in any one year for outpatient physical therapy, occupational therapy, and/or speech-language pathology services provided to any Medicare beneficiary (i.e., the \u201cTherapy Cap\u201d or \u201cLimit\u201d) was established. Based on the statutory definitions which constrained how the Therapy Cap would be applied, there is one Limit for Physical Therapy and Speech Language Pathology Services combined, and one Limit for Occupational Therapy. During 2014, the annual Limit on outpatient therapy services was $1,920 for Physical and Speech Language Pathology Services combined and $1,920 for Occupational Therapy Services. Since January 1, 2015, the annual Limit on outpatient therapy services is $1,940 for Physical and Speech Language Pathology Services combined and $1,940 for Occupational Therapy Services. Historically, these Therapy Caps applied to outpatient therapy services provided in all settings, except for services provided in departments of hospitals. However, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, and prior legislation, extended the annual limits on therapy expenses and the manual medical review thresholds to services furnished in hospital outpatient department settings through March 31, 2015. The application of annual limits will no longer apply to hospital outpatient department settings commencing as of March 31, 2015 unless Congress extends it.\nIn the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, Congress implemented an exceptions process to the annual Limit for therapy expenses for therapy services above the annual Limit. Therapy services above the annual Limit that are medically necessary satisfy an exception to the annual Limit and such claims are payable by the Medicare program. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 extended the exceptions process for outpatient therapy caps through March 31, 2015. Unless Congress extends the exceptions process further, the therapy caps will apply to all outpatient therapy services beginning April 1, 2015, except those services furnished and billed by outpatient hospital departments. For any claim above the annual Limit, the claim must contain a modifier indicating that the services are medically necessary and justified by appropriate documentation in the medical record.\nFurthermore, under the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (\u201cMCTRA\u201d), since October 1, 2012, patients who met or exceeded $3,700 in therapy expenditures during a calendar year have been subject to a manual medical review to determine whether applicable payment criteria are satisfied. The $3,700 threshold is applied to Physical Therapy and Speech Language Pathology Services; a separate $3,700 threshold is applied to the Occupational Therapy. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 extended through March 31, 2015 the requirement that Medicare perform manual medical review of therapy services beyond the $3,700 threshold.\nCMS adopted a multiple procedure payment reduction (\u201cMPPR\u201d) for therapy services in the final update to the MPFS for calendar year 2011. During 2011, the MPPR applied to all outpatient therapy services paid under Medicare Part B - occupational therapy, physical therapy and speech-language pathology. Under the policy, the Medicare program pays 100% of the practice expense component of the Relative Value Unit (\u201cRVU\u201d) for the therapy procedure with the highest practice expense RVU, then reduces the payment for the practice expense component for the second and subsequent therapy procedures or units of service furnished during the same day for the same patient, regardless of whether those therapy services are furnished in separate sessions. In 2011 and 2012, the practice expense component for the second and subsequent therapy service furnished during the same day for the same patient was reduced by 20% in office and other non-institutional settings and by 25% in institutional settings. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 increased the payment reduction of the practice expense component to 50%, on subsequent therapy procedures in either setting, effective April 1, 2013. In addition, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 (\u201cMCTRA\u201d) directed CMS to implement a claims-based data collection program to gather additional data on patient function during the course of therapy in order to better understand patient conditions and outcomes. All practice settings that provide outpatient therapy services are required to include this data on the claim form. Since July 1, 2013, therapists have been required to report new codes and modifiers on the claim form that reflect a patient\u2019s functional limitations and goals at initial evaluation, periodically throughout care, and at discharge. Since July 1, 2013, CMS has rejected claims if the required data is not included in the claim.\nThe Physician Quality Reporting System, or \"PQRS,\" is a CMS reporting program that uses a combination of incentive payments and payment reductions to promote reporting of quality information by \"eligible professionals.\" Although physical therapists, occupational therapists and qualified speech-language therapists are generally able to participate in the PQRS program, therapy professionals for whose services we bill through our rehab agencies cannot participate because the Medicare claims processing systems currently cannot accommodate institutional providers such as rehab agencies. Eligible professionals, such as those of our therapy professionals for whose services we bill using their individual Medicare provider numbers, who do not satisfactorily report data on quality measures will be subject to a 2% reduction in their Medicare payment in 2016 and 2017.\nStatutes, regulations, and payment rules governing the delivery of therapy services to Medicare beneficiaries are complex and subject to interpretation. The Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations and is not aware of any pending or threatened investigations involving allegations of potential wrongdoing that would have a material effect on our financial statements as of December 31, 2014. Compliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to future government review and interpretation, as well as significant regulatory action including fines, penalties, and exclusion from the Medicare program.\nAs a result of increased post-payment reviews of claims we submit to Medicare for our services, we may incur additional costs and may be required to repay amounts already paid to us.\nWe are subject to regular post-payment inquiries, investigations and audits of the claims we submit to Medicare for payment for our services. These post-payment reviews are increasing as a result of new government cost-containment initiatives. These additional post-payment reviews may require us to incur additional costs to respond to requests for records and to pursue the reversal of payment denials, and ultimately may require us to refund amounts paid to us by Medicare that are determined to have been overpaid.\nFor a further description of this and other laws and regulations involving governmental reimbursements, see \u201cBusiness-Sources of Revenue\u201d and \u201c-Regulation and Healthcare Reform\u201d in Item 1.\nIf we fail to effectively and timely transition to the ICD-10 coding system, our operations could be adversely affected.\nHealth plans and providers are required to transition to the new ICD-10 coding system, which greatly expands the number and detail of billing codes used for third-party claims. Use of the ICD-10 system is required beginning October 1, 2015. Transition to the new ICD-10 system requires significant investment in coding technology and software as well as the training of staff involved in the coding and billing process. In addition to these upfront costs of transition to ICD-10, it is possible that we could experience disruption or delays in payment due to technical or coding errors or other implementation issues involving our systems or the systems and implementation efforts of health plans and their business partners.\nAn economic downturn, state budget pressures, sustained unemployment and continued deficit spending by the federal government may result in a reduction in reimbursement and covered services.\nAn economic downturn could have a detrimental effect on our revenues. Historically, state budget pressures have translated into reductions in state spending. Given that Medicaid outlays are a significant component of state budgets, we can expect continuing cost containment pressures on Medicaid outlays for our services in the states in which we operate. In addition, an economic downturn, coupled with sustained unemployment, may also impact the number of enrollees in managed care programs as well as the profitability of managed care companies, which could result in reduced reimbursement rates.\nThe existing federal deficit, as well as deficit spending by federal and state governments as the result of adverse developments in the economy or other reasons, can lead to continuing pressure to reduce governmental expenditures for other purposes, including government-funded programs in which we participate, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Such actions in turn may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe depend upon reimbursement by third-party payors.\nSubstantially all of our revenues are derived from private and governmental third-party payors. In 2014, approximately 76.6% of our revenues were derived collectively from managed care plans, commercial health insurers, workers\u2019 compensation payors, and other private pay revenue sources and approximately 23.4% of our revenues were derived from Medicare and Medicaid. Initiatives undertaken by industry and government to contain healthcare costs affect the profitability of our clinics. These payors attempt to control healthcare costs by contracting with healthcare providers to obtain services on a discounted basis. We believe that this trend will continue and may limit reimbursement for healthcare services. If insurers or managed care companies from whom we receive substantial payments were to reduce the amounts they pay for services, our profit margins may decline, or we may lose patients if we choose not to renew our contracts with these insurers at lower rates. In addition, in certain geographical areas, our clinics must be approved as providers by key health maintenance organizations and preferred provider plans. Failure to obtain or maintain these approvals would adversely affect our financial results.\nIn recent years, through legislative and regulatory actions, the federal government has made substantial changes to various payment systems under the Medicare program. See \u201cBusiness- Sources of Revenue\u201d in Item 1 for more information. President Obama signed into law comprehensive reforms to the healthcare system, including changes to Medicare reimbursement. Additional reforms or other changes to these payment systems may be proposed or adopted, either by the U.S. Congress or by CMS, including bundled payments, outcomes-based payment methodologies and a shift away from traditional fee-for-service reimbursement. If revised regulations are adopted, the availability, methods and rates of Medicare reimbursements for services of the type furnished at our facilities could change. Some of these changes and proposed changes could adversely affect our business strategy, operations and financial results.\nWe face inspections, reviews, audits and investigations under federal and state government programs and contracts. These audits could have adverse findings that may negatively affect our business.\nAs a result of our participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, we are subject to various governmental inspections, reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with these programs and applicable laws and regulations. Managed care payors may also reserve the right to conduct audits. An adverse inspection, review, audit or investigation could result in:\n\u00b7\nrefunding amounts we have been paid pursuant to the Medicare or Medicaid programs or from managed care payors;\n\u00b7\nstate or federal agencies imposing fines, penalties and other sanctions on us;\n\u00b7\ntemporary suspension of payment for new patients to the facility or agency;\n\u00b7\ndecertification or exclusion from participation in the Medicare or Medicaid programs or one or more managed care payor networks;\n\u00b7\nimposition of a corporate integrity agreement;\n\u00b7\ndamage to our reputation;\n\u00b7\nthe revocation of a facility's or agency's license; and\n\u00b7\nloss of certain rights under, or termination of, our contracts with managed care payors.\nIf adverse inspections, reviews, audits or investigations occur and any of the results noted above occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nOur facilities are subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations relating to the privacy of individually identifiable information.\nHIPAA required the HHS to adopt standards to protect the privacy and security of individually identifiable health-related information. The department released final regulations containing privacy standards in December 2000 and published revisions to the final regulations in August 2002. The privacy regulations extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health-related information. The regulations also provide patients with significant rights related to understanding and controlling how their health information is used or disclosed. The security regulations require healthcare providers to implement administrative, physical and technical practices to protect the security of individually identifiable health information that is maintained or transmitted electronically. HITECH, which was signed into law in February of 2009, enhanced the privacy, security and enforcement provisions of HIPAA by, among other things establishing security breach notification requirements, allowing enforcement of HIPAA by state attorneys general, and increasing penalties for HIPAA violations. Violations of HIPAA or HITECH could result in civil or criminal penalties.\nIn addition to HIPAA, there are numerous federal and state laws and regulations addressing patient and consumer privacy concerns, including unauthorized access or theft of personal information. State statutes and regulations vary from state to state. Lawsuits, including class actions and action by state attorneys general, directed at companies that have experienced a privacy or security breach also can occur.\nThe Company and its clinics have established policies and procedures in an effort to ensure compliance with these privacy related requirements. However, if there is a breach, we may be subject to various penalties and damages and may be required to incur costs to mitigate the impact of the breach on affected individuals.\nWe may be adversely affected by a cyber attack that could compromise our information technologies, which may cause a violation of HIPAA or HITECH.\nIn the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive patient information including patient demographic data, eligibility for various medical plans including Medicare and Medicaid and protected health information, which is subject to HIPAA and HITECH. We maintain our information technology systems with safeguards protecting against cyber-attacks, including passive intrusion protection, firewalls and virus detection software. However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant cyber attack could not occur. A cyber attack that bypasses our information technology security systems could cause the loss of protected health information, or other data subject to privacy laws, the loss of proprietary business information, or a material disruption to our information technology business systems resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, our future results could be adversely affected due to the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of protected health information, other confidential data or proprietary business information, operational or business delays resulting from the disruption of information technology systems and subsequent clean-up and mitigation activities, negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with clients, members, or industry peers, or regulatory action taken as a result of such incident.\nWe depend upon the cultivation and maintenance of relationships with the physicians in our markets.\nOur success is dependent upon referrals from physicians in the communities our clinics serve and our ability to maintain good relations with these physicians and other referral sources. Physicians referring patients to our clinics are free to refer their patients to other therapy providers or to their own physician owned therapy practice. If we are unable to successfully cultivate and maintain strong relationships with physicians and other referral sources, our business may decrease and our net operating revenues may decline.\nWe depend upon our ability to recruit and retain experienced physical therapists.\nOur revenue generation is dependent upon referrals from physicians in the communities our clinics serve, and our ability to maintain good relations with these physicians. Our therapists are the front line for generating these referrals and we are dependent on their talents and skills to successfully cultivate and maintain strong relationships with these physicians. If we cannot recruit and retain our base of experienced and clinically skilled therapists, our business may decrease and our net operating revenues may decline. Periodically, we have clinics in isolated communities that are temporarily unable to operate due to the unavailability of a therapist who satisfies our standards.\nOur revenues may fluctuate due to weather.\nWe have a significant number of clinics in states that normally experience snow and ice during the winter months. Also, a significant number of our clinics are located in states along the Gulf Coast and Atlantic Coast which are subject to periodic winter storms, hurricanes and other severe storm systems. Periods of severe weather may cause physical damage to our facilities or prevent our staff or patients from traveling to our clinics, which may cause a decrease in our net operating revenues.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nWe encounter competition from local, regional or national entities, some of which have superior resources or other competitive advantages. Intense competition may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. For a more complete description of this competitive environment, see \u201cBusiness-Competition\u201d in Item 1. An adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations may require us to write-down goodwill.\nWe may incur closure costs and losses.\nThe competitive, economic or reimbursement conditions in our markets in which we operate may require us to reorganize or to close certain clinics. In the event a clinic is reorganized or closed, we may incur losses and closure costs. The closure costs and losses may include, but are not limited to, lease obligations, severance, and write-down or write-off of goodwill and other intangible assets.\nFuture acquisitions may use significant resources, may be unsuccessful and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to continue pursuing acquisitions of outpatient physical therapy clinics. Acquisitions may involve significant cash expenditures, potential debt incurrence and operational losses, dilutive issuances of equity securities and expenses that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022 the difficulty and expense of integrating acquired personnel into our business;\n\u2022 the diversion of management\u2019s time from existing operations;\n\u2022 the potential loss of key employees of acquired companies;\n\u2022 the difficulty of assignment and/or procurement of managed care contractual arrangements; and\n\u2022 the assumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies, including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare regulations.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining financing for acquisitions at a reasonable cost, or such financing may contain restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility. We also may be unable to acquire outpatient physical therapy clinics or successfully operate such clinics following the acquisition.\nCertain of our internal controls, particularly as they relate to billings and cash collections, are largely decentralized at our clinic locations.\nOur clinic operations are largely decentralized and certain of our internal controls, particularly the processing of billings and cash collections, occur at the clinic level. Taken as a whole, we believe our internal controls for these functions at our clinics are adequate. Our controls for billing and cash collections largely depend on compliance with our written policies and procedures and separation of functions among clinic personnel. We also maintain corporate level controls, including an audit compliance program, that are intended to mitigate and detect any potential deficiencies in internal controls at the clinic level. The effectiveness of these controls to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the level of compliance with our policies and procedures deteriorates. If our controls fail, it would likely have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms. If we are unable to do so, we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIn addition, we conduct our operations through our subsidiaries. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. We may find it necessary or prudent to refinance our outstanding indebtedness with longer-maturity debt at a higher interest rate. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all, is directly affected by the current global economic and financial conditions. In addition, our ability to incur secured indebtedness (which would generally enable us to achieve better pricing than the incurrence of unsecured indebtedness) depends in part on the value of our assets, which depends, in turn, on the strength of our cash flows and results of operations, and on economic and market conditions and other factors.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations or we are unable to refinance our indebtedness, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions, or the proceeds from the dispositions may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nOur Credit Agreement contains restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur Credit Agreement contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock or make other restricted payments; make certain investments; sell or transfer assets; create liens; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nUnder our Credit Agreement, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance we will continue to meet those ratios. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our Credit Agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Agreement, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit.\nRisks Relating to Our Outstanding Common Stock\nOur stock price could be volatile, which could cause you to lose part or all of your investment.\nThe stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In particular, the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile. During 2014, our stock price ranged from a low of $29.56 per share (on May 8, 2014) to a high of $44.00 per share (on October 31, 2014). Factors, such as announcements concerning acquisitions, changes in revenues and earnings expectations, regulatory conditions, including federal and state regulations, and economic and other external factors, as well as period-to-period fluctuations and financial results, may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock.\nFrom time to time, there has been limited trading volume in our common stock. In addition, there can be no assurance that there will continue to be a trading market or that any securities research analysts will continue to provide research coverage with respect to our common stock. It is possible that such factors will adversely affect the market for our common stock.\nIssuance of shares in connection with financing transactions or under stock incentive plans will dilute current stockholders.\nPursuant to our stock incentive plans, our Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, consisting solely of independent directors, is authorized to grant stock awards to our employees, directors and consultants. Shareholders will incur dilution upon the exercise of any outstanding stock awards or the grant of any restricted stock. In addition, if we raise additional funds by issuing additional common stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common stock, further dilution to our existing stockholders will result, and new investors could have rights superior to existing stockholders.\nThe number of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our stock.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had reserved approximately 700 shares of common stock for issuance under outstanding options and 497,000 shares for future equity grants. These shares of common stock are registered for sale or resale on currently effective registration statements and have been approved by stockholders. We may issue additional restricted securities or register additional shares of common stock under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) in the future. The issuance of a significant number of shares of common stock upon the exercise of stock options or the availability for sale, or sale, of a substantial number of the shares of common stock eligible for future sale under effective registration statements, under Rule 144 or otherwise, could adversely affect the market price of the common stock.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if that change would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws may delay, discourage, prevent or render more difficult an attempt to obtain control of our company, whether through a tender offer, business combination, proxy contest or otherwise. These provisions include the charter authorization of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock and a restriction on the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting.", "PERMNO": 77629, "SIC": 8000, "TIC": "USPH"}
