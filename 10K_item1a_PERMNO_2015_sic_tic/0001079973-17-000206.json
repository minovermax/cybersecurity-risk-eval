{"cik": "1167419", "company": "Bioptix, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. - RISK FACTORS\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, they could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may not be successful in the pursuit of a strategic alternative.\nFollowing the January 2017 decision to exit the BDI business, the Company has turned its attention to an evaluation of other strategic alternatives available to us. As of February 28, 2017 we have approximately $11,500,000 in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, and we hope to maintain our NASDAQ Capital Market listing as described below under \"Risks Related to our Securities.\" We may not be successful in identifying and successfully negotiating a transaction with another target company, as merger and acquisition transactions are highly uncertain of success, or obtaining shareholder approval of any such transaction. If we are not able to identify, negotiate and consummate a transaction with another company, we will be unable to continue our business and may need to dissolve.\nWe may not be successful in disposing of the BDI business under acceptable terms and on a basis that does not involve liability settlements or other contingencies.\nFollowing the January 2017 decision to exit the BDI business we are evaluating possible options to sell or license the assets, operations or stock of BDI. If we are not able to reach an agreement under acceptable terms for the disposal, we may face additional costs for and creditor complaints that would need to be dealt with and could entail additional expenses and management time.\nWe have a history of operating losses, and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe were a diagnostics company and are now a research tools company with a limited operating history. We are not profitable and have incurred losses since our inception. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash received from sales of our products, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs through the first quarter of 2018, subject to any possible strategic transactions.\nWe expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future, and these losses will likely increase as we continue to develop and commercialize our products and product candidates. If our products fail in development, or if our products do not achieve market acceptance, we may never become profitable. Even if we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. We anticipate that, if needed, we will seek capital from other sources, such as equity offerings, at some point in the future. However, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining such additional financing on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. In addition, any sale of a substantial number of additional shares may cause dilution to our existing shareholders and could also cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nRisks Related to our Securities\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market and we need to maintain the requisite qualitative and quantitative requirements for continued listing.\nIn the past, the trading price of our common stock, did not meet the $1.00 minimum bid price required by the NASDAQ Capital Market pursuant to NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5550(a)(2), and we needed to effect a reverse stock split to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. If the trading price of our common stock falls below the $1.00 minimum bid requirement, or other changes cause us to lose our listing, that could result in negative consequences, such as a limited availability of market quotations for our common stock, a determination that the common stock is a \"penny stock\" which would require brokers trading in the common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for the common stock, a limited amount of analyst coverage and a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future and, as a result, our investors' sole source of gain, if any, will depend on capital appreciation, if any.\nThe Company does not intend to declare any dividends on our shares of common stock in the foreseeable future and currently intends to retain any future earnings for funding growth. As a result, investors should not rely on an investment in our securities if they require the investment to produce dividend income. Capital appreciation, if any, of our shares may be investors' sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Moreover, investors may not be able to resell their shares of our common stock at or above the price they paid for them.\nOur stock price is volatile.\nOur common stock is currently traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market. The trading price of our common stock from time to time has fluctuated widely and may be subject to similar volatility, in the future. For example in the calendar year 2016, our trading price has ranged from $1.62 to $4.54, and in the year ended December 31, 2015, our common stock traded as low as $2.12 and as high as $16.32. The trading price of our common stock in the future may be affected by a number of factors, including events described in these \"Risk Factors.\" In recent years, broad stock market indices, in general, and smaller capitalization companies, in particular, have experienced substantial price fluctuations. In a volatile market, we may experience wide fluctuations in the market price of our common stock. These fluctuations may have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs, potential liabilities and the diversion of management's attention and resources, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nAs a public company we are subject to complex legal and accounting requirements that require us to incur substantial expenses, and our financial controls and procedures may not be sufficient to ensure timely and reliable reporting of financial information, which, as a public company, could materially harm our stock price and listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nAs a public company, we are subject to numerous legal and accounting requirements that do not apply to private companies. The cost of compliance with many of these requirements is substantial, not only in absolute terms but, more importantly, in relation to the overall scope of the operations of a small company. Failure to comply with these requirements can have numerous adverse consequences including, but not limited to, our inability to file required periodic reports on a timely basis, loss of market confidence, delisting of our securities and/or governmental or private actions against us. We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all of these requirements or that the cost of such compliance will not prove to be a substantial competitive disadvantage vis-\u0430-vis our privately held and larger public competitors.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"Sarbanes-Oxley\") requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley. Our compliance with Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. The effectiveness of our controls and procedures may in the future be limited by a variety of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nfaulty human judgment and simple errors, omissions or mistakes;\n\u00b7\nfraudulent action of an individual or collusion of two or more people;\n\u00b7\ninappropriate management override of procedures; and\n\u00b7\nthe possibility that any enhancements to controls and procedures may still not be adequate to assure timely and accurate financial information.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, we may be subject to NASDAQ delisting, investigations by the SEC and civil or criminal sanctions.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with Section 404 requires us to be able to prepare timely and accurate financial statements. We expect that we will need to continue to improve existing, and implement new operational, financial and accounting systems, procedures and controls to manage our business effectively.\nAny delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls may cause our operations to suffer, and we may be unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required under Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley. If we are unable to complete the required Section 404 assessment as to the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, if we fail to maintain or implement adequate controls, our ability to obtain additional financing could be impaired. In addition, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our internal control over financial reporting and in the accuracy of our periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act. A lack of investor confidence in the reliability and accuracy of our public reporting could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe may be unable to monetize or support our other assets (appendicitis and animal health) on a timely basis or at all, which could distract management's attention from the core pursuit of exploring strategic alternatives, and could have a negative impact on our financial condition.\nWe intend to attempt to monetize the legacy Bioptix appendicitis portfolio and support our animal health assets to maximize liquidity. We may not be successful in such endeavors, could realize less than we anticipate in the disposition or support of such assets, could incur unanticipated costs in such disposition activities and may need to shut down such legacy businesses without realizing any value from such legacy assets. In any such event, our financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nThe legacy Bioptix shareholders will likely experience significant dilution of their ownership in any strategic transaction.\nWe anticipate that any strategic transaction will involve the issuance of our securities, which could have a signification dilutive effect on the percentage ownership of our current shareholders.\nAdvancing on or failure to complete a strategic transaction could likely materially adversely affect Bioptix.\nBioptix will be subject to significant costs, including legal, accounting and advisory fees related to any strategic transaction, which must be paid even if a transaction is not ultimately consummated. Bioptix cannot make any assurance that a future strategic transaction will occur on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nWe may not achieve the anticipated revenue from the out-licensing of our animal health assets.\nIn 2012, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with a third party to license all of our animal health assets in return for license fees, milestone and royalty payments. If product development efforts using our animal health assets are not successful in achieving commercial products, we may not receive all anticipated milestone and royalty payments.\nOur results of operations could be affected by our royalty payments due to third parties.\nAny revenues from products under development will likely be subject to royalty payments under licensing or similar agreements. Major factors affecting these payments include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\ncoverage decisions by governmental and other third party payors;\n\u25cf\nour ability to achieve meaningful sales of our products;\n\u25cf\nthe achievement of milestones established in our license agreements; and\n\u25cf\nour use of the intellectual property licensed in developing the products.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property\nOur competitive position is contingent upon the production of our intellectual property and we may not be able to withstand challenges to our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on our intellectual property, including our issued and applied for patents and our licenses, to help support the value of our assets and business. If our intellectual property rights are challenged, no assurances can be given that our patents or licenses will survive claims alleging invalidity or infringement on other patents or licenses. Additionally, disputes may arise regarding inventorship of our intellectual property. There also could be existing patents of which we are unaware that our products may be infringing upon. As the number of participants in the market grows, the possibility of patent infringement claims against us increases. It is difficult, if not impossible, to determine how such disputes would be resolved. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with patent litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be required to be publicly disclosed. In addition, during the course of patent litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation. Any litigation claims against us may cause us to incur substantial costs and could place a significant strain upon our financial resources, divert the attention of management or restrict our core business or result in the public disclosure of confidential information. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could materially impact our business.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patents and other intellectual property rights, and we may be unable to protect our rights to, or use of, our technology.\nSome or all of our patent applications may not issue as patents, or the claims of any issued patents may not afford meaningful protection for our technologies or products. In addition, patents issued to us or our licensors, if any, may be challenged and subsequently narrowed, invalidated or circumvented. Patent litigation is widespread in the biotechnology industry and could harm our business. Litigation might be necessary to protect our patent position or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights.\nIf we choose to commence legal proceedings to stop someone else from using the inventions claimed in our patents, that individual or company would have the right to ask the court to rule that such patents are invalid or should not be enforced against that third party. These lawsuits are expensive and we may not have the required resources to pursue such litigation or to protect our patent rights. In addition, there is a risk that the court will decide that these patents are not valid and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the inventions. There is also the risk that, even if the validity of these patents is upheld, the court will refuse to stop the other party on the ground that such other party's activities do not infringe our rights in these patents.\nFurthermore, a third party may claim that we are using inventions covered by the third party's patent rights and initiate legal proceedings to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, including making or selling our product candidates. These lawsuits are costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel. There is a risk that a court would decide that we are infringing the third party's patents and would order us to stop the activities covered by the patents. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order us to pay the other party treble damages for having violated the other party's patents. The biotechnology industry has produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods of use either do not infringe the claims of the relevant patent or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity in the United Sates, in particular, is difficult because it requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents.\nBecause some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing, and publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our issued patents or our pending applications or that we were the first to invent the technology. Our competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our patent applications and could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in an interference or other proceeding in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the PTO, or a court to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of our U.S. patent position with respect to such inventions.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends upon compliance with various procedural, document submissions, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe PTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent prosecution process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\nOur failure to secure trademark registrations could adversely affect our ability to market our product candidates and our business.\nOur trademark applications in the United States and any other jurisdiction where we may file, when filed, may not be allowed for registration, and our registered trademarks may not be maintained or enforced. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in the PTO and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our applications or registrations, and our applications or registrations may not survive such proceedings. Failure to secure such trademark registrations in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect our ability to market our product candidates and our business.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information and may not adequately protect our intellectual property, which could impede our ability to compete.\nBecause we operate in the highly technical field of biotechnology we rely in part on trade secret protection in order to protect our proprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect, and we cannot be certain that others will not develop the same or similar technologies on their own. We have taken steps, including entering into confidentiality agreements with all of our employees, consultants and corporate partners, to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how. These agreements generally require that the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all confidential information developed by the party or made known to the party by us during the course of the party's relationship with us. We also typically obtain agreements from these parties which provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property. However, these agreements may not be honored and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets or know-how is difficult, expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets or know-how. The failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive position.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property outside of the United States.\nThe laws in some of those countries may not provide protection for our trade secrets and intellectual property. If our trade secrets or intellectual property are misappropriated in those countries, we may be without adequate remedies to address the issue. Additionally, we also rely on confidentiality and assignment of invention agreements to protect our intellectual property. These agreements provide for contractual remedies in the event of misappropriation. We do not know to what extent, if any, these agreements and any remedies for their breach, will be enforced by a foreign or domestic court. In the event our intellectual property is misappropriated or infringed upon and an adequate remedy is not available, our future prospects will greatly diminish.\nAdditionally, prosecuting and maintaining intellectual property (particularly patent) rights are very costly endeavors. We do not know whether legal and government fees will increase substantially and therefore are unable to predict whether cost may factor into our intellectual property strategy.", "PERMNO": 92213, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "RIOT"}
