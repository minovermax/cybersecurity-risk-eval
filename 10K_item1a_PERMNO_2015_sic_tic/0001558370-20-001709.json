{"cik": "1761312", "company": "Palomar Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A: Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. In deciding whether to invest, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the financial and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects and cause the value of our stock to decline, which could cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties of which we are unaware, or that we currently deem immaterial also may become important factors that affect us.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nClaims arising from unpredictable and severe catastrophe events, including those caused by global climate change, could reduce our earnings and stockholders\u2019 equity and limit our ability to underwrite new insurance policies.\nOur insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of unpredictable catastrophe events, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, windstorms, floods and other severe events. Furthermore, the actual occurrence, frequency and magnitude of such events are uncertain. While there can be no certainty surrounding the timing and magnitude of earthquakes, some observers believe that significant shifts in the tectonic plates, including the San Andreas Fault, may occur in the future. Over the past several years, changing weather patterns and climatic conditions, such as global warming, have added to the unpredictability and frequency of natural disasters in certain parts of the world, including the markets in which we operate. Climate change may increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events. This effect has led to conditions in the ocean and atmosphere, including warmer-than-average sea-surface temperatures and low wind shear that increase hurricane activity. Hurricane activity typically increases between June and November of each year, though the actual occurrence and magnitude of such events is uncertain. The occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophe loss could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Additionally, any increased frequency and severity of such weather events, including hurricanes, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to predict, quantify, reinsure and manage catastrophe risk and may materially increase our losses resulting from such catastrophe events.\nThe extent of losses from catastrophes is a function of both the frequency and severity of the insured events and the total amount of insured exposure in the areas affected. The frequency and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable and the occurrence of one catastrophe does not make the occurrence of another catastrophe more or less likely. Increases in the replacement cost and concentrations of insured property, the effects of inflation, and changes in cyclical weather patterns may increase the severity of claims from catastrophe events in the future. Claims from catastrophe events could reduce our earnings and cause substantial volatility in our results of operations for any fiscal quarter or year, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, possibly to the extent of eliminating our total stockholders\u2019 equity. For example, Hurricane Harvey in August 2017 caused our gross losses and loss adjustment expenses to increase 66% from the prior year. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d Our ability to underwrite new insurance policies could also be materially adversely impacted as a result of corresponding reductions in our capital. In addition, a natural disaster could materially impact the financial condition of our policyholders, resulting in loss of premiums.\nAs of January 1, 2020, we currently retain $5 million of risk per earthquake or wind event, inclusive of any amounts retained through our Bermuda reinsurance subsidiary, and our reinsurance program currently provides for coverage up to $1.2 billion for earthquake events, subject to customary exclusions, with coverage in excess of our estimated peak zone 1 in 250 year PML event and in excess of our A.M. Best requirement. While we only select reinsurers whom we believe to have acceptable credit and a minimum A.M. Best rating of \u201cA\u2212\u201d, if our reinsurers are unable to pay the claims for which they are responsible, we ultimately retain primary liability. Furthermore, our earthquake policies do not provide coverage for fire damage arising from an earthquake. In addition, we maintain reinsurance coverage equivalent or better to 1 in 250 year PML for our other lines. While we believe this risk transfer program insulates us from volatility in our earnings, one severe catastrophe event could result in claims that substantially exceed the limits of our reinsurance coverage.\nWe may be unable to purchase third-party reinsurance or otherwise expand our catastrophe coverage in amounts we desire on commercially acceptable terms or on terms that adequately protect us, and this inability may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe purchase a significant amount of reinsurance from third parties that we believe enhances our business by reducing our exposure to potential catastrophe losses and reducing volatility in our underwriting performance, providing us with greater visibility into our future earnings. Reinsurance involves transferring, or ceding, a portion of our risk exposure on policies that we write to another insurer, the reinsurer, in exchange for a premium. We primarily use treaty reinsurance, consisting of catastrophe excess of loss (\u201cXOL\u201d) coverage, and, on a limited basis, facultative reinsurance coverage. Treaty coverage refers to a reinsurance contract that is applied to a group or class of business where all the risks written meet the criteria for that class. Facultative coverage refers to a reinsurance contract on individual risks as opposed to a group or class of business.\nOur catastrophe XOL treaties are divided into layers, many of which are placed using alternating 24-month contracts. From time to time, market conditions have limited, and in some cases prevented, insurers from obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance they consider adequate for their business needs. As a result, we may not be able to purchase reinsurance in the areas and for the amounts we desire or on terms we deem acceptable or at all. In addition to limit purchased from traditional reinsurers, we have expanded our catastrophe XOL coverage to incorporate collateralized protection from the insurance linked securities (\u201cILS\u201d) market. In May 2017, we closed a $166 million 144A catastrophe bond offering completed through Torrey Pines Re Ltd., a special purpose insurer in Bermuda, that provides fully collateralized protection over a three-year risk period. We may seek to expand our catastrophe XOL coverage through similar bond offerings in the future but there can be no assurances that we will be able to complete such offerings on acceptable terms, if at all. If we are unable to renew our expiring contracts, enter into new reinsurance arrangements on acceptable terms or expand our catastrophe coverage through future bond offerings or otherwise, our loss exposure could increase, which would increase our potential losses related to catastrophe events. If we are unwilling to bear an increase in loss exposure, we could have to reduce the level of our underwriting commitments, both of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany reinsurance companies have begun to exclude certain coverages from, or alter terms in, the reinsurance contracts we enter into with them. As a result, we, like other insurance companies, write insurance policies which to some extent do not have the benefit of reinsurance protection. These gaps in reinsurance protection expose us to greater risk and greater potential losses.\nWe utilize several risk management and loss limitation methods, including relying on estimates and models. If these methods fail to adequately manage our exposure to losses from catastrophe events, our losses could be materially higher than our expectations, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur approach to risk management relies on subjective variables that entail significant uncertainties. We manage our exposure to catastrophe losses by analyzing the probability and severity of the occurrence of catastrophe events and the impact of such events on our overall underwriting and investment portfolio. We monitor and mitigate our exposure through a number of methods designed to minimize risk, including underwriting specialization, modeling and data systems, data quality control, strategic use of policy deductibles and regular review of aggregate exposure and probable maximum loss reports, which report the maximum amount of losses that one would expect based on computer or actuarial modeling techniques. These estimates, models, data and scenarios may not produce accurate predictions; consequently, we could incur losses both in the risks we underwrite and to the value of our investment portfolio.\nIn addition, output from our risk modeling software is based on third-party data that we believe to be reliable. The estimates and assumptions we use are dependent on many variables, such as loss adjustment expenses, insurance-to-value, storm or earthquake intensity, building code compliance and demand surge, which is the temporary inflation of costs for building materials and labor resulting from increased demand for rebuilding services in the aftermath of a catastrophe. Accordingly, if the estimates and assumptions used in our risk models are incorrect or if our risk models prove to be an inaccurate forecasting tool, the losses we might incur from an actual catastrophe could be materially higher than our expectation of losses generated from modeled catastrophe scenarios, and our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, our third-party data providers may change the estimates or assumptions that we use in our risk models and/or their data may be inaccurate. Changes in these estimates or assumptions or the use of inaccurate third-party data could cause our actual losses to be materially higher than our current expectation of losses generated by modeled catastrophe scenarios, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe run many model simulations in order to understand the impact of these assumptions on a catastrophe\u2019s loss potential. Furthermore, there are risks associated with catastrophe events, which are either poorly represented or not represented at all by catastrophe models. Each modeling assumption or un-modeled risk introduces uncertainty into probable maximum loss estimates that management must consider. These uncertainties can include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nThe models do not address all the possible hazard characteristics of a catastrophe peril (e.g., the precise path and wind speed of a hurricane);\n\u00b7\nThe models may not accurately reflect the true frequency of events;\n\u00b7\nThe models may not accurately reflect a risk\u2019s vulnerability or susceptibility to damage for a given event characteristic;\n\u00b7\nThe models may not accurately represent loss potential to insurance or reinsurance contract coverage limits, terms and conditions; and\n\u00b7\nThe models may not accurately reflect the impact on the economy of the area affected or the financial, judicial, political, or regulatory impacts on insurance claim payments during or following a catastrophe event.\nAs a result of these factors and contingencies, our reliance on assumptions and data used to evaluate our entire risk portfolio and specifically to estimate a probable maximum loss is subject to a high degree of uncertainty that could result in actual losses that are materially different from our probable maximum loss estimates and our financial results could be adversely affected.\nA decline in our financial strength rating may adversely affect the amount of business we write.\nParticipants in the insurance industry use ratings from independent ratings agencies, such as A.M. Best, as an important means of assessing the financial strength and quality of insurers. In setting its ratings, A.M. Best performs quantitative and qualitative analysis of a company\u2019s balance sheet strength, operating performance and business profile. A.M. Best financial strength ratings range from \u201cA++\u201d (Superior) to \u201cF\u201d for insurance companies that have been publicly placed in liquidation. As of December 31, 2019, A.M. Best has assigned a financial strength rating of \u201cA\u2212\u201d (Excellent) (Outlook Stable) to us. A.M. Best assigns ratings that are intended to provide an independent opinion of an insurance company\u2019s ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and such ratings are not evaluations directed to investors and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our common stock or any other securities we may issue. A.M. Best\u2019s analysis includes comparisons to peers and industry standards as well as assessments of operating plans, philosophy and management. A.M. Best periodically reviews our financial strength rating and may revise it downward or revoke it at A.M. Best\u2019s discretion based primarily on its analyses of our balance sheet strength (including capital adequacy and loss adjustment expense reserve adequacy), operating performance and business profile. Factors that could affect such analyses include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7\nIf we change our business practices from our organizational business plan in a manner that no longer supports A.M. Best\u2019s rating;\n\u00b7\nIf unfavorable financial, regulatory or market trends affect us, including excess market capacity;\n\u00b7\nIf our losses exceed our loss reserves;\n\u00b7\nIf we have unresolved issues with government regulators;\n\u00b7\nIf we are unable to retain our senior management or other key personnel;\n\u00b7\nIf our investment portfolio incurs significant losses; or\n\u00b7\nIf A.M. Best alters its capital adequacy assessment methodology in a manner that would adversely affect our rating.\nThese and other factors could result in a downgrade of our financial strength rating. A downgrade or withdrawal of our rating could result in any of the following consequences, among others:\n\u00b7\nCausing our current and future distribution partners and insureds to choose other, more highly-rated competitors;\n\u00b7\nIncreasing the cost or reducing the availability of reinsurance to us; or\n\u00b7\nSeverely limiting or preventing us from writing new and renewal insurance contracts.\nIn addition, in view of the earnings and capital pressures experienced by many financial institutions, including insurance companies, it is possible that rating organizations will heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions, will increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, will request additional information from the companies that they rate or will increase the capital and other requirements employed in the rating organizations\u2019 models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. We can offer no assurance that our rating will remain at its current level. It is possible that such reviews of us may result in adverse ratings consequences, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reinsurers may not pay claims on a timely basis, or at all, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer, it does not relieve us (the ceding insurer) of our primary liability to our policyholders. Our current reinsurance program is designed to limit our risk retention to $5 million of risk per earthquake or wind event, inclusive of any amounts retained through our Bermuda reinsurance subsidiary, and provide coverage up to $1.2 billion for earthquake events, subject to customary exclusions. However, particularly in the event of a major catastrophe our reinsurers may not pay claims made by us on a timely basis, or they may not pay some or all of these claims. For example, reinsurers may default in their financial obligations to us as the result of insolvency, lack of liquidity, operational failure, fraud, asserted defenses based on agreement wordings or the principle of utmost good faith, asserted deficiencies in the documentation of agreements or other reasons. Any disputes with reinsurers regarding coverage under reinsurance contracts could be time consuming, costly, and uncertain of success. We evaluate each reinsurance claim based on the facts of the case, historical experience with the reinsurer on similar claims and existing case law and consider including any amounts deemed uncollectible from the reinsurer in a reserve for uncollectible reinsurance. As of December 31, 2019, we had $17.3 million of aggregate reinsurance recoverables. These risks could cause us to incur increased net losses, and, therefore, adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur business is concentrated in California and Texas and, as a result, we are exposed more significantly to California and Texas loss activity and regulatory environments.\nOur policyholders and insurance risks are currently concentrated in California and Texas, which generated 56% and 18% of our gross written premiums, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019. Any single, major catastrophe event, series of events or other condition causing significant losses in California or Texas could materially\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, unfavorable business, economic or regulatory conditions in these states may result in a significant reduction of our premiums or increase our loss exposure. We are exposed to business, economic, political and regulatory risks due to this concentration that are greater than the risks faced by insurance companies that conduct business over a more extensive geographic area.\nChanges in California or Texas political climates could result in new or changed legislation affecting the property and casualty insurance industry in general and insurers writing residential earthquake and wind coverage in particular.\nWe could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more key executives or by an inability to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nWe depend on our ability to attract and retain experienced personnel and seasoned key executives who are knowledgeable about our business. The pool of talent from which we actively recruit is limited and may fluctuate based on market dynamics specific to our industry and independent of overall economic conditions. As such, higher demand for employees having the desired skills and expertise could lead to increased compensation expectations for existing and prospective personnel, making it difficult for us to retain and recruit key personnel and maintain labor costs at desired levels. In particular, our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Mac Armstrong, and our Chief Financial Officer, Christopher Uchida. Should any of our key executives terminate their employment with us, or if we are unable to retain and attract talented personnel, we may be unable to maintain our current competitive position in the specialized markets in which we operate, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe rely on a select group of brokers and program administrators, and such relationships may not continue.\nThe distribution networks of our products are multi-faceted and distinct to each line of business. Our relationship with our brokers or program administrators may be discontinued at any time. Even if the relationships do continue, they may not be on terms that are profitable for us. We distribute a significant portion of our Residential Earthquake, Commercial Earthquake, Specialty Homeowners and Hawaii Hurricane products through longstanding relationships with two program administrators. Each of the four products managed by the program administrators operates as a separate program that is governed by an independent, separately negotiated agreement with unique terms and conditions, including geographic scope, key men provisions, economics and exclusivity. These programs also feature separate managerial oversight and leadership, policy administration systems and retail agents originating policies. In total, these four products accounted for $148.6 million or 59.0% of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $104.9 million or 67.7% of our gross written premiums for the year ended December 31, 2018. This amount includes our Value Select Residential Earthquake program, which represents the majority of our Residential Earthquake premium and is administered through a mutually exclusive program administrator agreement with Arrowhead for the states of California, Oregon and Washington. The termination of a relationship with one or more significant brokers or program administrators could result in lower gross written premiums and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or business prospects.\nUnexpected changes in the interpretation of our coverage or provisions, including loss limitations and exclusions, in our policies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurances that specifically negotiated loss limitations or exclusions in our policies will be enforceable in the manner we intend. As industry practices and legal, judicial, social, and other conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. For example, many of our policies limit the period during which a policyholder may bring a claim, which may be shorter than the statutory period under which such claims can be brought against our policyholders. While these limitations and exclusions help us assess and mitigate our loss exposure, it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void a limitation or exclusion or legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of such limitations or exclusions. These types of governmental actions could result in higher than anticipated losses and loss adjustment expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, court decisions, such as the 1995 Montrose decision\nin California could read policy exclusions narrowly so as to expand coverage, thereby requiring insurers to create and write new exclusions.\nThese issues may adversely affect our business by either broadening coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the frequency or severity of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until sometime after we have issued insurance contracts that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued.\nCompetition for business in our industry is intense.\nWe face competition from other specialty insurance companies, standard insurance companies and underwriting agencies that are larger than we are and that have greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we do. Some of these competitors also have longer operating history and more market recognition than we do in certain lines of business. In addition, we compete against state or other publicly managed enterprises including the California Earthquake Authority (\u201cCEA\u201d), the National Flood Insurance Program and the Texas Wind Insurance Association. If the CEA decided to provide coverage to non-CEA member carriers or lessened the capital requirements for membership, we would face additional competition in our markets, and our operating results could be adversely affected. Furthermore, it may be difficult or prohibitively expensive for us to implement technology systems and processes that are competitive with the systems and processes of these larger companies.\nIn particular, competition in the insurance industry is based on many factors, including price of coverage, the general reputation and perceived financial strength of the company, relationships with brokers, terms and conditions of products offered, ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, speed of claims payment and reputation, and the experience and reputation of the members of our underwriting team in the particular lines of insurance and reinsurance we seek to underwrite. In recent years, the insurance industry has undergone increasing consolidation, which may further increase competition.\nA number of new, proposed or potential industry or legislative developments could further increase competition in our industry. These developments include:\n\u00b7\nAn increase in capital-raising by companies in our lines of business, which could result in new entrants to our markets and an excess of capital in the industry; and\n\u00b7\nThe deregulation of commercial insurance lines in certain states and the possibility of federal regulatory reform of the insurance industry, which could increase competition from standard carriers.\nWe may not be able to continue to compete successfully in the insurance markets. Increased competition in these markets could result in a change in the supply and demand for insurance, affect our ability to price our products at risk-adequate rates and retain existing business, or underwrite new business on favorable terms. If this increased competition so limits our ability to transact business, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe failure of our information technology and telecommunications systems could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is highly dependent upon our information technology and telecommunications systems, including our underwriting system. We rely on these systems to interact with brokers and insureds, to underwrite business, to prepare policies and process premiums, to perform actuarial and other modeling functions, to process claims and make claims payments, and to prepare internal and external financial statements and information. Some of these systems may include or rely on third-party systems not located on our premises or under our control. Events such as natural catastrophes, terrorist attacks, industrial accidents or computer viruses may cause our systems to fail or be inaccessible for extended periods of time. While we have implemented business contingency plans and other reasonable plans to protect our systems, sustained or repeated system failures or service denials could severely limit our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or otherwise operate in the ordinary course of business.\nOur operations depend on the reliable and secure processing, storage, and transmission of confidential and other data and information in our computer systems and networks. Computer viruses, hackers, employee misconduct, and other external hazards could expose our systems to security breaches, cyber-attacks or other disruptions. In addition, we routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary data and information by electronic means and are subject to numerous data privacy laws and regulations enacted in the jurisdictions in which we do business.\nWhile we have implemented security measures designed to protect against breaches of security and other interference with our systems and networks, our systems and networks may be subject to breaches or interference. Any such event may result in operational disruptions as well as unauthorized access to or the disclosure or loss of our proprietary information or our customers\u2019 data and information, which in turn may result in legal claims, regulatory scrutiny and liability, reputational damage, the incurrence of costs to eliminate or mitigate further exposure, the loss of customers or affiliated advisors, reputational harm or other damage to our business. In addition, the trend toward general public notification of such incidents could exacerbate the harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we successfully protect our technology infrastructure and the confidentiality of sensitive data, we could suffer harm to our business and reputation if attempted security breaches are publicized. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, discovery of new vulnerabilities, attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in our systems, data thefts, physical system or network break-ins or inappropriate access, or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology or other security measures protecting the networks and systems used in connection with our business.\nAny failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our intellectual property, proprietary technology platform and brand, or we may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in part on our intellectual property, which includes our rights in our proprietary technology platform and our brand. We primarily rely on copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, and confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, service providers, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. However, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may be inadequate. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Additionally, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability and scope of our intellectual property rights. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our brand and adversely impact our business.\nOur success depends also in part on our not infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. Our competitors, as well as a number of other entities and individuals, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our industry. In the future, third parties may claim that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing on such rights. Any claims or litigation could cause us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our services, or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. Even if we were to prevail in such a dispute, any litigation could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.\nBecause we provide our program administrators with specific quoting and binding authority, if any of them fail to comply with pre-established guidelines, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe market and distribute certain of our insurance products through program administrators that have limited quoting and binding authority and that in turn sell our insurance products to insureds through retail agents and wholesale brokers. These program administrators can bind certain risks without our initial approval. If any of these program administrators fail to comply with our underwriting guidelines and the terms of their appointments, we could be bound on a particular risk or number of risks that were not anticipated when we developed the insurance products or estimated losses and loss adjustment expenses. Such actions could adversely affect our results of operations.\nBecause our business depends on insurance brokers and program administrators, we are exposed to certain risks arising out of our reliance on these distribution channels that could adversely affect our results.\nCertain premiums from policyholders, where the business is produced by brokers, are collected directly by the brokers and forwarded to our U.S. insurance subsidiary. In certain jurisdictions, when the insured pays its policy premium to its broker for payment on behalf of our U.S. insurance subsidiary, the premium might be considered to have been paid under applicable insurance laws and regulations. Accordingly, the insured would no longer be liable to us for those amounts, whether or not we have actually received the premium from that broker. Consequently, we assume a degree of credit risk associated with the brokers with which we work. We review the financial condition of potential new brokers before we agree to transact business with them. Although the failure by any of our brokers to remit premiums to us has not been material to date, there may be instances where our brokers collect premiums but do not remit them to us and we may be required under applicable law to provide the coverage set forth in the policy despite the related premiums not being paid to us.\nBecause the possibility of these events occurring depends in large part upon the financial condition and internal operations of our brokers, we monitor broker behavior and review financial information on an as-needed basis. If we are unable to collect premiums from our brokers in the future, our underwriting profits may decline and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur failure to accurately and timely pay claims could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe must accurately and timely evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies. Many factors affect our ability to pay claims accurately and timely, including the training and experience of our claims representatives, including our third-party claims administrators (\u201cTPAs\u201d), the effectiveness of our management, and our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures and systems to support our claims functions and other factors. Our failure to pay claims accurately and timely could lead to regulatory and administrative actions or material litigation, undermine our reputation in the marketplace and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIn addition, if we do not manage our TPAs effectively, or if our TPAs are unable to effectively handle our volume of claims, our ability to handle an increasing workload could be adversely affected. In addition to potentially requiring that growth be slowed in the affected markets, our business could suffer from decreased quality of claims work which, in turn, could adversely affect our operating margins.\nWe employ third-party licensed software for use in our business, and the inability to maintain these licenses, errors in the software we license or the terms of open source licenses could result in increased costs or reduced service levels, which would adversely affect our business.\nOur business relies on certain third-party software obtained under licenses from other companies. We anticipate that we will continue to rely on such third-party software in the future. Although we believe that there are commercially reasonable alternatives to the third-party software we currently license, this may not always be the case, or it may be difficult or costly to replace. In addition, integration of new third-party software may require significant work and require substantial investment of our time and resources. Our use of additional or alternative third-party software would require us to enter into license agreements with third parties, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Many of the risks associated with the use of third-party software cannot be eliminated, and these risks could negatively affect our business.\nAdditionally, the software powering our technology systems incorporates software covered by open source licenses. The terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that the licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to operate our systems. In the event that portions of our proprietary software are determined to be subject to an open source license, we could be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code or re-engineer all or a portion of our\ntechnology systems, each of which could reduce or eliminate the value of our technology systems. Such risk could be difficult or impossible to eliminate and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdverse economic factors, including recession, inflation, periods of high unemployment or lower economic activity could result in the sale of fewer policies than expected or an increase in the frequency of claims and premium defaults, and even the falsification of claims, or a combination of these effects, which, in turn, could affect our growth and profitability.\nFactors, such as business revenue, economic conditions, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, and inflation can affect the business and economic environment. These same factors affect our ability to generate revenue and profits. In an economic downturn that is characterized by higher unemployment, declining spending, and reduced corporate revenue, the demand for insurance products is generally adversely affected, which directly affects our premium levels and profitability. Negative economic factors may also affect our ability to receive the appropriate rate for the risk we insure with our policyholders and may adversely affect the number of policies we can write, and our opportunities to underwrite profitable business. In an economic downturn, our customers may have less need for insurance coverage, cancel existing insurance policies, modify their coverage or not renew the policies they hold with us. Existing policyholders may exaggerate or even falsify claims to obtain higher claims payments. These outcomes would reduce our underwriting profit to the extent these factors are not reflected in the rates we charge.\nWe underwrite a significant portion of our insurance in California and Texas. Any economic downturn in either state could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nPerformance of our investment portfolio is subject to a variety of investment risks that may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur results of operations depend, in part, on the performance of our investment portfolio. We seek to hold a diversified portfolio of investments that is managed by a professional investment advisory management firm in accordance with our investment policy and routinely reviewed by our Investment Committee. Our investments are subject to general economic conditions and market risks as well as risks inherent to particular securities.\nOur primary market risk exposures relate to changes in interest rates and equity prices. Future increases in interest rates could cause the values of our fixed maturity securities portfolios to decline, with the magnitude of the decline depending on the duration of securities included in our portfolio and the amount by which interest rates increase. Some fixed maturity securities have call or prepayment options, which create possible reinvestment risk in declining rate environments. Other fixed maturity securities, such as mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, carry prepayment risk or, in a rising interest rate environment, may not prepay as quickly as expected.\nThe value of our investment portfolio is subject to the risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of one or more issuers of the securities we hold, or due to deterioration in the financial condition of an insurer that guarantees an issuer\u2019s payments on such investments. Downgrades in the credit ratings of fixed maturities also have a significant negative effect on the market valuation of such securities.\nSuch factors could reduce our net investment income and result in realized investment losses. Our investment portfolio is subject to increased valuation uncertainties when investment markets are illiquid. The valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are illiquid, thereby increasing the risk that the estimated fair value (i.e., the carrying amount) of the securities we hold in our portfolio does not reflect prices at which actual transactions would occur.\nWe also invest in marketable equity securities, generally through mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that provide exposure to the U.S. investment-grade bond market. These securities are carried on the balance sheet at fair market value and are subject to potential losses and declines in market value. Our equity invested assets totaled $22.3 million as of December 31, 2019.\nRisks for all types of securities are managed through the application of our investment policy, which establishes investment parameters that include but are not limited to, maximum percentages of investment in certain types of securities and minimum levels of credit quality, which we believe are within applicable guidelines established by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\u201cNAIC\u201d), the Oregon Division of Financial Regulation and the California Department of Insurance.\nAlthough we seek to preserve our capital, we cannot be certain that our investment objectives will be achieved, and results may vary substantially over time. In addition, although we seek to employ investment strategies that are not correlated with our insurance and reinsurance exposures, losses in our investment portfolio may occur at the same time as underwriting losses and, therefore, exacerbate the adverse effect of the losses on us.\nWe could be forced to sell investments to meet our liquidity requirements.\nWe invest the premiums we receive from our insureds until they are needed to pay policyholder claims. Consequently, we seek to manage the duration of our investment portfolio based on the duration of our losses and loss adjustment expense reserves to provide sufficient liquidity and avoid having to liquidate investments to fund claims. Risks such as inadequate losses and loss adjustment reserves or unfavorable trends in litigation could potentially result in the need to sell investments to fund these liabilities. We may not be able to sell our investments at favorable prices or at all. Sales could result in significant realized losses depending on the conditions of the general market, interest rates, and credit issues with individual securities.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, which may adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. In addition, if we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including fines and suspensions, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur U.S. insurance company subsidiary, Palomar Specialty Insurance Company, is subject to extensive regulation in Oregon, its state of domicile, California, where it is commercially domiciled, and to a lesser degree, the other states in which it operates. Our Bermuda reinsurance subsidiary, Palomar Specialty Reinsurance Company Bermuda Ltd. (\u201cPalomar Re\u201d), is subject to regulation in Bermuda. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of insurance policyholders, as opposed to the interests of investors or stockholders. These regulations generally are administered by a department of insurance in each state and relate to, among other things, capital and surplus requirements, investment and underwriting limitations, affiliate transactions, dividend limitations, changes in control, solvency and a variety of other financial and non-financial aspects of our business. Significant changes in these laws and regulations could further limit our discretion or make it more expensive to conduct our business. State insurance regulators and the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the \u201cBMA\u201d), also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance and reinsurance companies and require the filing of annual and other reports relating to financial condition, holding company issues and other matters. These regulatory requirements may impose timing and expense constraints that could adversely affect our ability to achieve some or all of our business objectives.\nOur U.S. insurance subsidiary is part of an \u201cinsurance holding company system\u201d within the meaning of applicable California and Oregon statutes and regulations. As a result of such status, certain transactions between our U.S. insurance subsidiary and one or more of their affiliates, such as a tax sharing agreement or cost sharing arrangement, may not be effected unless the insurer has provided notice of that transaction to the California Department of Insurance or the Oregon Division of Financial Regulation, as applicable, at least 30 days prior to engaging in the transaction and the California Department of Insurance or the Oregon Division of Financial Regulation, as applicable, has not disapproved such transaction within the 30-day time period. These prior notification requirements may result in business delays and additional business expenses. If our U.S. insurance subsidiary fails to file a required notification or fail to comply with other applicable insurance regulations in California or Oregon, we may be subject to significant fines and penalties and our working relationship with the California Department of Insurance or the Oregon Division of Financial Regulation, as applicable, may be impaired.\nIn addition, state insurance regulators have broad discretion to deny or revoke licenses for various reasons, including the violation of regulations. In some instances, where there is uncertainty as to applicability, we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations or practices that we believe generally to be followed by the industry.\nThese practices may turn out to be different from the interpretations of regulatory authorities. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, state insurance regulators could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our activities or could otherwise penalize us. This could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. Further, changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities could interfere with our operations and require us to bear additional costs of compliance, which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nOur U.S. insurance subsidiary is subject to risk-based capital requirements, based upon the \u201crisk based capital model\u201d adopted by the NAIC, and other minimum capital and surplus restrictions imposed under Oregon and California law. These requirements establish the minimum amount of risk-based capital necessary for a company to support its overall business operations. It identifies property and casualty insurers that may be inadequately capitalized by looking at certain inherent risks of each insurer\u2019s assets and liabilities and its mix of net written premium. Insurers falling below a calculated threshold may be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, including supervision, rehabilitation or liquidation. Failure to maintain our risk-based capital at the required levels could adversely affect the ability of our U.S. insurance subsidiary to maintain regulatory authority to conduct our business. See also \u201cRegulation-Required Licensing.\u201d\nOur Bermuda reinsurance subsidiary is subject to regulation from the European Union. The European Union adopted the Economic Substance Act 2018 and the Economic Substance Regulations 2018 (together, the \u201cES Requirements\u201d). As an insurance company, our Bermuda subsidiary conducts a relevant activity and will be subject to the ES Requirements. As a result, our Bermuda subsidiary may be required to change or increase our business operations in Bermuda in order to meet the new requirements. Compliance with the ES Requirements is required with effect from July 1, 2019.\nWe may become subject to additional government or market regulation, which may have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur business could be adversely affected by changes in state laws, including those relating to asset and reserve valuation requirements, surplus requirements, limitations on investments and dividends, enterprise risk and risk-based capital requirements, and, at the federal level, by laws and regulations that may affect certain aspects of the insurance industry, including proposals for preemptive federal regulation. The U.S. federal government generally has not directly regulated the insurance industry except for certain areas of the market, such as insurance for flood, nuclear and terrorism risks. However, the federal government has undertaken initiatives or considered legislation in several areas that may affect the insurance industry, including tort reform, corporate governance and the taxation of reinsurance companies. In addition, the Bermuda reinsurance regulatory framework has become subject to increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions. As a result, the BMA has implemented and imposed additional requirements on the companies it regulates, which requirements could adversely impact the operations of our reinsurance subsidiary.\nChanges in tax laws as a result of the enactment of recent tax legislation could impact our operations and profitability.\nLegislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act made significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax rules for taxation of individuals and corporations, generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. In the case of individuals, the tax brackets have been adjusted, the top federal income rate has been reduced to 37%, special rules have reduced taxation of certain income earned through pass-through entities and various deductions have been eliminated or limited, including limiting the deduction for state and local taxes to $10,000 per year, decreasing the mortgage interest deduction on new homes to $750,000 and eliminating the home equity line of credit interest deduction for loans that are not considered home acquisition debt.\nChanges in these deductions may affect taxpayers in states with high residential home prices and high state and local taxes, such as California, and may also negatively impact the housing market. This in turn may negatively impact our growth in these markets if there is lower demand in the housing market as a consequence of the Tax Act.\nIf states increase the assessments that Palomar Specialty Insurance Company is required to pay, our business, financial condition and results of operations would suffer.\nCertain jurisdictions in which Palomar Specialty Insurance Company is admitted to transact business require property and casualty insurers doing business within that jurisdiction to participate in insurance guaranty associations. These organizations pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. They levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer is engaged. States may also assess admitted companies in order to fund their respective department of insurance operations. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offset or in limited circumstances by surcharging policyholders.\nPalomar Specialty Insurance Company is licensed to conduct insurance operations on an admitted basis in 27 states and has applied for state approval for licenses in additional states. As Palomar Specialty Insurance Company grows, our share of any assessments in each state in which it underwrites business on an admitted basis may increase. We paid assessments of $9,587 in 2017, $1.1 million in 2018, and $14,750 in 2019. The increase in assessments paid during 2018 was primarily due to amounts assessed by the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association and Texas Fair Plan Association relating to Hurricane Harvey, with such amounts recovered from our reinsurers. We cannot predict with certainty the amount of future assessments, because they depend on factors outside our control, such as insolvencies of other insurance companies as well as the occurrence of significant catastrophes similar to Hurricane Harvey. Generally speaking, assessments are covered by our catastrophe XOL treaties and, to the extent we have experienced a net loss from an event in excess of our net retention, assessments would be recovered from our reinsurers with no additional expense to us. However, although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer, it does not relieve us (the ceding insurer) of our primary liability to our policyholders. Significant assessments could result in higher than expected operating expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, while some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offset or, in limited circumstances, by surcharging policyholders, there is no certainty that offsets or surcharges will be permitted in connection with any future assessments.\nBecause we are a holding company and substantially all of our operations are conducted by our insurance subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends depends on our ability to obtain cash dividends or other permitted payments from our insurance subsidiaries.\nThe continued operation and growth of our business will require substantial capital. We do not intend to declare and pay cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. See \u201cDividend Policy.\u201d Because we are a holding company with no business operations of our own, our ability to pay dividends to stockholders largely depends on dividends and other distributions from our insurance subsidiaries, Palomar Specialty Insurance Company and Palomar Re. State insurance laws, including the laws of Oregon and California, and the laws of Bermuda restrict the ability of Palomar Specialty Insurance Company and Palomar Re, respectively, to declare stockholder dividends. State insurance regulators require insurance companies to maintain specified levels of statutory capital and surplus. The maximum dividend distribution absent the approval or non-disapproval of the insurance regulatory authority in Oregon and California is limited by Oregon law at ORS 732.576 and California law at Cal. Ins. Code 1215.5(g). Dividend payments are further limited to that part of available policyholder surplus that is derived from net profits on our business. State insurance regulators have broad powers to prevent the reduction of statutory surplus to inadequate levels, and there is no assurance that dividends up to the maximum amounts calculated under any applicable formula would be permitted. Moreover, state insurance regulators that have jurisdiction over the payment of dividends by Palomar Specialty Insurance Company may in the future adopt statutory provisions more restrictive than those currently in effect.\nOur Bermuda reinsurance subsidiary is highly regulated and is required to comply with various conditions before it is able to pay dividends or make distributions to us. Bermuda law, including the Insurance Act 1978, as amended (\u201cInsurance Act\u201d) and the Companies Act 1981, as amended (\u201cCompanies Act\u201d) impose restrictions on our Bermuda reinsurance subsidiary\u2019s ability to pay dividends to us based on solvency margins and surplus and capital requirements. These restrictions, and any other future restrictions adopted by the BMA, could have the effect, under\ncertain circumstances, of significantly reducing dividends or other amounts payable to us by our Bermuda reinsurance subsidiary without affirmative approval of the BMA.\nAny determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant. Consequently, investors may need to sell all or part of their holdings of our common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking immediate cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nOur operating results have in the past varied from quarter to quarter and may not be indicative of our long-term prospects.\nOur operating results are subject to fluctuation and have historically varied from quarter to quarter. We expect our quarterly results to continue to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors, including the general economic conditions in the markets where we operate, the frequency of occurrence or severity of catastrophe or other insured events, fluctuating interest rates, claims exceeding our loss reserves, competition in our industry, deviations from expected premium retention rates of our existing policies and contracts, adverse investment performance, and the cost of reinsurance coverage.\nIn particular, we seek to underwrite products and make investments to achieve favorable returns on tangible stockholders\u2019 equity over the long term. In addition, our opportunistic nature and focus on long-term growth in tangible equity may result in fluctuations in gross written premiums from period to period as we concentrate on underwriting contracts that we believe will generate better long-term, rather than short-term, results. Accordingly, our short-term results of operations may not be indicative of our long-term prospects.\nWe may act based on inaccurate or incomplete information regarding the accounts we underwrite.\nWe rely on information provided by insureds or their representatives when underwriting insurance policies. While we may make inquiries to validate or supplement the information provided, we may make underwriting decisions based on incorrect or incomplete information. It is possible that we will misunderstand the nature or extent of the activities or facilities and the corresponding extent of the risks that we insure because of our reliance on inadequate or inaccurate information.\nOur employees could take excessive risks, which could negatively affect our financial condition and business.\nAs an insurance enterprise, we are in the business of binding certain risks. The employees who conduct our business, including executive officers and other members of management, underwriters, product managers and other employees, do so in part by making decisions and choices that involve exposing us to risk. These include decisions such as setting underwriting guidelines and standards, product design and pricing, determining which business opportunities to pursue, and other decisions. We endeavor, in the design and implementation of our compensation programs and practices, to avoid giving our employees incentives to take excessive risks. Employees may, however, take such risks regardless of the structure of our compensation programs and practices. Similarly, although we employ controls and procedures designed to monitor employees\u2019 business decisions and prevent them from taking excessive risks, these controls and procedures may not be effective. If our employees take excessive risks, the impact of those risks could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and business operations.\nWe may require additional capital in the future, which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses. Many factors will affect the amount and timing of our capital needs, including our growth rate and profitability, our claims experience, and the availability of reinsurance, market disruptions, and other unforeseeable developments. If we need to raise additional capital, equity or debt financing may not be available at all or may be available only on terms that are not favorable to\nus. In the case of equity financings, dilution to our stockholders could result. In the case of debt financings, we may be subject to covenants that restrict our ability to freely operate our business. In any case, such securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to those of the shares of common stock offered hereby. If we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all, we may not have sufficient funds to implement our operating plans and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to manage our growth effectively.\nWe intend to grow our business in the future, which could require additional capital, systems development and skilled personnel. However, we must be able to meet our capital needs, expand our systems and our internal controls effectively, allocate our human resources optimally, identify and hire qualified employees and effectively incorporate the components of any businesses we may acquire in our effort to achieve growth. The failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf actual renewals of our existing contracts do not meet expectations, our written premium in future years and our future results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nMost of our contracts are written for a one-year term. In our financial forecasting process, we make assumptions about the rates of renewal of our prior year\u2019s contracts. The insurance and reinsurance industries have historically been cyclical businesses with intense competition, often based on price. If actual renewals do not meet expectations or if we choose not to write a renewal because of pricing conditions, our written premium in future years and our future operations would be materially adversely affected.\nWe may change our underwriting guidelines or our strategy without stockholder approval.\nOur management has the authority to change our underwriting guidelines or our strategy without notice to our stockholders and without stockholder approval. As a result, we may make fundamental changes to our operations without stockholder approval, which could result in our pursuing a strategy or implementing underwriting guidelines that may be materially different from the strategy or underwriting guidelines described in the section titled \u201cBusiness\u201d or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe effects of litigation on our business are uncertain and could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAs is typical in our industry, we continually face risks associated with litigation of various types, including disputes relating to insurance claims under our policies as well as other general commercial and corporate litigation. Although we are not currently involved in any material litigation with our customers, other members of the insurance industry are the target of class action lawsuits and other types of litigation, some of which involve claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts, and the outcomes of which are unpredictable. This litigation is based on a variety of issues, including insurance and claim settlement practices. We cannot predict with any certainty whether we will be involved in such litigation in the future or what impact such litigation would have on our business.\nChanges in accounting practices and future pronouncements may materially affect our reported financial results.\nDevelopments in accounting practices may require us to incur considerable additional expenses to comply, particularly if we are required to prepare information relating to prior periods for comparative purposes or to apply the new requirements retroactively. Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). The impact of changes in GAAP cannot be predicted but may affect the calculation of net income, stockholders\u2019 equity and other relevant financial statement line items.\nIn addition to compliance with GAAP on a consolidated basis, our U.S. insurance subsidiary, Palomar Specialty Insurance Company, is required to comply with statutory accounting principles (\u201cSAP\u201d). SAP and various components of SAP are subject to constant review by the NAIC and its task forces and committees, as well as state insurance departments, in an effort to address emerging issues and otherwise improve financial reporting. Various proposals are pending before committees and task forces of the NAIC, some of which, if enacted, could have negative effects on\ninsurance industry participants. The NAIC continuously examines existing laws and regulations. We cannot predict whether or in what form such reforms will be enacted and, if so, whether the enacted reforms will positively or negatively affect us.\nWe rely on the use of credit scoring in pricing and underwriting certain of our insurance policies and any legal or regulatory requirements that restrict our ability to access credit score information could decrease the accuracy of our pricing and underwriting process and thus decrease our ability to be profitable.\nWe use credit scoring as a factor in pricing and underwriting decisions where allowed by state law. Consumer groups and regulators have questioned whether the use of credit scoring unfairly discriminates against some groups of people and are calling for laws and regulations to prohibit or restrict the use of credit scoring in underwriting and pricing. Laws or regulations that significantly curtail or regulate the use of credit scoring, if enacted in a large number of states in which we operate, could impact the integrity of our pricing and underwriting processes, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and make it harder for us to be profitable over time.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nGenstar Capital owns a significant amount of our common stock and has the ability to exert significant influence over us and our corporate decisions.\nGenstar Capital currently controls approximately 14.6% of our common stock. Currently, one of our directors, James Ryan Clark, is affiliated with Genstar Capital. Mr. Clark has fiduciary duties to us and, in addition, has duties to Genstar Capital. As a result, this director may face real or apparent conflicts of interest with respect to matters affecting both us and Genstar Capital, whose interests may be adverse to ours in some circumstances\nIn addition, we are party to a Stockholders Agreement with Genstar Capital that permits Genstar Capital to exert influence over us and our corporate decisions. The Stockholders Agreement specifies that until such time as Genstar Capital beneficially owns less than 10% of our outstanding common stock we will not take certain significant actions specified therein without the prior written consent of Genstar Capital, including, but not limited to, (i) amendments or modifications to our or our subsidiaries\u2019 organizational documents in a manner that adversely affects Genstar Capital, (ii) making any payment or declaration of any dividend or other distribution on any shares of our common stock, (iii) merging or consolidating with or into any other entity, or transferring all or substantially all of our or our subsidiaries\u2019 assets, taken as a whole, to another entity, or entering into or agreeing to undertake any transaction that would constitute a \u201cChange of Control\u201d as defined in our or our subsidiaries\u2019 credit facilities, (iv) other than in the ordinary course of business with vendors, customers and suppliers, entering into or effecting any (A) acquisition by us or any of our subsidiaries of the equity interests or assets of any person, or the acquisition by us or any of our subsidiaries of any business, properties, assets, or person, in one transaction or a series of related transactions or (B) disposition of assets of us or any of our subsidiaries or the shares or other equity interests of any of our subsidiary, in each case where the amount of consideration for any such acquisition or disposition exceeds $15 million in any single transaction, or an aggregate amount of $30 million in any series of transactions during a calendar year, (v) undertaking any liquidation, dissolution or winding up, and (vi) changing the size of the Board of Directors.\nUnder the Stockholders Agreement, Genstar Capital has the right, but not the obligation, to nominate (a) 50% of our directors, as long as Genstar Capital beneficially owns 50% or more of our outstanding common stock, (b) 40% of our directors, as long as Genstar Capital beneficially owns 40% or more, but less than 50% of our outstanding common stock, (c) 30% of our directors, as long as Genstar Capital beneficially owns 30% or more, but less than 40% of our outstanding common stock, (d) 20% of our directors, as long as Genstar Capital beneficially owns 20% or more, but less than 30% of our outstanding common stock, (e) 10% of our directors, as long as Genstar Capital beneficially owns 10% or more, but less than 20% of our outstanding common stock, in each case rounded up to the nearest whole number of directors. If Genstar Capital is able to exert significant influence over our Board of Directors as a result of their nomination rights pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, our other stockholders may have limited ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our other stockholders do not view as beneficial.\nAs a result of its ownership and the Stockholders Agreement, Genstar Capital is able to influence matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other extraordinary transactions. Genstar Capital may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. The concentration of ownership could deprive stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of our company and may ultimately affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, the requirement to obtain Genstar Capital\u2019s prior consent for certain transactions, including acquisitions and dispositions, may adversely impact our ability to operate our business or take advantage of certain opportunities.\nOur costs will increase significantly as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to complying with public company regulations.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, which require, among other things, that we file with the SEC annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition and therefore we need to have the ability to prepare financial statements that comply with all SEC reporting requirements on a timely basis. In addition, we are subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements, including certain requirements of and certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, which will impose significant compliance obligations upon us. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and, to the extent that we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our compliance with Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts. We currently do not have an internal audit group. We will need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge to satisfy the ongoing requirements of Section 404 and provide internal audit services.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as new rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq, have increased regulation of, and imposed enhanced disclosure and corporate governance requirements on, public companies. Our efforts to comply with these evolving laws, regulations and standards will increase our operating costs and divert management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities.\nThese changes will also place significant additional demands on our finance and accounting staff and on our financial accounting and information systems. We may need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company reporting experience and technical accounting knowledge. Other expenses associated with being a public company include increases in auditing, accounting and legal fees and expenses, investor relations expenses, increased directors\u2019 fees and director and officer liability insurance costs, registrar and transfer agent fees and listing fees, as well as other expenses. As a public company, we will be required, among other things, to:\n\u00b7\nprepare and file periodic reports and distribute other stockholder communications, in compliance with the federal securities laws and requirements of Nasdaq;\n\u00b7\ndefine and expand the roles and the duties of our Board of Directors and its committees;\n\u00b7\ninstitute more comprehensive compliance and investor relations functions; and\n\u00b7\nevaluate and maintain our system of internal control over financial reporting, and report on management\u2019s assessment thereof, in compliance with rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.\nWe may not be successful in implementing these requirements, and implementing them could materially adversely affect our business. The increased costs will decrease our net income and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products or services. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we\nmay be required to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, our Board committees or as executive officers.\nIn addition, if we fail to implement the required controls with respect to our internal accounting and audit functions, our ability to report our results of operations on a timely and accurate basis could be impaired. If we do not implement the required controls in a timely manner or with adequate compliance, we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC or Nasdaq. Any such action could harm our reputation and the confidence of investors in, and clients of, our company and could negatively affect our business and cause the price of our shares of common stock to decline.\nWe are required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to achieve and maintain effective internal controls, our operating results and financial condition could be harmed and the market price of our common stock may be negatively affected.\nAs a public company with SEC reporting obligations, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures to satisfy the requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which will require annual assessments by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting beginning with the annual report for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2019. We are an emerging growth company, and thus we are exempt from the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley until such time as we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. See also \u201cWe qualify as an emerging growth company, and any decision on our part to comply with reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\u201d Regardless of whether we qualify as an emerging growth company, we will still need to implement substantial internal control systems and procedures in order to satisfy the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act and applicable requirements.\nDuring the course of our assessment, we may identify deficiencies that we are unable to remediate in a timely manner. Testing and maintaining our internal control over financial reporting may also divert management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business. We may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley. If we conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, we cannot be certain as to the timing of completion of our evaluation, testing and remediation actions or their effect on our operations. Moreover, any material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting may impede our ability to file timely and accurate reports with the SEC. Any of the above could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information or our common stock listing on Nasdaq to be suspended or terminated, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe qualify as an emerging growth company, and any decision on our part to comply with reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and, for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we currently intend to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to have our independent registered public accounting firm audit our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our registration statements, periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: (i) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the IPO; (ii) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenue is $1.07 billion or more; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or (iv) the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.\nWe cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions while we are an emerging growth company. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be more volatile.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We plan to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we may not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nOur operating results and stock price may be volatile, or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and holders of our common stock could lose all or part of their investment.\nOur quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future as a publicly traded company. In addition, securities markets worldwide have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could subject the market price of our shares to wide price fluctuations regardless of our operating performance. You should consider an investment in our common stock to be risky, and you should invest in our common stock only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuation in the market value of your investment. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be subject to significant fluctuations in response to the factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u00b7\nmarket conditions in the broader stock market;\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial and operating results;\n\u00b7\nintroduction of new products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nissuance of new or changed securities analysts\u2019 reports or recommendations;\n\u00b7\nresults of operations that vary from expectations of securities analysis and investors;\n\u00b7\nshort sales, hedging and other derivative transactions in our common stock;\n\u00b7\nguidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance;\n\u00b7\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7\nannouncement by us, our competitors or our acquisition targets;\n\u00b7\nsales, or anticipated sales, of large blocks of our stock, including by our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures in our Board or Directors, senior management or other key personnel;\n\u00b7\nregulatory, legal or political developments;\n\u00b7\npublic response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u00b7\nlitigation and governmental investigations;\n\u00b7\nchanging economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting principles;\n\u00b7\nany indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future;\n\u00b7\ndefault under agreements governing our indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nexposure to capital and credit market risks that adversely affect our investment portfolio or our capital resources;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our credit ratings;\n\u00b7\nexchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u00b7\nother events or factors, including those from natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism or responses to these events.\nThe securities markets have from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of these factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price at which they purchased their shares. These broad market fluctuations, as well as general market, economic and political conditions, such as recessions, loss of investor confidence or interest rate changes, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, the stock markets, including Nasdaq, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to securities class action litigation that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend, divert management\u2019s attention and resources or harm our business.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that Genstar Capital has no obligation to offer us corporate opportunities.\nGenstar Capital and the members of our Board of Directors who are affiliated with Genstar Capital, by the terms of our certificate of incorporation, will not be required to offer us any corporate opportunity of which they become aware and could take any such opportunity for themselves or offer it to other companies in which they have an investment, unless such opportunity is expressly offered to them solely in their capacity as our directors. We, by the terms of our certificate of incorporation, expressly renounce any interest in any such corporate opportunity to the extent permitted under applicable law, even if the opportunity is one that we would reasonably be deemed to have pursued if given the opportunity to do so. Our certificate of incorporation cannot be amended to eliminate our renunciation of any such corporate opportunity arising prior to the date of any such amendment. Genstar Capital is in the business of making investments in portfolio companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete with us, and Genstar Capital has no obligation to refrain from acquiring competing businesses. Any competition could intensify if an affiliate or subsidiary of Genstar Capital were to enter into or acquire a business similar to ours. These potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects if attractive corporate opportunities are allocated by Genstar Capital to itself, its portfolio companies or its other affiliates instead of to us.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay a change in management and limit our share price.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us even if such a change in control would increase the value of our common stock and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current Board of Directors or management.\nOur charter documents contain anti-takeover provisions that will hinder takeover attempts and could reduce the market value of our common stock or prevent sale at a premium. Our anti-takeover provisions:\n\u00b7\npermit the Board of Directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;\n\u00b7\nprovide that our Board of Directors are classified into three classes with staggered, three year terms and that directors may only be removed for cause;\n\u00b7\nrequire super-majority voting to amend provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u00b7\ninclude blank-check preferred stock, the preference, rights and other terms of which may be set by the Board of Directors and could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise benefit our stockholders;\n\u00b7\neliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our Board of Directors, the chairman of our Board of Directors, or our chief executive officer;\n\u00b7\nprohibit stockholder action by other than unanimous written consent;\n\u00b7\nprovide that vacancies on our Board of Directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\u00b7\nprohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors; and\n\u00b7\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock (excluding Genstar Capital), from merging or combining with us for a period of time.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for the following civil actions:\n\u00b7\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u00b7\nany action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents or our stockholders;\n\u00b7\nany action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware;\n\u00b7\nany action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; or\n\u00b7\nany action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nHowever, this provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, this provision applies to Securities Act claims and Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Accordingly, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provision, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. This choice of forum provision, if enforced, may limit a stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business and our industry. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrades our common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nApplicable insurance laws may make it difficult to effect a change of control.\nUnder applicable Oregon and California insurance laws and regulations, no person may acquire control of a domestic insurer until written approval is obtained from the state insurance commissioner following a public hearing on the proposed acquisition. Such approval would be contingent upon the state insurance commissioner\u2019s consideration of a number of factors including, among others, the financial strength of the proposed acquiror, the acquiror\u2019s plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control. Oregon and California insurance laws and regulations pertaining to changes of control apply to both the direct and indirect acquisition of ten percent or more of the voting stock of an Oregon-domiciled or California-domiciled insurer. Accordingly, the acquisition of ten percent or more of our common stock would be considered an indirect change of control of Palomar Holdings, Inc. and would trigger the applicable change of control filing requirements under Oregon and California insurance laws and regulations, absent a disclaimer of control filing and its acceptance by the Oregon and California Insurance Departments. These requirements may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of Palomar Holdings, Inc., including through transactions that some or all of the stockholders of Palomar Holdings, Inc. might consider to be desirable.

The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors described in the section captioned \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K include additional factors that could adversely impact our business and financial performance.
