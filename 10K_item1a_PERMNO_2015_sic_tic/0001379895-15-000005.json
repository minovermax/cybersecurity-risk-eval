{"cik": "1379895", "company": "DYNEGY INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nPlease note that any risk, uncertainty or other factor that has a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of our IPH segment may not result in a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of Dynegy on a consolidated basis due to the relative size of the IPH segment as well as the ring-fenced structuring of IPH and its subsidiaries. However, you should review the risk factor regarding the IPH ring-fenced structure and the risk that a creditor of IPH, or a bankruptcy trustee if any entity of the IPH segment were to become a debtor in bankruptcy, may nevertheless be successful in subjecting Dynegy to the claims of IPH and its subsidiaries.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Form 10-K includes statements reflecting assumptions, expectations, projections, intentions or beliefs about future events that are intended as \u201cforward-looking statements.\u201d All statements included or incorporated by reference in this annual report, other than statements of historical fact, that address activities, events or developments that we expect, believe or anticipate will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. These statements represent our reasonable judgment of the future based on various factors and using numerous assumptions and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause our actual results and financial position to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cforecast,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cexpect\u201d and other words of similar meaning. In particular, these include, but are not limited to, statements relating to the following:\n\u2022\nbeliefs and assumptions about weather and general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nbeliefs, assumptions and projections regarding the demand for power, generation volumes and commodity pricing, including natural gas prices and the timing of a recovery in natural gas prices, if any;\n\u2022\nbeliefs and assumptions about market competition, generation capacity and regional supply and demand characteristics of the wholesale and retail power markets, including the anticipation of plant retirements and higher market pricing over the longer term;\n\u2022\nsufficiency of, access to and costs associated with coal, fuel oil and natural gas inventories and transportation thereof;\n\u2022\nthe effects of, or changes to, MISO, PJM, CAISO, NYISO or ISO-NE power and capacity procurement processes;\n\u2022\nexpectations regarding environmental matters, including costs of compliance, availability and adequacy of emission credits and the impact of ongoing proceedings and potential regulations or changes to current regulations, including those relating to climate change, air emissions, cooling water intake structures, coal combustion byproducts and other laws and regulations to which we are, or could become, subject;\n\u2022\nbeliefs about the outcome of legal, administrative, legislative and regulatory matters;\n\u2022\nprojected operating or financial results, including anticipated cash flows from operations, revenues and profitability;\n\u2022\nour focus on safety and our ability to efficiently operate our assets so as to capture revenue generating opportunities and operating margins;\n\u2022\nour ability to mitigate forced outage risk as we become subject to proposed capacity performance in PJM and new performance incentives in ISO-NE;\n\u2022\nour ability to optimize our assets through targeted investment in cost effective technology enhancements;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our strategies to capture opportunities presented by changes in commodity prices and to manage our exposure to energy price volatility;\n\u2022\nefforts to secure retail sales and the ability to grow the retail business;\n\u2022\nefforts to identify opportunities to reduce congestion and improve busbar power prices;\n\u2022\nability to mitigate impacts associated with expiring RMR and/or capacity contracts;\n\u2022\nexpectations regarding our compliance with the Credit Agreement, including collateral demands, interest expense, any applicable financial ratios and other payments;\n\u2022\nexpectations regarding performance standards and capital and maintenance expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe timing and anticipated benefits to be achieved through our company-wide improvement programs, including our PRIDE initiative;\n\u2022\nexpectations regarding the synergies, financing, completion, timing, terms and anticipated benefits of the Pending Acquisitions;\n\u2022\nbeliefs about the costs and scope of the ongoing demolition and site remediation efforts at the South Bay and Vermilion facilities;\n\u2022\nthe strategic evaluation of our California assets; and\n\u2022\nbeliefs regarding redevelopment efforts for the Morro Bay facility.\nAny or all of our forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those set forth below.\nFACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS\nRisks Related to the Operation of Our Business\nBecause wholesale and retail power prices are subject to significant volatility and because many of our power generation facilities operate without long-term power sales agreements, our revenues and profitability are subject to wide fluctuations.\nThe majority of our facilities operate as \u201cmerchant\u201d facilities without long-term power sales agreements. As a result, we largely sell electric energy, capacity and ancillary services into the wholesale energy spot market or into other wholesale and retail power markets on a short-term basis and are not guaranteed any rate of return on our capital investments. Consequently, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell any or all of the electric energy, capacity or ancillary services from those facilities at commercially attractive rates or that our facilities will be able to operate profitably. We depend, in large part, upon prevailing market prices for power, capacity and fuel. Given the volatility of commodity power prices, to the extent we do not secure long-term power sales agreements for the output of our power generation facilities, our revenues and profitability will be subject to volatility, and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Factors that may materially impact the power markets and our financial results include:\n\u2022\naddition of new supplies of power from existing competitors or new market entrants as a result of the development of new generation plants, expansion of existing plants or additional transmission capacity;\n\u2022\nenvironmental regulations and legislation;\n\u2022\nweather conditions, including extreme weather conditions and seasonal fluctuations;\n\u2022\nelectric supply disruptions including plant outages;\n\u2022\nbasis risk from transmission losses and congestion and changes in power transmission infrastructure;\n\u2022\ndevelopment of new technologies for the production of natural gas;\n\u2022\nfuel price volatility;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions;\n\u2022\nincreased competition or price pressure driven by generation from renewable sources;\n\u2022\nregulatory constraints on pricing (current or future), including RTO and ISO rules, policies and actions, or the functioning of the energy trading markets and energy trading generally;\n\u2022\nthe existence and effectiveness of demand-side management; and\n\u2022\nconservation efforts and the extent to which they impact electricity demand.\nOur commercial strategies for our wholesale and retail businesses may not be executed as planned, may result in lost opportunities or adversely affect financial performance.\nWe seek to commercialize our assets through sales arrangements of various types. In doing so, we attempt to balance a desire for greater predictability of earnings and cash flows in the short- and medium-terms with our expectation that commodity prices will rise over the longer term, creating upside opportunities for those with unhedged generation volumes. Our ability to successfully execute this strategy is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are outside our control, including market liquidity and design, correlation risk, commodity price cycles, the availability of counterparties willing to transact with us or to transact with us at prices we think are commercially acceptable, the availability of liquidity to post collateral in support of our derivative instruments and the reliability of the systems and models comprising our commercial operations function. The availability of market liquidity and willing counterparties could be negatively impacted by poor economic and financial market conditions, including impacts on financial institutions and other current and potential counterparties as well as counterparties\u2019 views of our creditworthiness. If we are unable to transact in the short- and medium-terms, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be subject to significant uncertainty and volatility. Alternatively, significant power sales for any such period may precede a run-up in commodity prices, resulting in lost up-side opportunities.\nFurther, financial performance may be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively manage our power portfolio. A portion of the generation power portfolio is used to provide power to wholesale and retail customers. To the extent portions of the power portfolio are not needed for that purpose, generation output is sold in the wholesale market. To the extent our power portfolio is not sufficient to meet the requirements of our customers, we must purchase power in the wholesale power markets.\nOur financial results may be negatively affected if we are unable to manage the power portfolio and cost-effectively meet the requirements of our customers.\nA decline in market liquidity and our ability to manage our counterparty credit risk could adversely affect us.\nOur supplier counterparties may experience deteriorating credit. These conditions could cause counterparties in the natural gas, coal and power markets, particularly in the energy commodity derivative markets that we rely on for our hedging activities, to withdraw from participation in those markets. If multiple parties withdraw from those markets, market liquidity may be threatened, which in turn could adversely impact our business. Additionally, these conditions may cause our counterparties to seek bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 or liquidation under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Our credit risk may be exacerbated to the extent collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount due to us. There can be no assurance that any such losses or impairments to the carrying value of our financial assets would not materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, retail sales subject us to credit risk through competitive electricity supply activities to serve commercial and industrial companies and governmental entities. Retail credit risk results when customers default on their contractual obligations. This risk represents the loss that may be incurred due to the nonpayment of a customer\u2019s account balance, as well as the loss from the resale of energy previously committed to serve that customer, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fuel and fuel transportation cost increases and interruptions in fuel supplies.\nWe purchase the fuel requirements for many of our power generation facilities, primarily those that are natural gas-fired, under short-term contracts or on the spot market. As a result, we face the risks of supply interruptions and fuel price volatility, as fuel deliveries may not exactly match those required for energy sales.\nMoreover, profitable operation of many of our coal-fired generation facilities is highly dependent on coal prices and coal transportation rates. We mitigate our price exposure to coal and related transportation by entering into long-term contracts. Transportation of coal can also be affected by rail equipment availability, extreme weather or natural disasters, each of which may slow or stop the delivery from the mine to the facility.\nFurther, any changes in the costs of Powder River Basin coal, fuel oil, natural gas or transportation rates and changes in the relationship between such costs and the market prices of power will affect our financial results. If we are unable to procure fuel for physical delivery at prices we consider favorable, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nThe concentration of our existing business in Illinois and the MISO market increases the effects of any adverse conditions in Illinois and MISO and any disruption of production at our Gas segment could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA substantial portion of our business is located in Illinois and MISO where more than 50 percent of our current plant capacity is located. Further, natural disasters in Illinois and changes in economic conditions in MISO, including changing demographics, congestion, or oversupply of or reduced demand for power, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, a substantial portion of our Gas segment gross margin is derived from three of our facilities, Kendall, Ontelaunee and Independence. Any disruption of production at these facilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOperation of power generation facilities involves significant risks customary to the power industry that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe ongoing operation of our facilities involves risks customary to the power industry that include the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, operational and safety performance below expected levels and the inability to transport our product to customers in an efficient manner due to a lack of transmission capacity. Unplanned outages of generating units, including extensions of scheduled outages due to mechanical failures or other problems, occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of our business. Further, the majority of our facilities are old and require periodic upgrading and improvement. Any unexpected failure, including failure associated with breakdowns, forced outages or any unanticipated capital expenditures, could result in reduced profitability, or with respect to capacity performance, penalties. Unplanned outages typically increase our operation and maintenance expenses and may reduce our revenues as a result of selling fewer MW or require us to incur significant costs as a result of running one of our higher cost units or obtaining replacement power from third parties in the open market to satisfy our forward power sales obligations. If we are unsuccessful in operating our facilities efficiently, such inefficiency could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur costs of compliance with existing environmental requirements are significant, and costs of compliance with new environmental requirements or factors could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is subject to extensive and frequently changing environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities. Such environmental regulation imposes, among other things, capital and operating expenditures, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of substances and waste, including CCR, and in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances (including carbon emissions) into the environment, as well as environmental impacts associated with cooling water intake structures. Existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted, new laws and regulations may be adopted or may become applicable to us or our facilities, and litigation or enforcement proceedings could be commenced against us. Proposals being considered by federal and state authorities (including proposals regarding cooling water intake structures and carbon) could, if and when adopted or enacted, require us to make substantial capital and operating expenditures or consider retiring certain of our facilities. If any of these events occur, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nMany environmental laws require approvals or permits from governmental authorities before construction, modification or operation of a power generation facility may commence. Certain environmental permits must be renewed periodically in order for us to continue operating our facilities. The process of obtaining and renewing necessary permits can be lengthy and complex and can sometimes result in the establishment of permit conditions that make the project or activity for which the permit was sought unprofitable or otherwise unattractive. Even where permits are not required, compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant capital and operating expenditures. We are required to comply with numerous environmental laws and regulations, and to obtain numerous governmental permits when we modify and operate our facilities. If there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals or permits, if we fail to obtain any required approval or permit, or if we are unable to comply with the terms of such approvals or permits, the operation of our facilities may be interrupted or become subject to additional costs and/or legal challenges. Further, changed interpretations of existing regulations may subject historical maintenance, repair and replacement activities at our facilities to claims of noncompliance. With the continuing trend toward stricter environmental standards and more extensive regulatory and permitting requirements, our capital and operating environmental expenditures are likely to be substantial and may significantly increase in the future. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to complex government regulation. Changes in these regulations or in their implementation may affect costs of operating our facilities or our ability to operate our facilities, or increase competition, any of which would negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the generation and sale of energy commodities in each of the jurisdictions in which we have operations. Compliance with these ever-changing laws and regulations requires expenses (including legal representation) and monitoring, capital and operating expenditures. Potential changes in laws and regulations that could have a material impact on our business include: the introduction, or reintroduction, of rate caps or pricing constraints; increased credit standards, collateral costs or margin requirements, as well as reduced market liquidity, as a result of potential OTC market regulation; or a variation of these. Furthermore, these and other market-based rules and regulations are subject to change at any time, and we cannot predict what changes may occur in the future or how such changes might affect any facet of our business.\nThe costs and burdens associated with complying with the increased number of regulations may have a material adverse effect on us if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations governing our business or if we fail to maintain or obtain advantageous regulatory authorizations and exemptions. Failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of any noncompliant facility, the imposition of liens or fines, or civil or criminal liability. Moreover, increased competition within the sector resulting from potential legislative changes, regulatory changes or other factors may create greater risks to the stability of our power generation earnings and cash flows generally.\nAvailability and cost of emission allowances could materially impact our costs of operations.\nWe are required to maintain, either through allocation or purchase, sufficient emission allowances to support our operations in the ordinary course of operating our power generation facilities. These allowances are used to meet our obligations imposed by various applicable environmental laws, and the trend toward more stringent regulations (including regulations regarding GHG emissions) will likely require us to obtain new or additional emission allowances. If our operational needs require more than our allocated quantity of emission allowances, we may be forced to purchase such allowances on the open market, which could be costly. If we are unable to maintain sufficient emission allowances to match our operational needs, we may have to curtail our operations so as not to exceed our available emission allowances, or install costly new emissions controls. As we use the emissions allowances that we have purchased on the open market, costs associated with such purchases will be recognized as an operating expense. If such allowances are available for purchase, but only at significantly higher prices, their purchase could materially\nincrease our costs of operations in the affected markets and materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCompetition in wholesale and retail power markets, together with the age of certain of our generation facilities, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur power generation business competes with other non-utility generators, regulated utilities, unregulated subsidiaries of regulated utilities, other energy service companies and financial institutions in the sale of electric energy, capacity and ancillary services, as well as in the procurement of fuel, transmission and transportation services. Moreover, aggregate demand for power may be met by generation capacity based on several competing technologies, as well as power generating facilities fueled by alternative or renewable energy sources, including hydroelectric power, synthetic fuels, solar, wind, wood, geothermal, waste heat and solid waste sources. Regulatory initiatives designed to enhance and/or subsidize renewable generation could increase competition from these types of facilities.\nWe also compete against other energy merchants on the basis of our relative operating skills, financial position and access to credit sources. Electric energy customers, wholesale energy suppliers and transporters often seek financial guarantees, credit support such as letters of credit, and other assurances that their energy contracts will be satisfied. Companies with which we compete may have greater resources in these areas. In addition, certain of our current facilities are relatively old. Newer plants owned by competitors may be more efficient than some of our plants, which may put these plants at a competitive disadvantage. Over time, some of our plants may become unable to compete because of the construction of new plants, and such new plants could have a number of advantages including: more efficient equipment, newer technology that could result in fewer emissions or more advantageous locations on the electric transmission system. Additionally, these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new laws and regulations because of the newer technology utilized in their facilities or the additional resources derived from owning more efficient facilities. Taken as a whole, the potential disadvantages of our aging fleet could result in lower run-times or even early asset retirement.\nOther factors may contribute to increased competition in wholesale power markets. New forms of capital and competitors have entered the industry, including financial investors who perceive that asset values are at levels below their true replacement value. As a result, a number of generation facilities in the U.S. are now owned by lenders and investment companies. Furthermore, mergers and asset reallocations in the industry could create powerful new competitors. Under any scenario, we anticipate that we will face competition from numerous companies in the industry.\nIn addition, the retail marketing activities compete for customers in a competitive environment, which impacts the margins that we can earn on the volumes we are able to serve. Further, with retail competition, residential customers where we serve load can switch to and from competitive electric generation suppliers for their energy needs. If fewer customers switch to another supplier than anticipated, the load we must serve will be greater and, if market prices have increased, our costs will increase due to the need to go to the market to cover the incremental supply obligation. If more customers switch to another supplier than anticipated, the load we must serve will be lower and, if market prices have decreased, we could lose opportunities in the market. To the extent that competition increases, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nGenerally, we do not own or control transmission facilities required to sell the wholesale power from our generation facilities. If the transmission service is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver wholesale power may be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, RTOs and ISOs administer the transmission infrastructure and market, which are subject to changes in structure and operation and impose various pricing limitations. These changes and pricing limitations may affect our ability to deliver power to the market that would, in turn, adversely affect the profitability of our generation facilities.\nWith the exception of EEI, which owns and controls transmission lines interconnecting the Joppa facility in EEI\u2019s control area to MISO, TVA and Louisville Gas and Electric Company (\u201cLGE\u201d), we do not own or control the transmission facilities required to deliver the power from our generation facilities to the market. If the transmission service from these facilities is unavailable or disrupted, or if the transmission capacity infrastructure is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver wholesale power may be materially adversely affected. RTOs and ISOs provide transmission services, administer transparent and competitive power markets and maintain system reliability. Many of these RTOs and ISOs operate in the real-time and day-ahead markets in which we sell energy. The RTOs and ISOs that oversee most of the wholesale power markets impose price limitations, offer caps, capacity performance requirements, penalties, and other mechanisms to guard against the potential exercise of market power in these markets. Price limitations and other regulatory mechanisms may adversely affect the profitability of our generation facilities that sell energy and capacity into the wholesale power markets. Problems or delays that may arise in the formation and operation of maturing RTOs and similar market structures, or changes in geographic scope, rules or market operations of existing RTOs, may also affect our ability to sell, the prices we receive or the cost to transmit power produced by our generating facilities. Market design as well as rules governing the various regional power markets may also change from time to time, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Retail business is subject to the risk that sensitive customer data may be compromised, which could result in an adverse impact to our reputation and/or the results of operations of the Retail business.\nThe Retail business requires access to sensitive customer data in the ordinary course of business. Examples of sensitive customer data are names, addresses, account information, historical electricity usage, expected patterns of use, payment history, credit bureau data and bank account information. The Retail business may need to provide sensitive customer data to vendors and service providers who require access to this information in order to provide services, such as call center operations, to the Retail business. If a significant breach occurred, our reputation may be adversely affected, customer confidence may be diminished or we may be subject to legal claims, any of which may contribute to the loss of customers and have a negative impact on our business and/or financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nUnauthorized hedging and related activities by our employees could result in significant losses.\nWe intend to continue our commercial strategy, which emphasizes forward power sales opportunities intended to reduce the market price exposure of the Company to power price declines. We have various internal policies and procedures designed to monitor hedging activities and positions. These policies and procedures are designed, in part, to prevent unauthorized purchases or sales of products by our employees. We cannot assure, however, that these steps will detect and prevent all violations of our risk management policies and procedures, particularly if deception or other intentional misconduct is involved. A significant policy violation that is not detected could result in a substantial financial loss for us.\nOur risk management policies cannot fully eliminate the risk associated with our commodity hedging activities.\nOur asset-based power position as well as our power marketing, fuel procurement and other commodity hedging activities expose us to risks of commodity price movements. We attempt to manage this exposure through enforcement of established risk limits and risk management procedures. These risk limits and risk management procedures may not work as planned and cannot eliminate all risks associated with these activities. Even when our policies and procedures are followed, and decisions are made based on projections and estimates of future performance, results of operations may be diminished if the judgments and assumptions underlying those decisions prove to be incorrect. Factors, such as future prices and demand for power and other energy-related commodities, become more difficult to predict and the calculations become less reliable the further into the future estimates are made. As a result, we cannot fully predict the impact that our commodity hedging activities and risk management decisions may have on our business and/or financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nStrikes, work stoppages or an inability to negotiate future collective bargaining agreements on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA majority of the employees at our facilities are subject to collective bargaining agreements with various unions. Additionally, unionization activities, including votes for union certification, could occur at the non-union generating facilities in our fleet. If union employees strike, participate in a work stoppage or slowdown or engage in other forms of labor strike or disruption, we could experience reduced power generation or outages if replacement labor is not procured. The ability to procure such replacement labor is uncertain. Strikes, work stoppages or an inability to negotiate future collective bargaining agreements on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe IPH segment\u2019s ring-fencing structure may not work as planned and Dynegy may be subject to the claims of the creditors of IPH and its subsidiaries.\nIn connection with the acquisition of New Ameren Energy Resources, LLC (\u201cAER\u201d) and its subsidiaries (the \u201cAER Acquisition\u201d), IPH and its direct and indirect subsidiaries were organized into ring-fenced groups. The entities within the IPH ring-fenced structure maintain corporate separateness from our other current legal entities. This structure was implemented, in part, to minimize the risk that creditors of IPH, or a bankruptcy trustee if any entity of the IPH segment were to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case, would attempt to assert claims against Dynegy for payment of IPH\u2019s obligations. We believe the ring-fenced structure should preclude any corporate veil-piercing or other similar claims of IPH\u2019s creditors but, if any such claims were successful, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We also believe the ring-fenced structure should preclude any bankruptcy court from ordering the substantive consolidation of Dynegy\u2019s assets and liabilities with the assets and liabilities of any IPH debtor in bankruptcy. However, bankruptcy courts have broad equitable powers and, as a result, outcomes in bankruptcy proceedings are inherently difficult to predict. To the extent a bankruptcy court were to determine that substantive consolidation was appropriate under the facts and circumstances, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nTerrorist attacks and/or cyber-attacks may result in our inability to operate and fulfill our obligations, and could result in material repair costs.\nAs a power generator, we face heightened risk of terrorism, including cyber terrorism, either by a direct act against one or more of our generating facilities or an act against the transmission and distribution infrastructure that is used to transport our power. We rely on information technology networks and systems to operate our generating facilities, engage in asset management activities, and process, transmit and store electronic information. Security breaches of this information technology infrastructure, including cyber-attacks and cyber terrorism, could lead to system disruptions, generating facility shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information related to our employees, vendors and counterparties, including retail counterparties.\nSystemic damage to one or more of our generating facilities and/or to the transmission and distribution infrastructure could result in our inability to operate in one or all of the markets we serve for an extended period of time. If our generating facilities are shut down, we would be unable to respond to the ISOs and RTOs or fulfill our obligations under various energy and/or capacity arrangements, resulting in lost revenues and potential fines, penalties and other liabilities. Pervasive cyber-attacks across our industry could affect the ability of ISOs and RTOs to function in some regions. The cost to restore our generating facilities after such an occurrence could be material.\nRisks Related to the Pending Acquisitions\nWe may be unable to obtain the regulatory approvals (timely or at all) required to complete one or both of the Pending Acquisitions or, in order to do so, we may be required to comply with material restrictions on our conduct or satisfy other material conditions required by various regulatory authorities.\nConsummation of the Pending Acquisitions is subject to conditions and governmental approvals, including FERC approval. The closing of each of the Pending Acquisitions is also subject to the condition that there be no injunction or order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction that prevents the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the acquisition agreements. Each Pending Acquisition purchase agreement and related financing contains dates by which all the terms and conditions (including FERC approval) must be satisfied or the applicable transactions may be terminated. We can provide no assurance that all required regulatory approvals will be obtained in a timely manner or at all. There can also be no assurance as to the cost, scope or impact of the actions that may be required to obtain the required regulatory approvals. Furthermore, these actions could have the effect of delaying or preventing completion of the Pending Acquisitions or imposing additional costs, including costs and expenses to maintain our financing, conditions or restrictions on our business and operations, some of which could be material and adversely affect our revenues and profitability following the consummation of the Pending Acquisitions. Further, even if the Pending Acquisitions are consummated, they may not be consummated in the time frame, on the terms or in the manner currently anticipated. There can be no assurance that the conditions to closing of the Pending Acquisitions will be satisfied or waived or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to close the Pending Acquisitions.\nFurthermore, the FERC or other governmental authorities could seek to block or challenge the Pending Acquisitions as they deem necessary or desirable in the public interest at any time, including after completion of the transactions. In addition, in some circumstances, a competitor, customer or other third party could initiate a private action under antitrust laws challenging or seeking to enjoin either or both of the Pending Acquisitions, before or after either or both of them are consummated. We may not prevail and may incur significant costs in defending or settling any action under the antitrust laws.\nIf one or both of the Pending Acquisitions are consummated, we may be unable to successfully integrate the operations with our existing operations or to realize targeted cost savings, revenues and other anticipated benefits of the Pending Acquisitions.\nThe success of the Pending Acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from integrating the Duke Midwest assets and/or the EquiPower assets with our existing business. We may be required to make unanticipated capital expenditures or investments in order to maintain, integrate, improve or sustain our operations, or take unexpected write-offs or impairment charges resulting from the Pending Acquisitions. Further, we may be subject to unanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to the Pending Acquisitions. If any of these factors occur or limit our ability to integrate the businesses successfully or on a timely basis, the expectations of our future financial condition and results of operations on a combined basis following the Pending Acquisitions might not be met.\nIt is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses, inefficiencies, or inconsistencies in standards, controls, systems, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Pending Acquisitions and could adversely impact our financial performance.\nWe continue to evaluate and refine our estimates of synergies to be realized from the Pending Acquisitions. Actual cost-savings, including the costs required to realize the cost-savings and the source of the cost-savings, could differ materially from our estimates.\nFinally, we may not be able to achieve the targeted operating or long-term strategic benefits of the Pending Acquisitions. If the combined businesses are not able to achieve our objectives, or are not able to achieve our objectives on a timely basis, the anticipated benefits of the Pending Acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all and could have an adverse effect on our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe will incur significant costs in connection with the Pending Acquisitions.\nWe expect to incur significant costs associated with the Pending Acquisitions, including costs related to obtaining required governmental approvals, maintaining our financing and combining the operations of our company with the Duke Midwest assets and the EquiPower assets, including costs to achieve targeted cost-savings. The substantial majority of the expenses resulting from the Pending Acquisitions will be composed of transaction costs, systems consolidation costs, and business integration and employment-related costs, including costs for severance, retention and other restructuring. Additionally, we are currently incurring significant interest costs related to the financing for the Pending Acquisitions but are not yet realizing the increased revenues and cash flows that we expect upon closing of the Pending Acquisitions. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our and the acquired companies\u2019 businesses. Even if we consummate the Pending Acquisitions, the anticipated elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies, may not be achieved in the near-term, or at all, in an amount equal to or greater than the related costs.\nDisruptions in our, Duke Midwest assets\u2019 and EquiPower assets\u2019 operations could occur prior to the closing of the Pending Acquisitions.\nDisruptions in our, Duke Midwest assets\u2019 and EquiPower assets\u2019 operations could occur prior to the closing of the Pending Acquisitions. Specifically:\n\u2022\nour, Duke Midwest assets\u2019 and EquiPower assets\u2019 current and prospective customers and suppliers may experience uncertainty associated with the Pending Acquisitions, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us, Duke Midwest assets, EquiPower assets or the combined company business and may attempt to negotiate changes in existing business;\n\u2022\nthe Pending Acquisitions may give rise to potential liabilities; and\n\u2022\nif the EquiPower Acquisition is consummated, the accelerated vesting of equity-based awards and payment of \u201cchange in control\u201d benefits to some members of EquiPower assets\u2019 management upon consummation of the EquiPower Acquisition could result in increased difficulty or cost in retaining EquiPower assets\u2019 officers and employees.\nAny of the above disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn the event that either of the Pending Acquisitions are not consummated or certain escrow account criteria are not satisfied within certain timeframes, we may have to seek alternative financing.\nIn the event that either Pending Acquisition is not consummated substantially in accordance with the terms and conditions of the relevant purchase agreement, or any of the other conditions to release the escrow account are not satisfied by May 11, 2015 (with respect to the EquiPower Acquisition) or August 24, 2015 (with respect to the Duke Midwest Acquisition), or the applicable purchase agreement, is terminated, or if on the date that is five business days prior to the last business day of any calendar month the funds in an escrow account (as calculated by the applicable Escrow Issuer (as defined herein)) would not be sufficient to fund a special mandatory redemption at the end of the following month, the applicable Escrow Issuer will be obligated to use the funds in the particular escrow account to redeem all of the associated Notes at a redemption price equal to 100 percent of the issue price of such Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Please read Note 11-Debt for further discussion.\nFurther, in the event that we fail to close either of the Pending Acquisitions by the applicable deadline, resulting in a special mandatory redemption of the Notes, we may be unable to obtain alternative financing to fund the relevant Pending Acquisition or obtain such financing on terms that are acceptable to us. Specifically, if the applicable Escrow Issuer is required to redeem all of the associated Notes with the funds in the relevant escrow accounts it will not impact the escrow account of the other Escrow Issuer; however, we will be required to find alternative financing to fund the applicable Pending Acquisition. In addition, in the event that the financing contemplated by the Revolvers is not available, other alternative financing may not be available on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all. If alternative financing becomes necessary and we are unable to secure such additional financing, the relevant Pending Acquisition may not be completed.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Structure\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our ability in the future to raise additional capital to fund our operations. It could also expose us to the risk of increased interest rates and limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry as well as impact our cash available for distribution.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $7.2 billion of total indebtedness and approximately $249 million of indebtedness net of cash and restricted cash of $1.9 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively. We have secured commitments for two Revolvers totaling $950 million, each of which is expected to close upon consummation of the respective Pending Acquisition, and we completed the issuance of $5.1 billion in Notes which were placed into escrow pending the consummation of the Pending Acquisitions. Our debt could have negative consequences for our financial condition including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, including the Notes held in escrow, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to enter into long-term power sales or fuel purchases which require credit support;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to fund operations or future acquisitions;\n\u2022\nrestricting our ability to make certain distributions with respect to our capital stock and the ability of our subsidiaries to make certain distributions to us, in light of restricted payment and other financial covenants in our credit facilities and other financing agreements;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital including collateral postings, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may have less debt.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. Furthermore, we may be unable to refinance or replace our existing indebtedness on favorable terms or at all upon the expiration or termination thereof. Our failure to obtain additional capital or enter into new or replacement financing arrangements when due may constitute a default under such existing indebtedness and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur existing credit facilities contain, and agreements we enter into in the future may contain, covenants that could restrict our financial flexibility.\nOur existing credit facilities contain covenants imposing certain requirements on our business. These requirements may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise and may adversely affect the conduct of our current business, including restricting our ability to finance future operations and capital needs and limiting our ability to engage in other business activities. These covenants could place restrictions on our ability and the ability of our operating subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\ndeclare or pay dividends, repurchase or redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders;\n\u2022\nincur additional debt or issue some types of preferred shares;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmake certain restricted investments;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into any agreements which limit the ability of certain subsidiaries to make dividends or otherwise transfer cash or assets to us or certain other subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nsell or transfer assets; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate or merge.\nAgreements we enter into in the future may also have similar or more restrictive covenants. A breach of any covenant in the existing credit facilities or the agreements governing our other indebtedness would result in a default. A default, if not waived, could result in acceleration of the debt outstanding under any such agreement and in a default with respect to, and acceleration of, the debt outstanding under any other debt agreements. The accelerated debt would become due and payable immediately. If that should occur, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance our debt obligations. Even if new financing were then available, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us.", "PERMNO": 90352, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "DYN.2"}
