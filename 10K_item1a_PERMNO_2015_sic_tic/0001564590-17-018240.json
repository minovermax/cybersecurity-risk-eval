Risk Factors\nMany of the factors that affect UNIFI\u2019s business and operations involve risk and uncertainty. The factors described below are some of the risks that could materially negatively affect UNIFI\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. You should consider all such risks in evaluating UNIFI or making any investment decision involving UNIFI.\nUNIFI faces intense competition from a number of domestic and foreign yarn producers and importers of textile and apparel products. Because UNIFI and the supply chains in which UNIFI operates do not typically operate on the basis of long-term contracts with textile and apparel customers, these competitive factors could cause UNIFI\u2019s customers to shift rapidly to other producers.\nUNIFI competes not only against domestic and foreign yarn producers, but also against importers of foreign-sourced fabric and apparel into the United States and other countries in which UNIFI does business (particularly in Brazil with respect to commodity yarn products). The primary competitive factors in the textile industry include price, quality, product styling and differentiation, brand reputation, flexibility of production and finishing, delivery time and customer service. The needs of certain customers and the characteristics of particular products determine the relative importance of these various factors. A large number of UNIFI\u2019s foreign competitors have significant competitive advantages that may include lower labor and raw materials costs, government subsidies and favorable foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar. If any of these advantages increase, or if new and/or larger competitors emerge in the future, or if UNIFI\u2019s brand reputation is detrimentally impacted, then UNIFI\u2019s products could become less competitive, and its sales and profits may decrease as a result. In particular, devaluation of the Chinese currency against the U.S. Dollar could result in UNIFI\u2019s products becoming less competitive from a pricing standpoint and/or could result in the regions covered by NAFTA and CAFTA-DR losing market share to Chinese imports, thereby adversely impacting UNIFI\u2019s sales and profits. Also, while these foreign competitors have traditionally focused on commodity production, they are now increasingly focused on PVA products, where UNIFI has been able to generate higher margins. UNIFI may not be able to continue to compete effectively with imported foreign-made textile and apparel products, which would materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nSignificant price volatility of UNIFI\u2019s raw materials and rising energy costs may result in increased production costs, which UNIFI may not be able to pass on to its customers or may only be able to pass on with a time lag that adversely affects UNIFI during one or more periods.\nA significant portion of UNIFI\u2019s raw materials are derived from petroleum-based chemicals. The prices for petroleum and petroleum-related products and energy costs are volatile and dependent on global supply and demand dynamics, including geo-political risks. While UNIFI enters into raw material supply agreements from time to time, these agreements typically provide index pricing based on quoted market prices. Therefore, supply agreements provide only limited protection against price volatility. While UNIFI has, at times in the past, been able to increase\nsales prices in response to increased raw material costs, UNIFI has not always been able to do so. UNIFI has lost in the past (and expects that it may lose in the future) customers to its competitors as a result of price increases. In addition, competitors may be able to obtain raw materials at a lower cost due to market regulations that favor local producers in certain foreign locations where UNIFI operates, and certain other market regulations that favor UNIFI over other producers may be amended or repealed. Additionally, inflation can have a long-term impact by increasing the costs of materials, labor and/or energy, any of which costs may adversely impact UNIFI\u2019s ability to maintain satisfactory margins. If UNIFI is not able to fully pass on such cost increases to customers in a timely manner (or if it loses a large number of customers to competitors as a result of price increases), the result could be material and adverse to its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nDepending on the price volatility of UNIFI\u2019s petroleum-based raw materials, the price gap between virgin raw materials and recycled bottle flake could make virgin raw materials more cost-effective than recycled raw materials, which could result in an adverse effect on UNIFI\u2019s ability to sell its REPREVE\u00ae brand recycled products profitably.\nUNIFI depends upon limited sources for certain of its raw materials, and interruptions in supply could increase its costs of production, cause production inefficiencies or lead to a halt in production.\nUNIFI depends on a limited number of third parties for certain raw material supplies, such as POY, Chip and recycled plastic bottles. Although alternative sources of raw materials exist, UNIFI may not be able to obtain adequate supplies of such materials on acceptable terms, or at all, from other sources. UNIFI is dependent on NAFTA, CAFTA-DR and Berry Amendment qualified suppliers of raw materials for the production of Compliant Yarns. These suppliers are also at risk with their raw material supply chains. Any significant disruption or curtailment in the supply of any of its raw materials could cause UNIFI to reduce or cease its production for an extended period, or require UNIFI to increase its pricing, any of which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nUNIFI has significant foreign operations, and its consolidated results of operations may be adversely affected by the risks associated with doing business in foreign locations, including the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nUNIFI has operations in Brazil, China, Colombia, El Salvador and Sri Lanka, and participates in a joint venture located in Israel. UNIFI serves customers throughout the Americas and Asia, as well as various countries in Europe. UNIFI\u2019s foreign operations are subject to certain political, tax, economic and other uncertainties not encountered by its domestic operations that can materially impact UNIFI\u2019s supply chains or other aspects of its foreign operations. The risks of international operations include trade barriers, duties, exchange controls, national and regional labor strikes, social and political unrest, general economic risks, compliance with a variety of foreign laws (including tax laws), the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems, taxes on distributions or deemed distributions to UNIFI or any of its U.S. subsidiaries, maintenance of minimum capital requirements, and import and export controls. UNIFI\u2019s results of operations and business could be adversely affected as a result of a significant adverse development with respect to any of these risks.\nThrough its foreign operations, UNIFI is also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will impact period-to-period comparisons of UNIFI\u2019s reported results. Additionally, UNIFI operates in countries with foreign exchange controls. These controls may limit UNIFI\u2019s ability to transfer funds from its international operations and joint venture or otherwise to convert local currencies into U.S. Dollars. These limitations could adversely affect UNIFI\u2019s ability to access cash from these operations.\nIn addition, due to its foreign operations, a risk exists that UNIFI\u2019s employees, contractors or agents could engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws applicable to the Company, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the laws and regulations of other countries, such as the Brazilian Clean Companies Act. UNIFI maintains policies prohibiting these practices, but it remains subject to the risk that one or more of its employees, contractors or agents, specifically ones based in or from countries where such practices are customary, will engage in business practices in violation of these laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if in breach of UNIFI\u2019s policies, could adversely affect its business or financial performance.\nUNIFI\u2019s future success will depend in part on its ability to protect its intellectual property rights, and UNIFI\u2019s inability to enforce these rights could cause it to lose sales, reduce any competitive advantage it has developed or otherwise harm its business.\nUNIFI\u2019s success depends in part upon its ability to protect and preserve its rights in the trademarks and other intellectual property it owns or licenses, including its proprietary know-how, methods and processes, and the intellectual property related to its REPREVE\u00ae brand. UNIFI relies on the trademark, copyright and trade secret laws of the United States and other countries, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, to protect its intellectual property rights. However, UNIFI may be unable to prevent third parties, employees or contractors from using its intellectual property without authorization, breaching nondisclosure or confidentiality agreements, or independently developing technology that is similar to UNIFI\u2019s. The use of UNIFI\u2019s intellectual property by others without authorization may reduce any competitive advantage UNIFI has developed, cause it to lose sales or otherwise harm its business.\nUNIFI has investments in less than 100% owned affiliates that it does not control, which subjects UNIFI to uncertainties about the operating performance and quality of financial reporting of these affiliates.\nThe most significant of these investments is UNIFI\u2019s 34% minority interest in PAL. While this investment is designed to provide industry diversity for UNIFI, UNIFI does not have majority voting control of PAL or the ability otherwise to control PAL\u2019s policies, management or affairs. The interests of persons who control PAL may differ from UNIFI\u2019s, and those persons may cause PAL to take actions that are not in UNIFI\u2019s best interest. Among other things, UNIFI\u2019s inability to control PAL may adversely affect its ability to receive distributions from PAL or to fully implement its business plan. The incurrence of debt or entry into other agreements by PAL may result in restrictions or prohibitions on PAL\u2019s ability to make distributions to UNIFI. Even where PAL is not restricted by contract or by law from making distributions, UNIFI may not be able to influence the timing or amount of such distributions. In addition, if the controlling investor in PAL fails to observe its commitments, PAL may not be able to operate according to its business plan, or UNIFI may need to increase its level of investment commitment. If any of these events were to occur, UNIFI\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nUNIFI also relies on accurate financial reporting from PAL for preparation of UNIFI\u2019s quarterly and annual consolidated financial statements. Errors in the financial information reported by PAL could be material to UNIFI and may require us to restate past financial statements. Any such restatements could have a material adverse effect on UNIFI or the market price of our common stock.\nPAL receives economic adjustment payments from the Commodity Credit Corporation under the Economic Adjustment Assistance to Users of Upland Cotton. The economic assistance received under this program must be used to acquire, construct, install, modernize, develop, convert or expand land, plant, buildings, equipment or machinery directly attributable to the purpose of manufacturing upland cotton into eligible cotton products in the United States. Should PAL no longer meet the criteria to receive economic assistance under the program, or should the program be discontinued, PAL\u2019s business and profitability could be significantly impacted, which would adversely affect UNIFI.\nUNIFI requires cash to service its indebtedness and fund capital expenditures and strategic initiatives, and its ability to generate sufficient cash for those purposes depends on many factors beyond its control.\nUNIFI\u2019s principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and borrowings under its credit facility. UNIFI\u2019s ability to make payments on its indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures and strategic initiatives will depend on its ability to generate future cash flows from operations. This ability, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond UNIFI\u2019s control. The business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, and future borrowings may not be available to UNIFI in amounts sufficient, to enable UNIFI to pay its indebtedness and to fund its other liquidity needs. Any such development would have a material adverse effect on UNIFI.\nA decline in general economic or political conditions, and changes in consumer spending, could cause a decline in demand for textile products, including UNIFI\u2019s products.\nUNIFI\u2019s products are used in the production of fabric primarily for the apparel, hosiery, home furnishings, automotive, industrial and other end-use markets. Demand for furniture and other durable goods is often affected significantly by economic conditions that have global or regional industry-wide consequences. Demand for a number of categories of apparel also tends to be tied to economic cycles and customer preferences that affect the textile industry in general. Demand for textile products, therefore, tends to vary with the business cycles of the United States and other economies, as well as changes in global trade flows, and economic and political conditions. Additionally, prolonged economic downturns that negatively impact UNIFI\u2019s results of operations and cash flows could result in future material impairment charges to write-down the carrying value of certain assets, including amortizable intangible assets and equity affiliates.\nChanges in consumer spending, customer preferences, fashion trends and end-uses for UNIFI\u2019s products could weaken UNIFI\u2019s competitive position and cause UNIFI\u2019s products to become less competitive, and its sales and profits may decrease as a result. Additionally, the end-consumer retail and apparel markets may continue to experience difficult conditions characterized by reduced retail traffic and growth in online sales channels, which may cause bankruptcies, store closures and other transformations for traditional retail enterprises, which could have an adverse effect on UNIFI\u2019s business and financial condition.\nHistoric trends indicate weakening performance in the nylon sector on a global basis. If the decline is significant in any one year, the impact could have a material adverse effect on UNIFI\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nUnfavorable changes in trade policies and/or violations of existing trade policies could weaken UNIFI\u2019s competitive position significantly and have a material adverse effect on its business.\nA number of markets within the textile industry in which UNIFI sells its products, particularly the apparel, hosiery and home furnishings markets, are subject to intense foreign competition. Other markets within the textile industry in which UNIFI sells its products may in the future become subject to more intense foreign competition. There are currently a number of trade regulations and duties in place to protect the U.S. textile industry against competition from low-priced foreign producers, such as those in China and Vietnam. Changes in such trade regulations or duties may make the price of UNIFI\u2019s products less attractive than the goods of its competitors or the finished products of a competitor in the supply chain, which could have a material adverse effect on UNIFI\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nAccording to industry experts and trade associations, there has been a significant amount of illegal transshipments of apparel products into the United States and into certain other countries in the NAFTA and CAFTA-DR regions in which UNIFI competes. Illegal transshipment involves circumventing duties by falsely claiming that textiles and apparel are products of a particular country of origin (or include yarn of a particular country of origin) to avoid paying higher duties or to receive benefits from regional free trade agreements, such as NAFTA and CAFTA-DR. If illegal transshipments are not monitored, and if enforcement is not effective to limit them, these shipments could have a material adverse effect on UNIFI\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn January 2017, the United States withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, an evolving trade agreement that included Vietnam, a major textile and apparel exporting country whose duty-free benefits under the agreement could have had an adverse effect on UNIFI\u2019s business in the long term. In May 2017, the Trump administration formally notified Congress of its intent to renegotiate NAFTA. The United States has a positive trade balance in the textile and apparel sector in NAFTA and UNIFI anticipates any modifications to the agreement in this sector will not significantly impact textile and apparel trade in the region.", "PERMNO": 78044, "SIC": 2200, "TIC": "UFI"}
