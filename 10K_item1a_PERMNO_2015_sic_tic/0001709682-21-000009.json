{"cik": "1709682", "company": "NESCO HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAny of the risk factors described in this Annual Report could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations.\nInvestors should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports as well as our other SEC filings. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also have adverse impact to our business operations. Should any of these risks materialize, our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted, which could in turn affect the trading value of our securities.\nRisk Factor Summary\nFor a summary of risk factors, see our \u201cDisclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factor Summary.\u201d\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic or Another Pandemic\nThe financial condition and results of operations of our business may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or other pandemics.\nHealth concerns arising from the outbreak of a health epidemic or pandemic, including COVID-19, may have an adverse effect on our business. Our business could be materially and adversely affected by the outbreak of a widespread health epidemic or pandemic, including arising from various strains of coronavirus, such as COVID-19, or avian flu, or swine flu, such as H1N1, particularly if located in regions where inputs for our supply chain are manufactured. COVID-19 has spread to a significant number of countries and has had a global economic impact on the financial markets and economies of many countries. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that the United States and Canada impose widespread quarantines that may limit our ability to offer our products and services to our customers. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, states in which we operate imposed restrictions on travel and other measures designed to control the spread of COVID-19. Although we were deemed an essential business during the pandemic, our first priority remains the health and safety of our employees and their families. Employees whose tasks can be done offsite have been instructed to work from home. Our service locations remain operational, and we are maintaining social distancing and enhanced cleaning protocols and usage of personal protective equipment, where appropriate. Nesco was negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during second quarter of 2020 and continuing into the third quarter of 2020, particularly during July and August; however, we began to see a normal seasonal uptick take hold starting in late August and continuing to the end of the year. While Nesco has not yet reached the same levels as a year ago, and remains cautious about the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the pandemic could lead to an extended disruption of economic activity and the impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be material. Furthermore, another significant outbreak of COVID-19 or another contagious diseases in the human population could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect our operating results. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nDemand for our products and services is cyclical and vulnerable to industry downturns and regional and national downturns, which may result from the current economic conditions.\nThe demand for specialty equipment in the electric utility T&D, telecommunications, rail and private non-residential construction industries has been, and will likely continue to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns specific to the industry, as well as to the United States economy in general. If the general level of economic activity were to decrease below historic norms, or the time frames for updating the electricity, telecommunications, and rail infrastructure, or compliance periods for government-regulated reliability levels were extended, financing conditions for our industry could be adversely affected and our customers may delay commencement of work on, or cancel, new projects or maintenance activity on existing projects. A number of other factors, including changes in government infrastructure spending programs, outside of our control could adversely affect electric utility T&D, telecommunications and rail project spending, which could result in lower demand from our customers for our products and services. As a result, demand for our products and services could decline for extended periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, each of electric utility T&D, telecommunication, rail and private non-residential construction industries may be affected at different times from market fluctuations specific to those industries.\nA worsening of economic conditions, in particular with respect to industrial activities, could cause weakness in our end markets and adversely affect our revenues and operating results.\nOur revenue and operating results have historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate, which could result in a decline in our profitability and make it more difficult for us to grow our business.\nOur revenue and operating results have historically varied from quarter to quarter. Periods of decline could result in an overall decline in profitability and make it more difficult for us grow our business. We expect our quarterly results to continue to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022general economic conditions in the markets where we operate;\n\u2022the cyclical nature of the industries in which our customers operate (electric utility T&D, telecommunications, rail and non-residential construction);\n\u2022severe weather and seismic conditions temporarily affecting the regions where we operate;\n\u2022changes in governmental regulations specific to the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022changes in government spending for infrastructure projects;\n\u2022the effectiveness of integrating acquired businesses and new start-up businesses;\n\u2022the cost and availability of capital to make acquisitions;\n\u2022the cost and availability of equipment to replenish and grow our rental fleet;\n\u2022changes in demand for, or utilization of, our equipment or in the prices we charge due to changes in economic conditions, competition or other factors;\n\u2022increases in interest rates and related increases in our interest expense and our debt service obligations;\n\u2022currency risks and other risks associated with international operations;\n\u2022an overcapacity of fleet in the equipment rental industry;\n\u2022changes in the size of our rental fleet and/or in the rate at which we sell our used equipment; and\n\u2022the impact of changes in tax regulation on the economic benefits of leasing equipment compared to buying equipment.\nWe are subject to competition, which may have a material adverse effect on our business by reducing our ability to increase or maintain revenues or profitability.\nThe specialty equipment rental industry, especially as it relates to rental companies, is highly competitive and highly fragmented. Many of the markets in which we operate are served by numerous competitors, ranging from national and regional equipment rental companies to small, independent businesses with a limited number of locations. We generally compete on the basis of availability, quality, reliability, delivery, price and customer services. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do, and may be able to reduce rental rates or sales prices. In addition, we cannot be certain that our existing or prospective customers will continue to rent equipment in the future.\nThe cost of new equipment that we purchase for use in our rental fleet or for our sales inventory may increase and therefore we may spend more for such equipment, and in some cases, we may not be able to procure equipment on a timely basis due to supplier constraints.\nThe cost of new equipment from manufacturers that we purchase for use in our rental fleet may increase as a result of factors beyond our control, such as inflation, higher interest rates and increased raw material costs, including increases in the cost of steel, which is a primary material used in most of the equipment we use. Such increases could materially impact our financial condition or results of operations in future periods if we are not able to pass such cost increases through to our customers in the form of higher prices. In addition, based on changing demands of our customers, the types of equipment we rent to our customers may become obsolete resulting in a negative impact to our financial condition based on the increased capital expenditures required to replace the obsolete equipment, and our potential inability to sell the obsolete equipment in the used equipment market. In addition, we may incur losses upon dispositions of our rental fleet due to residual value risk.\nIf the average age of our fleet of rental equipment were to increase, the cost of maintaining our equipment, if not replaced within a certain period of time, will likely increase. The costs of maintenance may materially increase in the future. Any significant increase in such costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, the market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold. The market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors, including:\n\u2022the market price for new equipment of a like kind;\n\u2022wear and tear on the equipment relative to its age;\n\u2022the time of year that it is sold (prices are generally higher during the construction seasons);\n\u2022worldwide and domestic demands for used equipment;\n\u2022the supply of used equipment on the market; and\n\u2022general economic conditions.\nWe include in operating income the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of equipment sold. Changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense, as well as the gains or losses realized upon disposal of equipment. We cannot assure that used equipment selling prices will not decline. Any significant decline in the selling prices for used equipment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be unsuccessful at acquiring companies or at integrating companies that we acquire and, as a result, may not achieve expected benefits, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOne of our growth strategies is to selectively pursue, on an opportunistic basis, acquisitions of additional companies that will allow us to continue to expand our service offering and geographic footprint. We expect to face competition for acquisition candidates, which may limit the number of acquisition opportunities and may lead to higher acquisition prices. We may not be able to identify, acquire or profitably manage additional businesses or integrate successfully any acquired businesses without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial problems. Further, acquisitions involve certain risks, including failure of the acquired business to achieve expected results, diversion of management\u2019s attention, failure to retain key personnel of the acquired business and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities, some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to obtain the necessary acquisition financing or we may have to increase our indebtedness in order to finance an acquisition. Furthermore, general economic conditions or unfavorable global capital and credit markets could affect the timing and extent to which we implement our strategy and limit our ability to successfully acquire new businesses. Our future business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer if we fail to successfully implement our acquisition strategy.\nWe might not be able to recruit and retain the experienced personnel we need to compete in our industries.\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled personnel. Competition for personnel in our industry is intense and we must have talented personnel to succeed. Our ability to meet our performance goals depends upon the personal efforts and abilities of the principal members of our senior management, who provide strategic direction, develop the business, manage our operations, and maintain a cohesive and stable work environment. We cannot provide assurance that we will retain or successfully recruit senior executives, or that their services will remain available to us. We will evaluate our senior management capabilities on an ongoing basis in consideration of, among other things, our business strategy, changes to our capital structure, developments in our industry and markets and our ongoing financial performance and consider, where appropriate, supplementing, changing or otherwise enhancing our senior management team and operational and financial management capabilities in order to maximize our performance. Accordingly, our organizational structure and senior management team may change in the future. Changes to our senior management team could result in a material business interruption resulting from the loss of their services.\nOur work force could become unionized in the future, which could negatively impact the stability of our production, materially reduce our profitability and increase the risk of work stoppages.\nWe currently operate with no collective bargaining agreements with our workforce. Our employees have the right at any time under the National Labor Relations Act to form or affiliate with a union, and unions may conduct organizing activities in this regard. If our employees choose to form or affiliate with a union and the terms of a union collective bargaining agreement are significantly different\nfrom our current compensation and job assignment arrangements with our employees, these arrangements could negatively impact the stability of our production, materially reduce our profitability and increase the risk of work stoppages. In addition, even if our managed operations remain non-union, our business may still be adversely affected by work stoppages at any of our suppliers that are unionized.\nDisruptions in our information technology systems or a compromise of security with respect to our systems could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations, adjust to changing market conditions, implement strategic initiatives.\nOur information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions. Any disruption of these systems or the failure of any of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions. In addition, because our systems may contain information about individuals and businesses, our failure to maintain the security of the data we hold, whether the result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others, could harm our reputation or give rise to legal liabilities leading to lower revenues, increased costs and other potential material adverse effects on our results of operations.\nWe may experience threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks. We have implemented a multi-layered approach to protect our data and systems from software attacks and conduct annual security awareness training sessions for all Nesco employees. Additionally, we support web filters in place that prevent users from accessing suspect sites and deploy endpoint protection on user computers in addition to multiple mail filters that are in place to help manage spam and phishing attempts. We rely on our security software layer vendors to stay current with threats, and if any of these breaches of security occur or there are new threats that are not covered by our current software, we could be required to expend additional capital and other resources, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees and engage third-party experts and consultants. In addition, because our systems sometimes contain information about individuals and businesses, our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold, whether as a result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others, could lead to unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information or corruption of data. Our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold could also violate applicable privacy, data security and other laws and subject us to lawsuits, fines and other means of regulatory enforcement. Complying with any new regulatory requirements could force us to incur substantial expenses or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could harm our business. Further, any compromise or breach of our systems could result in adverse publicity, harm our reputation, lead to claims against us and affect our relationships with our customers and employees, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Certain of our software applications are also utilized by third parties who provide outsourced administrative functions, which may increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident. Although we maintain insurance coverage for various cybersecurity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.\nWe have observed a global increase in information technology security threats and more sophisticated cyber-attacks. Our business could be impacted by such disruptions, which in turn could pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, accessibility and integrity of information stored and transmitted on those systems and networks. We have adopted measures to address cyber-attacks and mitigate potential risks to our systems from these information technology-related disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature and scope of such disruptions, our systems and networks remain potentially vulnerable to attacks. Depending on their nature and scope, such attacks could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information, misuse of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, misappropriation of assets or production stoppages and supply shortages, which in turn could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations, adjust to changing market conditions, implement strategic initiatives.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional capital as required, we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business.\nIf the cash that we generate from our business, together with cash that we may borrow under any debt facilities we have or may enter into in the future is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements, we will require additional debt and/or equity financing. However, we may not succeed in obtaining the requisite additional financing or such financing may include terms that are not satisfactory to us. We may not be able to obtain additional debt financing as a result of prevailing interest rates or other factors, including the presence of covenants or other restrictions under the agreements governing our current and future debt, including debt facilities entered into in connection with the Debt Financing. In the event we seek to obtain equity financing, our stockholders may experience dilution as a result of the issuance of additional equity securities. This dilution may be significant depending upon the number of equity securities that we issue and the prices at which we issue such securities. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future, we\nmay be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business, including those relating to purchasing equipment, growth plans and refinancing existing indebtedness.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we are unable to renew our leases upon their expiration.\nWe lease from third parties a substantial majority of the square footage of the facilities utilized in our operations, including with respect to certain of our sales, service, warehousing and office locations. If we are unable to renew the existing leases on terms acceptable to us, we may be forced to relocate the affected operations. Alternatively, we may decide to relocate operations. Relocation could result in material disruptions to our business (including potential changes to our workforce if the new location does not allow for our existing workforce to service it) and our incurrence of significant capital and other expenses, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.\nFailure to keep pace with technological developments may adversely affect our operations.\nWe are engaged in an industry that will be affected by future technological developments. The introduction of products or processes utilizing new technologies could render our existing products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. Our success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce new products, applications and processes that keep pace with technological developments and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements in a timely and cost-effective basis. We may not be successful in identifying, developing and marketing new products, applications and processes and product or process enhancements. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of new products, applications, processes or enhancements. Our products, applications or processes may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. Our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected if we were to incur delays in developing new products, applications, processes or enhancements, or if our products do not gain market acceptance.\nUnfavorable conditions or disruptions in the capital and credit markets may adversely impact industry conditions and the availability of credit to our customers and suppliers, which may have a material adverse effect on our organic growth strategies, financial condition or results of operations.\nDisruptions in the global capital and credit markets as a result of economic downturns, economic uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability to access capital. Additionally, unfavorable market conditions could impede the rate of economic recovery, which may depress demand for our products and services or make it more difficult for our customers to obtain financing and credit on reasonable terms. Also, more of our customers may be unable to meet their payment obligations to us, increasing delinquencies and credit losses. Moreover, our suppliers may be adversely impacted, causing disruption or delay of product availability.\nIn addition, if the financial institutions that commit to lend us money under any debt facilities we have entered into or may enter into in the future are adversely affected by the conditions of the capital and credit markets, they may become unable to fund borrowings under those commitments, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and our ability to borrow funds, if needed, for working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes. These events could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe purchase a significant amount of our equipment from a limited number of manufacturers and suppliers. An adverse change in or termination of our relationships with any of those manufacturers or suppliers could result in our inability to obtain equipment on an adequate or timely basis, negatively impacting our relationships with our customers and having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe purchase most of our equipment from a limited group of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). We rely on these suppliers and manufacturers to provide us with equipment that we will either rent or sell to customers. To the extent we are unable to rely on these suppliers and manufacturers, due to an adverse change in our relationships with them, if they fail to continue operating as a going concern, if they significantly raise their costs, if a large amount of our rental equipment is subject to simultaneous recalls that would prevent us from obtaining such equipment for a significant period of time, or such suppliers or manufacturers simply are unable to supply us with equipment or needed replacement parts in a timely manner, our business could be adversely affected through higher costs or the resulting potential inability to provide products or services to our customers. We may experience delays in receiving equipment from some manufacturers due to factors beyond our control, including parts and material shortages, and, to the extent that we experience any such delays, our customer relationships could be damaged by the resulting inability to meet our customers\u2019 needs. In addition, the payment terms we have negotiated with the suppliers that provide us with the majority of our equipment may not be available to us at a later time. Although we believe that we have alternative sources of supply for the rental equipment we purchase in\neach of our core product categories, termination of one or more of our relationships with any of these major suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have, and in the future may have, operations outside the United States which are subject to changes in political or economic conditions and regulations in that country. Additionally, we may incur losses from currency conversions and have higher costs than it otherwise would have due to the need to comply with foreign laws.\nOur operations in Canada and former operations in Mexico, as well as any future international operations, are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations. These include the need to convert currencies, which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates and the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations, as well as U.S. laws and regulations applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions. The effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted and may adversely impact us and our operations.\nNesco has had operations in Mexico. Nesco began commencing activities for the closure of its Mexican operations in 2019, although the closure is not yet complete. As a result, Nesco is subject to risks of doing business internationally, including changes in the economic strength of Mexico, difficulties in enforcing contractual obligations and intellectual property rights, burdens of complying with a wide variety of international and U.S. laws, economic sanctions and social, political and economic instability. Nesco must also comply with applicable anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials. Nesco cannot guarantee compliance with all applicable laws, and violations could result in substantial fines, sanctions, civil or criminal penalties, competitive or reputational harm, litigation or regulatory action and other consequences that might adversely affect our results of operations and our consolidated performance. Factors that substantially affect the operations of our business in Mexico may have a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations.\nThe risks with respect to Mexico or other developing countries include, but are not limited to: nationalization of properties, military repression, extreme fluctuations in currency exchange rates, criminal activity, lack of personal safety or ability to safeguard property, labor instability or militancy and high rates of inflation. We may be affected in varying degrees by government regulation with respect to price controls, export controls, income taxes, expropriation of property, maintenance of claims, environmental legislation and opposition from non-governmental organizations. The effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted and may adversely impact our operations.\nIn recent years, incidents of security disruptions throughout many regions of Mexico have increased. Drug-related gang activity has grown in Mexico. Certain incidents of violence have occurred in regions in which we operate and have resulted in the interruption of our operations, and these interruptions could increase in the future.\nOur business relies to some extent on third-party contractors to provide us with various services to assist us with conducting our business, which could adversely affect our business upon the termination or disruption of our third-party contractor relationships.\nOur operations rely on third-party contractors to provide us with timely services to assist us with conducting our business. Any material disruption, termination, or substandard provision of these services could adversely affect our brand, customer relationships, operating results and financial condition. In addition, if a third-party contractor relationship is terminated, we may be adversely affected if we are unable to enter into a similar agreement with alternate providers in a timely manner or on terms that we consider favorable. Further, in the event a third-party relationship is terminated and we are unable to enter into a similar relationship, we may not have the internal capabilities to perform such services in a cost-effective manner.\nWe may need to recognize impairment charges related to goodwill, identified intangible assets and fixed assets, which would negatively impact our operating results.\nWe have substantial balances of goodwill and identified intangible assets as a result of prior acquisitions. Any future acquisitions and/or mergers are estimated to result in additional goodwill and intangible assets. We are required to test goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite life for possible impairment on the same date each year and on an interim basis if there are indicators of a possible impairment. We are also required to evaluate amortizable intangible assets and fixed assets for impairment if there are indicators of a possible impairment.\nThere is significant judgment required in the analysis of a potential impairment of goodwill, identified intangible assets and fixed assets. If, as a result of a general economic slowdown, deterioration in one or more of the markets in which we operate or in our financial performance and/or future outlook, the estimated fair value of our long-lived assets decreases. We may determine that one or more of our long-lived assets is impaired. An impairment charge would be determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets and any such impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to collect on contracts with customers, our operating results would be adversely affected.\nOne of the reasons some of our customers choose to rent equipment rather than own equipment is the need to deploy their capital elsewhere. Some of our customers may have liquidity issues and ultimately may not be able to fulfill the terms of their rental agreements with us. If we are unable to manage credit risk issues adequately, or if a large number of customers should have financial difficulties at the same time, our credit losses could increase above historical levels and our operating results would be adversely affected. Further, delinquencies and credit losses generally can be expected to increase during economic slowdowns or recessions.\nWe are exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims that could adversely affect our operating results. The nature of our business exposes us to various liability claims, which may exceed the level of our insurance coverage and thereby not fully protect us.\nWe are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business. Litigation in general can be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. Responding to lawsuits brought against us, or legal actions that we may initiate, can often be expensive and time-consuming. Unfavorable outcomes from these claims and/or lawsuits could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, and we could incur substantial monetary liability and/or be required to change our business practices.\nOur business exposes us to claims for personal injury, death or property damage resulting from the use of the equipment we rent or sell and from injuries caused in motor vehicle accidents in which our delivery and service personnel are involved and other employee related matters. Additionally, we could be subject to potential litigation associated with compliance with various laws and governmental regulations at the federal, state or local levels, such as those relating to the protection of persons with disabilities, employment, health, safety, security and other regulations under which we operate.\nWe carry comprehensive insurance, subject to deductibles, at levels we believe are sufficient to cover existing and future claims made during the respective policy periods. However, we may be exposed to multiple claims that do not exceed our deductibles and, as a result, we could incur significant out-of-pocket costs that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the cost of such insurance policies may increase significantly upon renewal of those policies as a result of general rate increases for the type of insurance we carry, as well as our historical experience and experience in our industry. Our existing or future claims may exceed the coverage level of our insurance, and such insurance may not continue to be available on economically reasonable terms. If we are required to pay significantly higher premiums for insurance, are not able to maintain insurance coverage at affordable rates, or if we must pay amounts in excess of claims covered by our insurance, or if we are exposed to multiple claims that do not exceed our deductibles, we could experience higher costs that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory developments that we believe should encourage electric power transmission infrastructure spending may fail to result in increased demand for our equipment.\nIn recent years, federal and state legislation has been passed and resulting regulations have been adopted that could significantly increase spending on electric power transmission infrastructure, including the Energy Act of 2005 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the \u201cARRA\u201d). However, much fiscal, regulatory and other uncertainty remains as to the impact this legislation and related regulations will ultimately have on the demand for our rental equipment and, as such, the effect of these regulations is uncertain and may not result in increased spending on the electric power transmission infrastructure. Continued uncertainty regarding the implementation of the Energy Act of 2005 and ARRA may result in slower growth in demand for our rental equipment.\nRenewable energy initiatives, including ARRA, may not lead to increased demand for our equipment. In addition, we cannot predict when programs under ARRA will be implemented or the timing and scope of any investments to be made under these programs, particularly in light of capital constraints on potential developers of these projects. In addition, some of these programs have expired, which may affect the economic feasibility of future projects. Investments for renewable energy and electric power infrastructure under ARRA may not occur, may be less than anticipated or may be delayed, or any resulting contracts may not be awarded to us, any of which could negatively impact demand for our equipment.\nTo service our indebtedness, we require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. An inability to service our indebtedness could lead to a default under the indenture that governs\nthe senior secured notes or the credit agreement that governs our asset-based revolving credit facility, which may result in an acceleration of our indebtedness.\nTo service our indebtedness, we require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to pay interest and principal in the future on our indebtedness and to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend upon our future operating performance and the availability of refinancing indebtedness, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, the availability of capital, as well as financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nOur future cash flow may not be sufficient to meet our obligations and commitments. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our indebtedness and to meet our other commitments, we will be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness, selling material assets or operations or seeking to raise additional debt or equity capital. These actions may not be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or at all, and these actions may not enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements. In addition, our debt agreements, including the indenture that governs the senior secured notes and the credit agreement that governs our asset-based revolving credit facility, may contain restrictive covenants prohibiting us from adopting any of these alternatives. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness.\nThe indenture and the credit agreement that governs our asset-based revolving credit facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on our company and our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities.\nThe indenture that governs the senior secured notes and the credit agreement that governs our asset-based revolving credit facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit our ability, among other things, to:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022pay dividends or certain other distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022make certain investments or other restricted payments;\n\u2022place restrictions on the ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to us;\n\u2022engage in transactions with stockholders or affiliates;\n\u2022sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies, reorganize our companies, or suspend or go out of a substantial portion of our business;\n\u2022prepay or modify the terms of our other indebtedness;\n\u2022guarantee indebtedness; and\n\u2022create liens.\nThese restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make strategic acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand economic downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise. A failure to comply with the restrictions in the indenture that governs the senior secured notes and the credit agreement that governs our asset-based revolving credit facility could result in an event of default under such instruments or credit agreement. Our future operating results may not be sufficient to enable compliance with the covenants in such indenture or credit agreement or to remedy any such default. In addition, in the event of an acceleration, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to refinance our indebtedness or make any accelerated payments, including those under the notes and under our asset-based revolving credit facility. Also, we may not be able to obtain new financing. Even if we were able to obtain new financing, we cannot guarantee that the new financing will be on commercially reasonable terms or terms that are acceptable to us. If we default on our indebtedness, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we fail to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants. We anticipate that substantially similar restrictions will be imposed pursuant to the documentation governing the indebtedness incurred in connection with the Debt Financing.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nChanges to international trade agreements, tariffs, import and excise duties, taxes or other governmental rules and regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe U.S. federal government or other governmental bodies may propose changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, taxes and other government rules and regulations. Any changes to the international trading system, or the emergence or escalation of an international trade dispute, could significantly impact our business and have a negative impact on our revenues. In addition, the U.S. and other countries from which materials used heavily in the industries that we serve may impose import and excise duties, tariffs and other taxes on products in varying amounts. Any significant increases in import and excise duties or other taxes on products that ultimately impact and are used in the industries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and/or results of operations.\nIn the United States and globally, international trade policy is undergoing review and revision, introducing significant uncertainty with respect to future trade regulations and existing international trade agreements. These major revisions include the negotiation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\u201cUSMCA\u201d) (in Canada, known as the Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (\u201cCUSMA\u201d)), which is intended to supersede the North American Free Trade Agreement (\u201cNAFTA\u201d). USMCA/CUSMA has been signed but not ratified by the legislature of each of the United States, Canada and Mexico. NAFTA provides protection against tariffs, duties and other charges or fees and assures access by the signatories. The impact of USMCA/CUSMA, if ratified, on the industries in which we operate is uncertain but could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to, and could be adversely affected by, safety and environmental requirements, which could force us to increase significant capital and other operational costs and may subject us to unanticipated liabilities.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state and local occupational health and safety and environmental laws and regulations. We are subject to potential civil or criminal fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements. We have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures in order to comply with these laws and regulations. However, the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and could become more stringent in the future. It is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including, among others, expenditures for the investigation and cleanup of contamination at or emanating from currently and formerly owned and leased properties, as well as contamination at other locations at which our wastes have reportedly been identified. Some of these laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances joint and several liability on current and former owners or operators of contaminated sites and other potentially responsible parties for investigation, remediation and other costs.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations and the costs of complying with them, or any liability or obligation imposed under them, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations with respect to the ownership and operation of tanks for the storage of petroleum products, such as gasoline, diesel fuel and motor and waste oils. We can provide no assurance that our tanks will remain free from leaks at all times or that the use of these tanks will not result in significant spills or leakage. If leakage or a spill occurs, it is possible that the resulting costs of cleanup, investigation and remediation, as well as any resulting fines, could be significant. We can provide no assurance that compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations will not require material expenditures by us or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.\nThe U.S. Congress and other federal and state legislative and regulatory authorities in the U.S. and internationally have considered, and will likely continue to consider, numerous measures related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. Should rules establishing limitations on greenhouse gas emissions or rules imposing fees on entities deemed to be responsible for greenhouse gas emissions become effective, demand for our services could be affected, our vehicle, and/or other, costs could increase, and our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have operations, and rent equipment, throughout the United States, which exposes us to multiple state and local regulations, in addition to federal law and requirements as a government contractor. Changes in applicable law, tax regimes, regulations or requirements, or our material failure to comply with any of them, can increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business.\nWe are geographically diverse and operate in multiple leased facilities and maintain access to a number of third-party service locations geographically dispersed across the U.S. and Canada, which exposes us to a host of different state and local regulations, in addition to\nfederal law and regulatory requirements. These laws and requirements address multiple aspects of our operations, such as state and local taxes, worker safety, consumer rights, privacy, employee benefits and more, and there are often different requirements in different jurisdictions. Changes in these requirements, or any material failure by us or our branches to comply with them, can increase our costs, affect our reputation, limit our business, occupy management time and attention and otherwise impact our operations in adverse ways.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nReports published by analysts, including projections in those reports that differ from our actual results, could adversely affect the price and trading volume of common stock.\nWe currently expect that securities research analysts will establish and publish their own periodic projections for our business. However, there is no assurance that they will in fact publish reports on our company. Any projections included in research analyst reports may vary widely and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our stock price may decline if our actual results do not match the projections of these securities research analysts. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who write reports on us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, our stock price or trading volume could decline. We can provide no assurance that any research analysts will cover our securities and if no analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price and volume for our common stock could be adversely affected.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common shares and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to declare and pay dividends on our common shares for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth and potentially reduce our indebtedness. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common shares for the foreseeable future and the success of an investment in our common shares will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that our common shares will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which our shareholders have purchased their shares. The payment of future dividends, however, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our board of directors deems relevant. The credit agreement that governs our asset-based revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our existing senior secured notes (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) also effectively limit our ability to pay dividends. As a consequence of these limitations and restrictions, we may not be able to make, or may have to reduce or eliminate, the payment of dividends on our common shares.\nWe are currently an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act. As an emerging growth company, our securities may be less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies. To the extent we have taken advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, including use of the extended the transition period for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act. We anticipate losing our emerging growth company status in 2021 should the transactions described in this annual report, be consummated.\nWe are currently an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different\napplication dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time non-public companies adopt the new or revised standard. For a description of applicable new or revised financial accounting standards, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Polices, to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company, which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period, difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used.\nAs a result of the pending acquisition of Custom Truck and the related transactions, we currently anticipate that we will lose our \u201cemerging growth company\u201d status. A company continues to be an emerging growth company until one of the following occurs: (i) annual revenue exceeds $1.07 billion; (ii) non-convertible debt of more than $1.0 billion is issued in the past three years; or, (iii) the company becomes a large accelerated filer, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2. As a result of losing such status, we will no longer be able to take advantage of certain exemptions from reporting, and we will also be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We will incur additional expenses in connection with such compliance and our management will need to devote additional time and effort to implement and comply with such requirements.\nThe requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, increases costs and distracts management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company, we are subject to laws, regulations and requirements, certain corporate governance provisions, related regulations of the SEC and the requirements of the NYSE. We rely on a small number of key personnel to manage compliance with these regulations, and compliance with such regulations causes additional costs to our operations and diverts management\u2019s attention from implementing our growth strategy, which could prevent us from improving our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal control over financial reporting, accounting systems disclosure controls and procedures, auditing functions and other procedures related to public reporting in order to meet our reporting obligations as a public company.\nNesco may identify material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which may result in material misstatements of their financial statements or cause a failure to meet their reporting obligations.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for Nesco to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. If we identify any material weaknesses that may exist, the accuracy and timing of its financial reporting may be adversely affected. Additionally, we may be unable to maintain compliance with securities law requirements regarding timely filing of periodic reports as well as applicable stock exchange listing requirements. We may be unable to prevent fraud, investors may lose confidence in its financial reporting, and the stock price may also decline. Nesco\u2019s reporting obligations as a public company could place a significant strain on its management, operational and financial resources and systems for the foreseeable future and may cause it to fail to timely achieve and maintain the adequacy of its internal control over financial reporting.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. As a result, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. Nesco can provide no assurance that the measures they are currently undertaking or may take in the future will be sufficient to maintain effective internal controls or to avoid potential future deficiencies in internal control, including material weaknesses.\nNeither management of Nesco, nor an independent accounting firm has ever performed an evaluation of Nesco\u2019s internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act because no such evaluation has been required. Had Nesco or its independent accounting firm performed an evaluation of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, material weaknesses may have been identified. Nesco\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to and report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting until after it is no longer an emerging growth company, which we expect will occur in 2021 as a result of the pending transactions described in this annual report. At that time, the independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which internal controls over financial reporting are documented, designed, or operating. Failing to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results and could cause a decline in the price of their securities.\nWe are controlled by affiliates of ECP, whose interests in our business may be different than yours.\nAs of December 31, 2020, ECP owned more than 50% of our common stock and is able to control our affairs in all cases. Pursuant to the Stockholders\u2019 Agreement, four of the members of our board of directors have been designated by ECP. So long as ECP continues to own a majority of our common shares, they will have the ability to control the vote in any election of directors and will have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires shareholder approval regardless of whether other shareholders believe the transaction is in our best interests. Additionally, pursuant to our principal stockholders agreement, ECP will continue to have the ability to designate four of our directors until it owns less than 45% of the outstanding common shares. In any of these matters, the interests of ECP or other controlling shareholders may differ from or conflict with the interests of holders of our common stock or other securities. Moreover, this concentration of share ownership may also adversely affect the trading price for our common shares to the extent investors perceive disadvantages in owning shares of a company with a controlling shareholder. In addition, our Sponsors are in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with our business, as well as businesses that are our significant existing or potential suppliers or customers. Our significant shareholders may acquire or seek to acquire assets that we seek to acquire and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us or may be more expensive for us to pursue.\nWe may redeem unexpired Warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to the holders of our Warrants, thereby making such Warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants (other than the certain private Warrants issued to affiliates) at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at $0.01 per Warrant, if the last reported sales price (or the closing bid price of our shares of common stock in the event the shares of common stock are not traded on any specific trading day) of the shares of common stock equals or exceeds $18 per share for each of 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period ending on the third business day prior to the date we send proper notice of such redemption, provided that on the date we give notice of redemption and during the entire period thereafter until the time we redeem the warrants, we have an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available. If and when the Warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding Warrants could force a warrant holder: (i) to exercise Warrants and pay the exercise price therefore at a time when it may be disadvantageous for holders of our Warrants to do so, (ii) to sell Warrants at the then-current market price when holders might otherwise wish to hold their Warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, will be substantially less than the market value of such Warrants.\nWe may issue additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities without shareholder approval, which would dilute shareholder ownership interests and may depress the market price of our common stock.\nECP has the right to receive: (1) up to an additional 1,800,000 shares of common stock for a period of five years following the closing of the Transactions (the \u201cClosing\u201d), in increments of 900,000 shares, if (x) the trading price of the common stock exceeds $13.00 per share or $16.00 per share for any 20 trading days during a 30 consecutive trading day period or (y) a sale transaction of Nesco occurs in which the consideration paid per share to holders of common stock of Nesco exceeds $13.00 per share or $16.00 per share, and (2) an additional 1,651,798 shares of common stock if during the seven-year period following the Closing, the trading price of common stock exceeds $19.00 per share for any 20 trading days during a 30 consecutive trading day period or if a sale transaction of Nesco occurs in which the consideration paid per share to holders of common stock exceeds $19.00 per share.\nOur issuance of additional shares of common stock or other equity securities of equal or senior rank would have the following effects:\n\u2022our existing shareholders\u2019 proportionate ownership interest will decrease;\n\u2022the amount of cash available per share, including for payment of dividends in the future, may decrease;\n\u2022the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding common share may be diminished; and\n\u2022the market price of our shares of common stock may decline.\nRisks Related to the Pending Acquisition\nAny delay in completing the Acquisition may reduce or eliminate the benefits expected to be achieved thereunder.\nIn addition to the required regulatory clearances, the Acquisition is subject to a number of other conditions beyond the control of the parties to the transaction that may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect its completion. We cannot predict whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied. Furthermore, the requirements for obtaining the required clearances and approvals could delay the completion of the Acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in completing the Acquisition could cause the combined company not to realize, or to be delayed in realizing, some or all of the synergies that we expect to achieve if the Acquisition is successfully completed within its expected time frame.\nUncertainties associated with the Acquisition may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company.\nNesco and Custom Truck are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their respective officers and other key employees to execute their business plans. The combined company\u2019s success after the Acquisition will depend in part upon the ability of Nesco and Custom Truck to retain key management and other key employees. Current and prospective employees of Nesco and Custom Truck may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company following the Acquisition, which may have an adverse effect on the ability of each of Nesco and Custom Truck to attract or retain key management and other key employees. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to attract or retain key management and other key employees of Nesco and Custom Truck to the same extent that Nesco and Custom Truck have previously been able to attract or retain their own employees. A failure by Nesco, Custom Truck or, following the completion of the Acquisition, the combined company to attract, retain and motivate key management and other key employees during the period prior to or after the completion of the Acquisition could have a negative impact on their respective businesses.\nFailure to complete the Acquisition could negatively impact the stock price and the future business and financial results of Nesco.\nCompletion of the Acquisition is not assured and is subject to risks, including the risks that approval of the Acquisition by governmental entities will not be obtained or that certain other closing conditions will not be satisfied. If the Acquisition is not completed, the ongoing businesses and financial results of Nesco may be adversely affected and Nesco will be subject to several risks, including the following:\n\u2022having to pay certain significant costs relating to the Acquisition without receiving the benefits of the Acquisition, including, in certain circumstances, a termination fee of $10 million;\n\u2022having to pay certain significant costs relating to the issuance of common stock in connection with the Acquisition without receiving the benefits of such issuance, including, in certain circumstances, a termination fee of $15.25 million;\n\u2022the potential loss of key personnel during the pendency of the Acquisition as employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company;\n\u2022Nesco will have been subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business which may have prevented them from making certain acquisitions or dispositions or pursuing certain business opportunities while the Acquisition was pending; and\n\u2022having had the focus management on the Acquisition instead of on pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to Nesco.\nIf the Acquisition is not completed, Nesco cannot provide assurance that these risks will not materialize and will not materially adversely affect the business, financial results and stock prices of Nesco.\nThe Investment Agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing transaction involving Nesco.\nThe Investment Agreement contains a \u201cno shop\u201d provision that, subject to limited exceptions, restricts Nesco\u2019s ability to solicit, initiate or encourage and induce, or take any other action designed to facilitate competing third-party proposals relating to a merger, reorganization or consolidation of the Company or an acquisition of a significant portion of the Company\u2019s stock or assets. In addition, Platinum generally has an opportunity to offer to modify the terms of the issuance of common stock related to the Acquisition in response to any competing acquisition proposals before the Board may withdraw or qualify its recommendation with respect to the Acquisition.\nThese provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of Nesco from considering or proposing that acquisition, including as a result of the added expense of the termination fees that may become payable in certain circumstances.\nNesco\u2019s executive officers and directors have certain interests in the Acquisition that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Nesco stockholders generally.\nNesco\u2019s executive officers and directors have certain interests in the Acquisition that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of Nesco stockholders generally. Nesco\u2019s executive officers negotiated the terms of the Purchase Agreement and the Investment Agreement. The executive officers of Nesco have arrangements with Nesco that provide for severance benefits if their employment is terminated under certain circumstances following the completion of the Acquisition. There will be accelerated vesting of equity awards held by some or all of our non-employee directors who will not continue as directors of the combined company after the Acquisition. Nesco may act before completion of the Acquisition to amend certain terms of equity awards held by employees and to enter into certain compensatory arrangements related to the Acquisition. Executive officers and directors also have rights to indemnification and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance that will survive completion of the Acquisition.\nAt the closing of the Acquisition, the board of directors will be reconstituted to include up to eleven directors, with up to seven directors designated by Platinum, one director designated by each of ECP, Capitol and Blackstone and the chief executive officer of Nesco.\nThe Nesco board of directors was aware of these interests at the time it approved the Acquisition. These interests, including the continued employment of certain executive officers of Nesco by the combined company, the continued positions of certain directors of Nesco as directors of the combined company and the indemnification of former directors and officers by the combined company, may cause Nesco\u2019s directors and executive officers to view the Acquisition proposal differently and more favorably than you may view it.\nSubsequent to the completion of our Acquisition, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nAlthough we have conducted due diligence in connection with the Acquisition, we can provide no assurance that this diligence will surface all material issues that may arise as a result of the consummation of the Acquisition. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write down or write off assets, restructure operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about the post-combination company or its securities.\nNesco will incur significant transaction and transition costs in connection with the Acquisition.\nNesco expects to incur significant, non-recurring costs in connection with consummating the Acquisition. Nesco may also incur additional costs to retain key employees. In general, all expenses incurred in connection with the Acquisition, including all legal, accounting, consulting, investment banking and other fees, expenses and costs, will be paid by the party incurring such expense.\nIntegration of the Nesco and Custom Truck businesses may be difficult, costly and time-consuming, and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Acquisition may not be realized or may be less than expected.\nEven if the Acquisition is completed, our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate the two businesses. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate Nesco and Custom Truck or, if the integration is successfully accomplished, that the integration will not be more costly or take longer than presently contemplated. If we cannot successfully integrate and manage the two businesses within a reasonable time following the Acquisition, we may not be able to realize the potential and anticipated benefits of the Acquisition, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur ability to realize the expected synergies and benefits of the Acquisition is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. These risks and uncertainties could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results, and include, among other things:\n\u2022our ability to complete the timely integration of operations and systems, organizations, standards, controls, procedures, policies and technologies, as well as the harmonization of differences in the business cultures of Nesco and Custom Truck;\n\u2022our ability to minimize the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns during the integration process;\n\u2022our ability to retain the service of key management and other key personnel;\n\u2022our ability to preserve customer, supplier and other important relationships and resolve potential conflicts that may arise;\n\u2022the risk that certain customers and suppliers will opt to discontinue business with the combined business or exercise their right to terminate their agreements as a result of the Acquisition pursuant to change of control provisions in their agreements or otherwise;\n\u2022the risk that Custom Truck may have liabilities that we failed to or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence;\n\u2022difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the combination; and\n\u2022difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex combined business.\nWe may encounter additional integration-related costs, fail to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the Acquisition or be subject to other factors that adversely affect preliminary estimates. In addition, even if the operations of the two businesses are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the Acquisition may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that we expect. The occurrence of any of these events, individually or in combination, could have a material adverse effect on the combined business\u2019 financial condition and operating results.\nOur public stockholders will experience dilution as a consequence of the Acquisition. Having a minority share position may reduce the influence that our current stockholders have on the management of the post-combination company.\nThe issuance of common stock in connection with the Acquisition will dilute the equity interest of our existing stockholders and may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our public shares and/or public warrants.\nIt is anticipated that, upon completion of the Acquisition, the Company\u2019s public stockholders (other than the Platinum, ECP, Capitol and Blackstone but including purchasers in the Supplemental Equity Offering) will retain an ownership interest of approximately 22% in the post-combination company. Additionally, following the completion of the Acquisition, and subject to the approval of the applicable award agreements by the post-Acquisition board of directors, Nesco may alter or supplement existing equity compensation plans. In connection with the Issuance, it is expected that (a) pursuant to the Investment Agreement (i) between 140,000,000 and 152,600,000 shares of common stock, at a purchase price of $5.00 per share will be issued, and (ii) up to an additional 20,000,000 shares of common stock, at a purchase price of $5.00 per share, will be issued in the event the backstop to the Supplemental Equity Financing is utilized, in each case, to Platinum; (b) pursuant to the Investment Agreement, purchase shares of common stock in (i) a private placement, (ii) a registered public offering and/or (iii) a rights offering to its stockholders, in each case, for the aggregate amount of up to $200.0 million (for the avoidance of doubt, including the Supplemental Equity Financing); and (c) pursuant to the rollover of certain equity interests of Blackstone and certain members of the management of Custom Truck whereby the sellers will receive an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares of common stock, at a purchase price of $5.00 per share.\nResales of the shares issued pursuant to the issuance of securities undertaken in connection with the Acquisition could depress the market price of Nesco\u2019s common stock.\nThe shares issued pursuant to the transactions will be subject to registration rights. Following the effectiveness of the registration statement that we have agreed to file pursuant to such registration rights such shares will be freely tradable. We also expect that such shares will be subject to potential resale pursuant to Rule 144. Resales of such shares following the expiration of any applicable lock-up agreement could depress the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 17032, "SIC": 5063, "TIC": "NSCO"}
