{"cik": "1083643", "company": "FAUQUIER BANKSHARES, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s securities involves risks and uncertainties. In addition to the other information contained in this report, including the information addressed under \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d investors in the Company\u2019s securities should carefully consider the factors discussed below. These factors could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and capital position and could cause the Company\u2019s actual results to differ materially from its historical results or the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report, in which case the trading price of the Company\u2019s securities could decline.\nRisk Factors Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic.\nThe economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. On March 12, 2020, the former President of the United States declared the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States a national emergency. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant economic dislocation in the United States as many state and local governments ordered non-essential businesses to close and residents to shelter in place at home. This has resulted in an unprecedented slow-down in economic activity and a related increase in unemployment. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the Federal Reserve has reduced the benchmark federal funds rate to a target range of 0% to 0.25%, and the yields on 10 and 30-year treasury notes have declined to historic lows. Various state governments and federal agencies are encouraging, or in some cases requiring, lenders to provide forbearance and other relief to borrowers (e.g., waiving late payment and other fees). The federal banking agencies have encouraged financial institutions to prudently work with affected borrowers through the issuance of an interagency statement, and federal legislation has provided relief from reporting loan classifications due to modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain industries have been particularly hard-hit, including the travel and hospitality industry, the restaurant industry and the retail industry. Finally, the spread of COVID-19 has caused the Company to modify business practices, including branch operations, employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences. The Company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, clients and business partners.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the Company or its business. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including when the coronavirus can be controlled and abated and when and how the economy may be reopened.\nAs the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and national economic consequences, the Company could be subject to any of the following risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations:\n\u2022\ndemand for products and services may decline, making it difficult to grow assets and income;\n\u2022\nif the economy is unable to substantially reopen, and high levels of unemployment continue for an extended period of time, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charges, additions to the allowance for loan losses, and reduced income, among other impacts;\n\u2022\ncollateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could cause loan losses to increase;\n\u2022\nthe allowance for loan losses may have to be increased if borrowers experience financial difficulties beyond forbearance periods, which will adversely affect net income;\n\u2022\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments;\n\u2022\nas the result of the decline in the Federal Reserve\u2019s target federal funds rate, the yield on the Company\u2019s assets may decline to a greater extent than the decline in its cost of interest-bearing liabilities, reducing its net interest margin and spread and reducing net income;\n\u2022\na material decrease in net income or a net loss over several quarters could result in a decrease in the rate of the Company\u2019s quarterly cash dividend;\n\u2022\nthe Company\u2019s wealth management and trust revenues may decline with continuing market turmoil;\n\u2022\nthe Company relies on third party vendors for certain services and the unavailability of a critical service due to the COVID-19 outbreak could have an adverse effect the Company and its operations; and\n\u2022\nFDIC premiums may increase if the agency experiences additional resolution costs.\nMoreover, the Company\u2019s future success and profitability substantially depends on the management skills of our executive officers. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees due to the outbreak could harm our ability to operate the Company\u2019s business or\nexecute its business strategy. The Company may not be successful in finding and integrating suitable successors in the event of key employee loss or unavailability.\nAny one or a combination of the factors identified above could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects.\nAs a participating lender in the PPP, the Company and the Bank are subject to additional risks of litigation from the Bank\u2019s clients or other parties regarding the Bank\u2019s processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties.\nOn March 27, 2020, the former President of the United States signed the CARES Act, which included a $349 billion loan program administered through the SBA referred to as the PPP. Under the PPP, small businesses and other entities and individuals can apply for loans from existing SBA lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enroll in the program, subject to numerous limitations and eligibility criteria. The Bank is participating as a lender in the PPP. There continues to be some ambiguity in the laws, regulations and administrative guidance related to the PPP. In addition, since the opening of the PPP, several large banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the PPP. The Company and the Bank may be exposed to the risk of similar litigation, from both clients and non-clients that approached the Bank regarding PPP loans, regarding its process and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. If any such litigation is filed against the Company or the Bank and is not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company or the Bank, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation. In addition, litigation can be costly, regardless of outcome. Any financial liability, litigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank also has credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Bank, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Bank, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the Company or the Bank.\nRisk Factors Related to the Merger Agreement with Virginia National\nCombining Virginia National and the Company may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected.\nThe success of the Merger will depend, in part, on Virginia National\u2019s ability after the Merger to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses of Virginia National and the Company and to combine the businesses of Virginia National and the Company in a manner that permits growth opportunities and cost savings to be realized without materially disrupting the existing customer relationships of the Company or decreasing revenues due to loss of customers. If Virginia National is not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\nVirginia National and the Company have operated, and, until the completion of the Merger, will continue to operate, independently. To realize these anticipated benefits of the Merger, after the completion of the Merger, Virginia National expects to integrate the Company\u2019s business into its own. The integration process in the Merger could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each party\u2019s ongoing business, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that affect adversely either party\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger. The loss of key employees could adversely affect Virginia National\u2019s ability to successfully conduct its business in the markets in which the Company now operates, which could have an adverse effect on Virginia National\u2019s financial results and the value of its common stock. If Virginia National experiences difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. As with any merger of financial institutions, there also may be disruptions that cause Virginia National and the Company to lose customers or cause customers to withdraw their deposits from the Company\u2019s or Virginia National\u2019s banking subsidiaries, or other unintended consequences that could have a material adverse effect on Virginia National\u2019s results of operations or financial condition after the Merger. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on the Company during this transition period and on Virginia National for an undetermined period after consummation of the Merger.\nBecause the market price of Virginia National common stock will fluctuate, the value of the consideration to be received by the Company\u2019s shareholders in the Merger may change.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, each share of the Company\u2019s common stock, except for certain shares of the Company\u2019s common stock owned by the Company or Virginia National, that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger\nwill be converted into the right to receive 0.6750 shares of common stock of Virginia National. The closing price of Virginia National common stock on the date that the Merger is completed may vary from the closing price of Virginia National common stock on the date the Company and Virginia National announced the signing of the Merger Agreement. Because the Merger consideration is determined by a fixed exchange ratio, at the time of the Company\u2019s special meeting, the Company\u2019s shareholders will not know or be able to calculate the value of the shares of Virginia National common stock they will receive upon completion of the Merger. Any change in the market price of Virginia National common stock prior to completion of the Merger may affect the value of the Merger consideration that the Company\u2019s shareholders will receive upon completion of the Merger. Stock price changes may result from a variety of factors, including general market and economic conditions, changes in the companies\u2019 respective businesses, operations and prospects, and regulatory considerations, among other things. Many of these factors are beyond the control of the Company and Virginia National. The Company\u2019s shareholders should obtain current market quotations for shares of Virginia National common stock and the Company\u2019s common stock before voting their shares at the Company\u2019s special meeting of shareholders.\nThe Merger may distract management of the Company from its other responsibilities.\nThe Merger could cause the management of the Company to focus its time and energies on matters related to the Merger that otherwise would be directed to its business and operations. Any such distraction on the part of the Company\u2019s management, if significant, could affect its ability to service existing business and develop new business and may adversely affect the business and earnings of the Company before the Merger, or the business and earnings of Virginia National after the Merger.\nTermination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact the Company.\nEach of the Company\u2019s and Virginia National\u2019s obligation to consummate the Merger remains subject to a number of conditions, and there can be no assurance that all of the conditions will be satisfied, or that the Merger will be completed on the proposed terms, within the expected timeframe, or at all. Any delay in completing the Merger could cause the Company not to realize some or all of the benefits that the Company expects to achieve if the Merger is successfully completed within its expected timeframe. If the Merger Agreement is terminated, the Company\u2019s business may be impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Merger. Additionally, if the Merger Agreement is terminated, the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be completed. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, including circumstances involving a change in recommendation by the Company's board of directors, the Company may be required to pay to Virginia National a termination fee of $2.5 million.\nIn addition, the Company has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. If the Merger is not completed, the Company would have to recognize these expenses and would have committed substantial time and resources by management, without realizing the expected benefits of the Merger. In addition, failure to consummate the Merger also may result in negative reactions from the financial markets or from the Company\u2019s customers, vendors and employees. If the Merger is not completed, these risks may materialize and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s stock price, business and cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Merger Agreement limits the ability of the Company to pursue alternatives to the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement contains \u201cno-shop\u201d provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, limits the ability of the Company to discuss, facilitate or commit to competing third-party proposals to acquire all or a significant part of the Company. In addition, under certain circumstances, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and the Company, subject to certain restrictions, consummates a similar transaction other than the Merger, the Company must pay to Virginia National a fee of $2.5 million. These provisions might discourage a potential competing acquiror that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of the Company from considering or proposing the acquisition even if it were prepared to pay consideration, with respect to the Company, with a higher per share market price than that proposed in the Merger.\nThe Company will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on the Company. These uncertainties may impair the Company\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with the Company to seek to change existing business relationships with the Company. Retention of certain employees by the Company may be challenging while the Merger is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the Company or the combined company following the Merger. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the Company or the combined company following the Merger, the Company\u2019s business, or the business of the combined company following the Merger, could be harmed. In addition, the Company has agreed to operate its business in the ordinary course prior to the closing of the Merger and from taking certain specified actions until the\nMerger occurs, and the Merger Agreement restricts the Company from taking other specified actions until the merger occurs without the consent of Virginia National. These restrictions may prevent the Company from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger.\nRisk Factors Related to the Company\u2019s Lending Activities\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to various lending and other economic risks that could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business is directly affected by general economic and market conditions; broad trends in industry and finance; legislative and regulatory changes; changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies; and inflation, all of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. A deterioration in economic conditions, in particular a prolonged economic slowdown within the Company\u2019s geographic region, could result in the following consequences which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business: an increase in loan delinquencies; an increase in problem assets and foreclosures; a decline in demand for products and services; and a deterioration in the value of collateral for loans.\nThe Company\u2019s focus on lending to small to mid-sized community-based businesses may increase its credit risk.\nMost of the Company\u2019s commercial business and commercial real estate loans are made to small business or middle market customers. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and have a heightened vulnerability to economic conditions. Additionally, these loans may increase concentration risk as to industry or collateral securing the loans. If general economic conditions in the market areas in which the Company operates negatively impact this important customer sector, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Moreover, a portion of these loans have been made by the Company in recent years and the borrowers may not have experienced a complete business or economic cycle. The deterioration of the borrowers\u2019 businesses may hinder their ability to repay their loans with the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s credit standards and on-going credit assessment processes might not protect it from significant credit losses.\nThe Company takes credit risk by virtue of making loans and extending loan commitments and letters of credit. Credit risk is managed through a program of underwriting standards, the review of certain credit decisions and an ongoing process of assessment of the quality of the credit already extended. In addition, the Company\u2019s credit administration function employs risk management techniques intended to promptly identify problem loans. While these procedures are designed to provide the Company with the information needed to implement policy adjustments where necessary and to take appropriate corrective actions, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in avoiding future undue credit risk, and credit losses may occur in the future.\nIf the Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses becomes inadequate, its financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nMaking loans is an essential element of the Company\u2019s business. The risk of nonpayment is affected by a number of factors, including but not limited to: the duration of the credit; credit risks of a particular customer; changes in economic and industry conditions; and, in the case of a collateralized loan, risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of the collateral. Although the Company seeks to mitigate risks inherent in lending by adhering to specific underwriting practices, loans may not be repaid. The Company attempts to maintain an appropriate allowance for loan losses to provide for losses in the loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is determined by analyzing numerous factors about the loan portfolio including historical loan losses for relevant periods of time, current trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, current economic conditions that may affect a borrower\u2019s ability to repay and the value of collateral, changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio and industry information. Also included are qualitative considerations with respect to the effect of potential economic events, the outcomes of which are uncertain.\nBecause any estimate of loan losses is subjective and the accuracy depends on the outcome of future events, charge-offs in future periods may exceed the allowance for loan losses and additional increases in the allowance for loan losses may be required. Additions to the allowance for loan losses would result in a decrease of profitability. Although management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio, the Company cannot predict such losses or that the allowance will be adequate in the future.\nIn addition, the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) No. 2016-13, as amended, could result in an increase in the allowance for loan losses as a result of changing from an \u201cincurred loss\u201d model, which encompasses allowances for current known and inherent losses within the portfolio, to an \u201cexpected loss\u201d model, which encompasses allowances for losses expected to be incurred over the life of the portfolio. As a smaller reporting company, the Company has elected to defer adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 until January 1, 2023.\nFor information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their effect on the Company, see \u201cRecent Accounting Pronouncements and Other Regulatory Statements\u201d in Note 1 \u201cNature of Banking Activities and Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d contained in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly capital, and may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nNonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nNonperforming assets adversely affect net income in various ways. The Company does not record interest income on nonaccruing loans, which adversely affects income and increases credit administration costs. When the Company receives collateral through foreclosures and similar proceedings, it is required to mark the related loan to the then fair market value of the collateral less estimated selling costs, which may result in a loss. An increased level of nonperforming assets also increases the Company\u2019s risk profile and may impact the capital levels regulators believe are appropriate in light of such risks. The Company utilizes various techniques such as workouts, restructurings and loan sales to manage problem assets. Increases in, or negative adjustments in, the value of these problem assets, the underlying collateral, or in the borrowers\u2019 performance or financial condition, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time from management and staff, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities, including generation of new loans. There can be no assurance that the Company will avoid increases in nonperforming assets in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s real estate lending business can result in increased costs associated with other real estate owned (\u201cOREO\u201d).\nBecause the Company originates loans secured by real estate, the Company may have to foreclose on the collateral property and may thereafter own and operate such property. The amount that may be realized after a default is dependent upon factors outside of the Company\u2019s control, including, but not limited to, general or local economic conditions, environmental cleanup liability, neighborhood values, interest rates, real estate tax rates, operating expenses of the mortgaged properties, and supply of and demand for properties. Certain expenditures associated with the ownership of income-producing real estate, principally real estate taxes and maintenance costs, may adversely affect the net cash flows generated by the real estate. Therefore, the cost of operating income-producing real property may exceed the rental income earned, if any, from such property, and the Company may have to advance funds in order to protect its investment or may be required to dispose of the real property at a loss.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business, Industry and Markets\nAdverse changes in economic conditions in the Company\u2019s market areas or adverse conditions in industries on which such markets are dependent could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company provides full service banking and other financial services in Fauquier and Prince William counties in Virginia. The Company\u2019s loan and deposit activities are directly affected by economic conditions within these markets, as well as conditions in the industries on which those markets are economically dependent. A deterioration in local economic conditions or in the condition of an industry on which a local market depends could adversely affect such factors as unemployment rates, business formations and expansions, and housing market conditions. Adverse developments in any of these factors could result in, among other things, a decline in loan demand, a reduction in the number of creditworthy borrowers seeking loans, an increase in delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures, an increase in classified and nonaccrual loans, a decrease in the value of loan collateral, and a decline in the financial condition of borrowers and guarantors, any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetition from other financial institutions and financial intermediaries may adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe Company faces competition in originating loans and in attracting deposits principally from other banks, mortgage banking companies, consumer finance companies, savings associations, credit unions, brokerage firms, insurance companies, fintech companies and other institutional lenders and purchasers of loans. Advancements in technology and other changes have lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. In particular, the activity of fintech companies has grown significantly over recent years and is expected to continue to grow. Fintech companies have and may continue to offer bank or bank-like products and some fintech companies have applied for bank charters. Other fintech companies have partnered with existing banks to allow them to offer deposit products to their customers. Additionally, banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve the credit needs of larger clients. These institutions may be able to offer the same loan products and services that the Company offers at more competitive rates and prices. Increased competition could require the Company to increase the rates paid on deposits or lower the rates offered on loans, which could adversely affect profitability.\nWeakness in the secondary residential mortgage loan markets will adversely affect noninterest income.\nOne of the components of the Company\u2019s strategic plan is to generate noninterest income from loans originated for sale into the secondary market. Interest rates, low housing inventory, cash buyers, new mortgage lending regulations and other market conditions could have an adverse effect on loan originations across the industry which would reduce our noninterest income.\nThe Company relies on deposits obtained from customers in the Company\u2019s market area to provide liquidity and to support growth.\nThe Company\u2019s business strategies are based on access to funding from local customer deposits. Deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors, including interest rates paid by competitors, general interest rate levels, returns available to customers on alternative investments and general economic conditions. If deposit levels fall, the Company could lose a relatively low-cost source of funding and interest expense would likely increase as alternative funding to replace lost deposits may be necessary. If local customer deposits are not sufficient to fund the Company\u2019s normal operations and growth, the Company will look to outside sources, such as borrowings from the FHLB, which is a secured funding source. The Company\u2019s ability to access borrowings from the FHLB will be dependent upon whether and the extent to which collateral to secure FHLB borrowings can be provided. The Company may also look to federal funds purchased and brokered deposits. The Company may also seek to raise funds through the issuance of shares of its common stock, or other equity or equity-related securities, or debt securities including subordinated notes as additional sources of liquidity. If the Company is unable to access funding sufficient to support business operations and growth strategies or is only able to access such funding on unattractive terms, the Company may not be able to implement its business strategies which may negatively affect financial performance.\nRisk Factors Related to the Company\u2019s Operations and Technology\nThe Company relies on dividends from the Bank for substantially all of its revenue.\nThe Company is a bank holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through the Bank. As a result, the Company relies on dividends from the Bank for substantially all of its revenues. There are various regulatory restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends or make other payments to the Company, and the Company\u2019s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon the Bank\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the Bank\u2019s creditors. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, the Company may not be able to service its outstanding borrowings and other debt, pay its other obligations or pay a cash dividend to the holders of the Company\u2019s common stock, and the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Further, although the Company has historically paid cash dividends to holders of its common stock, these holders are not entitled to receive dividends and regulatory or economic factors may cause the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to consider, among other actions, the reduction of dividends paid on the Company\u2019s common stock even if the Bank continues to pay dividends to the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s risk management framework may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.\nThe Company maintains an enterprise risk management program that is designed to identify, quantify, monitor, report and control the risks it faces including, but not limited to, interest rate, credit, liquidity, operational, reputation, legal, compliance, economic and litigation risk. Although the risk management program is assessed on an ongoing basis, the Company gives no assurance that the risk management framework and related controls will effectively mitigate the risks listed above or limit losses that may occur. If the Company\u2019s risk management program or controls do not function effectively, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s operations may be adversely affected by cybersecurity risks.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of its customers and employees in systems and on networks. The secure processing, maintenance, and use of this information is critical to operations and the Company\u2019s business strategy. The Company has invested in accepted technologies, and continually reviews processes and practices that are designed to protect its networks, computers, and data from damage or unauthorized access. Despite these security measures, the Company\u2019s computer systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. A breach of any kind could compromise systems and the information stored there could be accessed, damaged or disclosed. A breach in security could result in legal claims, regulatory penalties, disruption in operations, and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, which could adversely affect its business and financial condition. Furthermore, as cyber threats continue to evolve and increase, the Company may be required to expend significant additional financial and operational resources to modify or enhance its protective measures, or to investigate and remediate any identified information security vulnerabilities.\nIn addition, multiple major U.S. retailers have experienced data systems incursions reportedly resulting in the thefts of credit and debit card information, online account information and other financial or privileged data. Retailer incursions affect cards issued and deposit\naccounts maintained by many banks, including the Bank. Although the Company\u2019s systems are not breached in retailer incursions, these events can cause it to reissue a significant number of cards and take other costly steps to avoid significant theft loss to the Company and its customers. In some cases, the Company may be required to reimburse customers for the losses they incur. Other possible points of intrusion or disruption not within the Company\u2019s control include internet service providers, electronic mail portal providers, social media portals, distant-server (cloud) service providers, electronic data security providers, telecommunications companies, and smart phone manufacturers. Additionally, in recent years banking regulators have focused on the responsibilities of financial institutions to supervise vendors and other third-party service providers. The Company may have to dedicate significant resources to manage risks and regulatory burdens, including the Company\u2019s data processing and cybersecurity service providers.\nFurthermore, because some of our employees are working remotely from their homes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an increased risk of disruption to our operations because they are utilizing residential networks and infrastructure which may not be as secure as in our office environment.\nBusiness counterparties, over which the Company may have limited or no control, may experience disruptions that could adversely affect the Company.\nMultiple major U.S. retailers and a major consumer credit reporting agency have experienced data systems incursions in recent years reportedly resulting in the thefts of credit and debit card information, online account information, and other personal and financial data of hundreds of millions of individuals. Retailer incursions may affect debit cards issued and deposit accounts maintained by many banks. Although the Company is not aware of any instance in which the Bank\u2019s systems have been breached in a retailer incursion, these events can cause the Bank to reissue a significant number of cards and take other costly steps to avoid significant theft loss to the Bank and its customers. In some cases, the Bank may be required to reimburse customers for losses they incur. Credit reporting agency intrusions affect the Bank\u2019s customers and can require these customers and the Bank to increase monitoring and take remedial action to prevent unauthorized account activity or access. Other possible points of intrusion or disruption outside the Company\u2019s control include internet service providers, electronic mail portal providers, social media portals, distant-server (or \u201ccloud\u201d) service providers, electronic data security providers, telecommunications companies and smart phone manufacturers.\nThe Company is technology dependent and an inability to invest in technological improvements may adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services, which may require substantial capital expenditures to modify or adapt existing products and services. In addition to enhancing customer service, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and results in reduced costs, although a financial institution\u2019s initial investment in a technology product or service may represent a significant incremental cost. The Company\u2019s future success will depend, in part, upon the ability to create synergies in operations through the use of technology and to facilitate the ability of customers to engage in financial transactions in a manner that enhances the customer experience. The Company cannot assure that technological improvements will increase operational efficiency or that the Company will be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to customers, which may cause the Company to lose market share or incur additional expense.\nFailure to maintain effective systems of internal and disclosure control could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nEffective internal and disclosure controls are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company. As part of the Company\u2019s ongoing monitoring of internal control, it may discover material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in its internal control that require remediation. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Any failure to maintain effective controls or to timely effect any necessary improvement of the Company\u2019s internal and disclosure controls could, among other things, result in losses from fraud or error, harm the Company\u2019s reputation or cause investors to lose confidence in the Company\u2019s reported financial information, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company relies heavily on its management team and the unexpected loss of key officers may adversely affect operations.\nThe Company believes that growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills and experience of its executive officers and on their relationships with the communities it serves. The loss of the services of one or more of these officers could disrupt operations and impair the Company\u2019s ability to implement its business strategy, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s business strategies depends on its ability to identify and recruit individuals with experience and relationships in its primary markets.\nThe successful implementation of the Company\u2019s business strategy will require the Company to continue to attract, hire, motivate and retain skilled personnel to develop new customer relationships as well as new financial products and services. The market for qualified management personnel is competitive. In addition, the process of identifying and recruiting individuals with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out the Company\u2019s strategy is often lengthy, and the Company may not be able to effectively integrate these individuals into its operations. The Company\u2019s inability to identify, recruit and retain talented personnel to manage its operations effectively and in a timely manner could limit growth, which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s corporate culture has contributed to its success, and if the Company cannot maintain this culture, the Company could lose the beneficial aspects fostered by this culture, which could harm business.\nThe Company believes that a critical contributor to its success has been its corporate culture, which focuses on building personal relationships with its customers. As the Company grows, and more complex organizational management structures are required, the Company may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of this corporate culture, which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s future success.\nRisks Related to Market Interest Rates\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk and fluctuations in interest rates may negatively affect its financial performance.\nThe Company\u2019s profitability depends, in part, on its net interest margin, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets, and interest paid on deposits and borrowings divided by total interest-earning assets. Changes in interest rates will affect the Company\u2019s net interest margin in diverse ways, including the pricing of loans and deposits, the levels of prepayments and asset quality. The Company is unable to predict actual fluctuations of market interest rates because many factors influencing interest rates are beyond the Company\u2019s control. Management believes that the Company\u2019s current interest rate exposure is manageable and does not indicate any significant exposure to interest rate changes. The Company expects continued pressure on its net interest margin due to continued low market rates and intense competition for loans and deposits from both local and national financial institutions. Continued pressure on net interest margin could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank may be required to transition from the use of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) index in the future.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR. On November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, the administrator of the LIBOR, announced that it would consult on its plan to cease the publication of one-week and two-month LIBOR immediately after December 31, 2021 and to cease the publications of the remaining tenors of LIBOR (one, three, six, and 12-month) immediately after June 30, 2023. The Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC also issued a statement encouraging banks to transition away from LIBOR as soon as practicable. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. As a result, the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. At this time, it is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR. Similarly, it is impossible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what effects any such changes in views or alternatives may have on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments.\nRegulators, industry groups, and others have, among other things, published recommended replacement language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, identified recommended alternatives for certain LIBOR rates (e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate), and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments. There is not yet any consensus on what recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted.\nThe Company has loans and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR could create additional costs and additional risk. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition could change the Company\u2019s market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with customers could adversely impact the Company\u2019s reputation. Although the Company is currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, failure to adequately manage the transition could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Regulation of the Company\nCompliance with laws, regulations and supervisory guidance, both new and existing, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to numerous laws, regulations and supervision from both federal and state agencies. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in financial, structural and operational penalties, including receivership. In addition, establishing systems and processes to achieve compliance with these laws and regulations may increase costs and/or place limits on pursuing certain business opportunities.\nThe legislative and regulatory environment is beyond the Company\u2019s control, may change rapidly and unpredictably and may negatively influence profitability and capital levels. The Company\u2019s success depends on its ability to maintain compliance with both existing and new laws and regulations.\nFuture legislation, regulation and government policy could affect the banking industry as a whole, including the Company\u2019s results of operations, in ways that are difficult to predict. In addition, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the way in which existing statutes and regulations are interpreted or applied by courts and government agencies.\nThe CFPB may increase the Company\u2019s regulatory compliance burden and could affect consumer financial products and services that the Company offers.\nThe CFPB is reshaping the consumer financial laws through rulemaking and enforcement of the Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s prohibitions against unfair, deceptive and abusive consumer finance products or practices, which are directly affecting the business operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services. This agency\u2019s broad rulemaking authority includes identifying practices or acts that are unfair, deceptive or abusive in connection with any consumer financial transaction, financial product or service. Although the CFPB has jurisdiction over banks with $10 billion or greater in assets, rules, regulations and policies issued by the CFPB may also apply to the Company by virtue of the adoption of such policies and best practices by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. Further, the CFPB may include its own examiners in regulatory examinations by the Company\u2019s primary regulators. The total costs and limitations related to this additional regulatory agency and the limitations and restrictions that will be placed upon the Company with respect to consumer products and services have yet to be determined in their entirety. However, these costs, limitations and restrictions are producing, and may continue to produce, significant, material effects on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory capital standards, including the Basel III Capital Rules, require the Company and the Bank to maintain higher levels of capital and liquid assets, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s profitability and return on equity.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules and related changes to the standardized calculations of risk-weighted assets are complex and created additional compliance burdens, especially for community banks. The Basel III Capital Rules require bank holding companies and their subsidiaries to maintain significantly more capital as a result of higher required capital levels and more demanding regulatory capital risk weightings and calculations. While the Company is exempt from these capital requirements under the SBHC Policy Statement, the Bank is not exempt and must comply. The Bank must also comply with the capital requirements set forth in the \u201cprompt corrective action\u201d regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Satisfying capital requirements may require the Company or the Bank to limit its banking operations, retain net income or reduce dividends to improve regulatory capital levels, which could negatively affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. The EGRRCPA amended the Dodd-Frank Act to, among other things, provide relief from certain of these requirements. The Company does not expect the EGRRCPA and the related rulemakings to materially reduce the impact of capital requirements on its business.\nThe Company\u2019s earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies.\nThe policies of the Federal Reserve affect the Company significantly. The Federal Reserve regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies directly and indirectly influence the rate of interest earned on loans and paid on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of financial instruments. Those policies determine, to a significant extent, the cost of funds for lending and investing. Changes in those policies are beyond the Company\u2019s control and are difficult to predict. Federal Reserve policies can also affect the Company\u2019s borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. This could adversely affect the borrower\u2019s earnings and ability to repay a loan, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s deposit insurance premiums could increase in the future, which may adversely affect future financial performance.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC insured financial institutions, including the Bank. The FDIC charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the DIF at a certain level. Economic conditions that began with the financial crisis of 2008 increased the rate of bank failures through 2014, requiring the FDIC to make payments for insured deposits from the DIF and prepare for future payments from the DIF. A depository institution\u2019s deposit insurance assessment is calculated based on the institution\u2019s total assets less tangible equity, rather than the previous base of total deposits. The Bank\u2019s FDIC insurance premiums could increase in future periods if the Bank\u2019s asset size increases, if the FDIC raises base assessment rates, or if the FDIC takes other actions to replenish the DIF.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nChanges in accounting standards and management\u2019s selection of accounting methods, including assumptions and estimates, could materially affect the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nFrom time to time, the SEC and Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company\u2019s financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially affect how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in changes to previously reported financial results, or a cumulative charge to retained earnings. In addition, management is required to use certain assumptions and estimates in preparing financial statements, including determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, among other items. If the assumptions or estimates are incorrect, the Company may experience unexpected material consequences.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock price may be volatile, which could result in losses to investors.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock price has been volatile in the past, and several factors could cause the price to fluctuate in the future. These factors include, but are not limited to, actual or anticipated variations in earnings, changes in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections, operations and stock performance of other peer companies, and reports of trends and concerns and other issues related to the financial services industry. Fluctuations in the Company\u2019s common stock price may be unrelated to performance. General market declines or market volatility in the future, especially in the financial institutions sector, could adversely affect the price of the Company\u2019s common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices.\nFuture sales of the Company\u2019s common stock by shareholders or the perception that those sales could occur may cause the Company\u2019s common stock price to decline.\nAlthough the Company\u2019s common stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market, the trading volume may be lower than that of other larger financial institutions. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of the common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which the Company has no control. Given the potential for lower relative trading volume, significant sales of the common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales may occur, could cause the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock to decline or to be lower than it otherwise might be in the absence of these sales or perceptions.\nFuture issuances of the Company\u2019s common stock could adversely affect the market price and could be dilutive.\nThe Company may issue additional shares of common stock or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. Issuances of a substantial number of shares of common stock, or the expectation that such issuances might occur, could adversely affect the market price of the shares of common stock and could be dilutive to shareholders. Any decision the Company makes to issue common stock in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors, and the Company cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of possible future issuances. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s shareholders bear the risk that future issuances could reduce the market price of the common stock and dilute their stock holdings in the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s dividends may not be sustained.\nAlthough the Company has historically paid cash dividends to holders of its common stock, holders of common stock are not entitled to receive dividends. Financial, regulatory or economic factors may cause the Company\u2019s Board of Directors to consider, among other actions, the suspension or reduction of dividends paid on the Company\u2019s common stock. Furthermore, the Company is a bank holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through its subsidiaries, including the Bank. As a result, the Company relies on dividends from the Bank for substantially all of its revenues. There are various regulatory restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay\ndividends or make other payments to the Company. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, the Company may not be able to pay a cash dividend to the holders of the Company\u2019s common stock.", "PERMNO": 87488, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FBSS"}
