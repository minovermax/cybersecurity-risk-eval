{"cik": "31107", "company": "EASTERN CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-17", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Form 10-K and the Company\u2019s other filings with the SEC, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks or additional risks not presently known to the Company, or by risks the Company currently deems immaterial, which may also adversely affect its business, financial condition, or results of operations. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the Company has correctly identified and appropriately assessed all factors affecting its business or that information publicly available with respect to these matters is complete and correct.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur financial and operating performance may be adversely affected by epidemics and other health related issues.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has experienced and could continue to experience disruptions to its business, its operations, the delivery of its products and customer demand for its products, including the following:\n\u00b7\nThe broader economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including resurgences, may continue to result in unfavorable operating earnings and cash flow generation in the months to follow. Current global economic conditions are highly volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in economic slowdowns that have caused and are likely to continue to cause contractions in some or all the markets we serve, which has led to and may continue to lead to decreased demand for the Company\u2019s products, which in turn has, and may continue to negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results. Other macroeconomic factors also remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, including economic uncertainty related to the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union, and overall economic slowdowns, could reduce the Company\u2019s sales or erode operating margin, in either case reducing earnings. In addition, volatile global economic conditions may cause foreign exchange rate fluctuations, which could result in increases or decreases in earnings and may adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s assets outside the United States. Increased pricing in response to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on demand for the Company\u2019s products, which would affect sales and profits. Exchange rate fluctuations could also increase pricing pressure and impair the ability of the Company\u2019s products to compete with products imported from regions with favorable exchange rates.\n\u00b7\nShutdowns and other restrictions imposed to slow the spread and resurgence of COVID-19 have impacted and may continue to impact the prices and availability of certain of the raw materials used in the production of the Company\u2019s products, which could impair the Company\u2019s ability to procure the required raw materials for its operations or increase the cost of manufacturing its products. The Company may be unable to pass increases in the cost of raw materials on to its customers and could experience reductions to its profit margins. Also, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair the Company\u2019s ability to meet production requirements in a timely manner or at all.\n\u00b7\nThe Company\u2019s management has been focused on mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees and operations, which has required and will continue to require a substantial investment of time and resources. This has resulted and can be expected to continue to result in a diversion of management attention and resources away from strategic initiatives, new business opportunities, potential acquisitions, and the overall profitability of our business, and the Company cannot predict how long this may continue.\n\u00b7\nThe economic downturn has resulted and could continue to result in the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets exceeding their fair value, which has required and could continue to require the Company to recognize asset impairment.\n\u00b7\nTo the extent the Company draws under the revolving portion of the Credit Agreement, debt of the Company would increase. Such an increase in indebtedness could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results or ability to incur additional debt and could negatively impact credit ratings. The continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including any resurgences, could also negatively impact the Company\u2019s compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement or the interest rate of borrowings under the Credit Agreement. In addition, as a result of the risks described above, the Company may in the future be required to raise additional debt or equity financing, and the availability, terms and cost of such financing would depend on, among other things, global economic conditions, conditions in the global financing markets, trading prices of the Company\u2019s common stock, the credit ratings of the Company, and the outlook for the industries in which the Company operates, all of which could be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the extent of any resurgences. There can be no assurance that such financing would be available on acceptable terms, in sufficient quantities, or at all.\n\u00b7\nPension plan funded status, the ratio of plan assets over plan liabilities, is largely influenced by current market conditions. To the extent asset returns and interest rates, which are used to discount future plan benefits, change from prior measurement periods, the plan\u2019s funded ratio has the potential to change significantly.\nIndebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.\nAs of January 1, 2022, the Company had $71,314,000 in total consolidated indebtedness. Subject to restrictions contained in the Credit Agreement, the Company may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness incurred to finance acquisitions. The level of indebtedness and servicing costs associated with that indebtedness could have important effects on our operation and business strategy. For example, the indebtedness could:\n\u00b7\nPlace the Company at a competitive disadvantage relative to the Company\u2019s competitors, some of which have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources;\n\u00b7\nLimit the Company\u2019s ability to borrow additional funds;\n\u00b7\nLimit the Company\u2019s ability to complete future acquisitions;\n\u00b7\nLimit the Company\u2019s ability to pay dividends;\n\u00b7\nLimit the Company\u2019s ability to make capital expenditures; and\n\u00b7\nIncrease the Company\u2019s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to make scheduled principal payments, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy other debt obligations will depend upon future operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond the Company\u2019s control. In addition, there can be no assurance that future borrowings or the issuance of equity would be available to the Company on favorable terms for the payment or refinancing of the Company\u2019s debt. If the Company is unable to service its indebtedness, the business, financial condition, and results of operation would be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s credit facility contains covenants requiring the Company to achieve certain financial and operations results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. The Company\u2019s ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in its credit facility may be affected by events beyond our control, and the Company may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or the Company\u2019s inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in our credit facility could result in an event of default under such credit facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facility and/or the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our credit facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, the Company\u2019s assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our credit facility or the Company\u2019s other indebtedness.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s growth strategy involves expanding sales of its products into foreign markets. There is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s products will be accepted by foreign customers or how long it may take to develop sales of the Company\u2019s products in these foreign markets.\nThe phaseout of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with a different reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d) (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it would phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. In December 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration (the \u201cIBA\u201d) announced a market consultation regarding the extension of US dollar LIBOR tenors through June 30, 2023, which the FCA supports. On March 5, 2021, the IBA released its feedback statement reporting the results of the market consultation. Pursuant to its feedback statement, the IBA intends to cease publication of all settings of non-US dollar LIBOR and only the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings on December 31, 2021, with the publication of the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings being discontinued after June 30, 2023. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), a financial industry group convened by the Federal Reserve Board, has recommended the use of SOFR to replace LIBOR. The difference between LIBOR and SOFR is that LIBOR is a forward-looking rate which means the interest rate is set at the beginning of the period with payment due at the end. SOFR is a backward-looking overnight rate which has implications for how interest and other payments are based. Changes in the method of calculating the replacement of LIBOR with a fallback rate (effectively SOFR plus a spread adjustment) will become effective in June 2023 unless adopted earlier. The effect of this change is still unknown and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flow, and liquidity.\nRisks Related to Competition and Global Operations\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to risks associated with conducting business overseas.\nInternational operations could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, differing intellectual property rights and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies could result in increases or decreases in earnings and may adversely affect the value of the Company\u2019s assets outside the United States. The Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations. These trade agreements could impose requirements that adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, such as, but not limited to, setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into the Company\u2019s key markets in North America.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the United States or other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require the Company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial conditions, or results of operations.\nThe Company is also subject to the impacts of political, economic, and social instability. For example, the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d was completed on December 31, 2020. There remains significant uncertainty about the impact of Brexit on the free movement of goods, services, and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union, and Brexit could result in increased legal and regulatory complexities, as well as potential higher costs of conducting business in Europe. The uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal and its consequences, as well as any deterioration in economic conditions, could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence, and the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and retail products, including our products. Any of these effects, among others, could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAdditionally, Brexit has contributed to the volatility of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which the Company conducts business. Because the Company translates revenue denominated in foreign currency into U.S. dollars for its financial statements, during periods of a volatile U.S. dollar, the Company\u2019s reported earnings from foreign operations are affected. As a result of Brexit, there may be further periods of volatility in the currencies in which the Company conducts business.\nSupply chain disruptions, delays in production, and forecast inaccuracies could affect our ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, result in excess inventory, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRaw materials needed to manufacture products are obtained from numerous suppliers. Under normal market conditions, these raw materials are readily available on the open market from a variety of producers. However, from time to time, the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate due to the impact of inflation, as well as changes in existing and expected rates of inflation, which could impair the Company\u2019s ability to procure the required raw materials for its operations or increase the cost of manufacturing its products. If the price of raw materials increases, the Company may be unable to pass these increases on to its customers and could experience reductions to its profit margins. Additionally, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair the Company\u2019s ability to meet production requirements in a timely manner or at all.\nThe Company faces active global competition and if it does not compete effectively, its business may suffer.\nThe Company encounters competition in all its business operations, and imports from Asia and Latin America with favorable currency exchange rates and low-cost labor have resulted in pricing pressure. The Company competes with other companies that offer comparable products or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses. To remain profitable and defend market share, the Company must continue to offer high quality custom engineered products on a timely basis, deploy internal engineering resources, maintain cost-effective manufacturing capabilities through its wholly owned Asian subsidiaries, expand its product lines through product development and acquisitions, and maintain sufficient inventory for fast turnaround of customer orders. The Company may not be able to compete effectively on all these fronts and with all its competitors, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins.\nIn addition, the Company may have to reduce prices on its products and services, or make other concessions, to stay competitive and retain market share. Price reductions taken by the Company in response to customer and competitive pressures, as well as price reductions and promotional actions taken to drive demand that may not result in anticipated sales levels, could also negatively impact the Company\u2019s business.\nIf tariffs on imported Chinese products are further expanded to include additional products and the tariff is reinstated to 25%, our cost of raw materials may increase, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company obtains raw materials used in the production of its products from domestic, Asian affiliated and nonaffiliated sources. On January 15, 2020, the U.S. and China signed the U.S.-China Phase One trade deal which, among other things, rolls back tariffs on $120 billion of Chinese products from 15% to 7.5% effective February 14, 2020. The U.S. agreed not to proceed with the 15% tariffs on $160 billion of consumer goods which were scheduled to take effect December 15, 2019. However, the 25% tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports will remain in effect subject to further reductions depending on the progress of future negotiations. If China does not follow through on its agreed upon commitments and tariffs are reinstated on $550 billion of Chinese products at the 25% rate, it could result in a loss of business and possible reduced margins for the Company if the tariffs cannot be fully offset by higher selling prices.\nChanges in competition in the markets that the Company services could impact revenues and earnings.\nAny change in competition may result in lost market share or reduced prices, which could result in reduced profits and margins. This may impair the ability to grow or even maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. The loss of certain customers could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations until such business is replaced, and no assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions and Organic Growth\nThe inability to develop new products could limit growth.\nDemand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new competitive products at favorable profit margins could adversely affect the Company\u2019s performance and prospects for future growth, and the Company would not be positioned to maintain current levels of revenues and earnings. The uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products, such as the market demands and the costs of development and production, may impede the successful development and introduction of new products. Acceptance of the new products may not meet sales expectations due to several factors, such as the Company\u2019s potential inability to accurately predict market demand or to resolve technical issues in a timely and cost-effective manner. Additionally, the inability to develop new products on a timely basis could result in the loss of business to competitors.\nThe inability to identify or complete acquisitions could limit growth.\nThe Company\u2019s future growth may partly depend on its ability to acquire and successfully integrate new businesses. The Company intends to seek additional acquisition opportunities, both to expand into new markets and to enhance the Company\u2019s position in existing markets. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate terms, obtain financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses or expand into new markets. Once acquired, operations may not achieve anticipated levels of revenues or profitability.\nAcquisitions involve risk, including difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. Although the Company\u2019s management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular transaction, there can be no assurances that the Company\u2019s management will properly ascertain all such risks. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted, and future acquisitions could result in the incurrence of substantial debt and other expenses. Future acquisitions may also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities. Difficulties encountered with acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions of any businesses we may acquire in the future.\nWe regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, and the success of any such acquisitions depends on our ability to combine the acquired business with our existing business in a manner that does not disrupt our and the acquired business\u2019s ongoing relationships with customers, suppliers, and employees. Our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, including risk of impairment; (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into the Company simultaneously and on schedule or to achieve expected synergies and (iii) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, cybersecurity and compliance issues, labor relations difficulties or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, or insurance or indemnities.\nRisks Related to Technology and Information Security\nOur technology is important to the Company\u2019s success and the failure to protect this technology could put the Company at a competitive disadvantage.\nSome of the Company\u2019s products rely on proprietary technology; therefore, the Company believes that the development and protection of intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions are important to the future success of its business. Despite the Company\u2019s efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use the Company\u2019s products or technology. Actions to enforce these rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and the Company makes no assurances that any such actions will be successful.\nIn addition to the United States, we have applied for intellectual property protection in other jurisdictions with respect to certain innovations and new products, product features, and processes. The laws of certain foreign countries in which we do business, or contemplate doing business in the future, do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as U.S. law. As a result, these factors could weaken our competitive advantage with respect to our products, services, and brands in foreign jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our financial performance. We may also encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our licensed and owned intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions. For example, China currently affords less protection to a company\u2019s intellectual property than some other jurisdictions. As such, the lack of strong patent and other intellectual property protection in China may significantly increase our vulnerability regarding unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property and undermine our competitive position. Proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business.\nThe Company relies on information and technology for many of its business operations, which could fail and cause disruption to the Company\u2019s business operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business operations are dependent upon information technology networks and systems to securely transmit, process and store electronic information and to communicate among its locations around the world and with clients and vendors. A shut-down of, or inability to access, one or more of the Company\u2019s facilities, a power outage, or a failure of one or more of the Company\u2019s information technology, telecommunications or other systems could significantly impair the Company\u2019s ability to perform such functions on a timely basis. Computer viruses, cyberattacks, other external hazards and human error could result in the misappropriation of assets or sensitive information, corruption of data or operational disruption. If sustained or repeated, such a business interruption, system failure, service denial or data loss and damage could result in a deterioration of the Company\u2019s ability to write and process orders, provide customer service, or perform other necessary business functions.\nA breach in the security of the Company\u2019s software could harm its reputation, result in a loss of current and potential customers, and subject the Company to material claims, which could materially harm our operating results and financial condition.\nIf the Company\u2019s security measures are breached, an unauthorized party may obtain access to the Company\u2019s data or users\u2019 or customers\u2019 data. In addition, cyber-attacks and similar acts could lead to interruptions and delays in customer processing or a loss or breach of a customer\u2019s data. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm the Company\u2019s business is likely to increase as the Company expands the number of web-based products we offer, the services we provide, and our global operations.\nRegulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the United States and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with the Company\u2019s data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that the Company change its data practices, which could have an adverse effect on its business and results of operations.\nAny security breaches for which the Company is, or is perceived to be, responsible, in whole or in part, could subject us to legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations, which could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and result in significant litigation costs and damage awards or settlement amounts. Any imposition of liability, particularly liability that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of insurance coverage, could materially harm our operating results and financial condition. Security breaches also could cause the Company to lose current and potential customers, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Moreover, the Company may be required to expend significant financial and other resources to further protect against security breaches or to rectify problems caused by any security breach.\nLitigation, Compliance and Regulatory Risks\nDelays in, or disagreements with the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm regarding, the Company\u2019s evaluation of its internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Company\u2019s stock or its borrowing ability. In addition, future changes in operating conditions could result in inadequate internal control over financial reporting.\nThe Company is an \u201caccelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act and is thus required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Section 404 requires the Company to include in its report management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal period for which the Company is filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K. This report must also include disclosure of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that the Company has identified. Additionally, the Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm is required to issue a report on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting and their evaluation of the operating effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. The Company\u2019s assessment requires it to make subjective judgments, and the independent registered public accounting firm may not agree with the Company\u2019s assessment. If the Company or its independent registered public accounting firm were unable to complete the assessments within the period prescribed by Section 404 and thus be unable to conclude that the internal control over financial reporting is effective, investors could lose confidence in the Company\u2019s reported financial information, which could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock or impact the Company\u2019s borrowing ability. In addition, changes in operating conditions and changes in compliance with policies and procedures currently in place may result in inadequate internal control over financial reporting in the future.\nEnvironmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase the Company\u2019s expenses and adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nThe Company\u2019s operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. These laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and sanctions for violations and could require the installation of pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit pollution emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. The Company must conform its operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in the countries in which the Company\u2019s businesses operate as these requirements change.\nThe Company uses and generates hazardous substances and wastes in its operations and, as a result, could be subject to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and to claims alleging personal injury. The Company has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, costs relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations. In connection with the Company\u2019s acquisitions, the Company may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which it may not be aware of at the time of acquisition. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require the Company to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in climate may increase the frequency and intensity of adverse weather patterns and may negatively impact our business.\nNatural disasters, changes in climate, and geo-political events could materially adversely affect our financial performance. The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tropical storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, cyclones, typhoons, weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornadoes, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, severe changes in climate and geo-political events, such as war, civil unrest or terrorist attacks in a country in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nThe Company could be subject to litigation, which could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nFrom time to time, the Company\u2019s operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, and environmental and employment matters, which are defended and settled in the ordinary course of business. Any litigation to which the Company may be subject could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, or results of operations. See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings of this Form 10-K for a discussion of current litigation.\nThe Company could be subject to additional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to income tax laws of the United States, its states, and municipalities and those of other foreign jurisdictions in which the Company has business operations. These laws are complex and subject to interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment and interpretation are required in determining the Company\u2019s worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, transactions arise where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although the Company believes that our tax estimates are reasonable, the outcome of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals. Based on the status of a given tax audit or related litigation, a material effect on the Company\u2019s income tax provision or net income may result during the period or periods from the initial recognition of a particular matter in the Company\u2019s reported financial results to the final closure of that tax audit or settlement of related litigation when the ultimate tax and related cash flow is known with certainty.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets may become impaired, which could require a significant charge to earnings be recognized.\nUnder accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually. Future operating results used in the assumptions, such as sales or profit forecasts, may not materialize, and the Company has been and could in the future be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the financial statements during the period in which any impairment is determined, resulting in an unfavorable impact on our results of operations. Approximately $1.0 million of goodwill was impaired and written off in December 2020 in connection with closing the operations of Eberhard Hardware Manufacturing Ltd. In Ontario, Canada (\u201cEberhard Hardware\u201d).\nThe Company may need additional capital in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nFrom time-to-time, the Company has historically relied on outside financing to fund expanded operations, capital expenditure programs and acquisitions. The Company may require additional capital in the future to fund operations or strategic opportunities. The Company cannot be assured that additional financing will be available on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, the terms of available financing may place limits on the Company\u2019s financial and operating flexibility. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future, the Company may not be able to expand or acquire complementary businesses and may not be able to continue to develop new products or otherwise respond to changing business conditions or competitive pressures.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price may become highly volatile.\nThe Company\u2019s stock price may change dramatically when buyers seeking to purchase shares of the Company\u2019s common stock exceed the shares available on the market, or when there are no buyers to purchase shares of the Company\u2019s common stock when shareholders are trying to sell their shares.\nThe Company depends on key management and technical personnel, the loss of whom could harm its businesses.\nThe Company depends on key management and technical personnel. The loss of one or more key employees could materially and adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s success also depends on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales and marketing and management personnel necessary for the maintenance and expansion of its activities. The Company faces strong competition for such personnel and may not be able to attract or retain such personnel. In addition, when the Company experiences periods with little or no profits, a decrease in compensation based on profits may make it difficult to attract and retain highly qualified personnel.\nTo attract and retain executives and other key employees, the Company must provide a competitive compensation package. If the Company\u2019s profits decrease, or if the Company\u2019s total compensation package is not viewed as competitive, the Company\u2019s ability to attract, retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened. The failure to successfully hire and retain executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations.\nThe Company may not be able to reach acceptable terms for contracts negotiated with its labor unions and be subject to work stoppages or disruption of production.\nDuring 2022, union contracts covering approximately 11% of the Company\u2019s total workforce will expire. The Company has been successful in negotiating new contracts over the years but cannot guarantee that will continue. Failure to negotiate new union contracts could result in the disruption of production, inability to deliver product, or a number of unforeseen circumstances, any of which could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nDeterioration in the creditworthiness of several major customers could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIncluded as a significant asset on the Company\u2019s balance sheet are accounts receivable from our customers. If several large customers become insolvent or are otherwise unable to pay for products or become unwilling or unable to make payments in a timely manner, it could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition.\nAlthough the Company is not dependent on any one customer, deterioration in several large customers at the same time could have an unfavorable material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations or financial condition. One customer exceeded 10% of total accounts receivable for 2021 and one customer exceeded 10% of total accounts receivable for 2020.\nThe Company\u2019s operating results may fluctuate, which makes the results of operations difficult to predict and could cause the results to fall short of expectations.\nThe Company\u2019s operating results may fluctuate because of several factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing the Company\u2019s operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and past results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Quarterly, year to date, and annual costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues may differ significantly from historical or projected levels. Future operating results may fall below expectations. These types of events could cause the price of the Company\u2019s stock to fall.\nNew or existing U.S. or foreign laws could subject the Company to claims or otherwise impact the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of laws in both the U.S. and foreign countries that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort, and can subject the Company to claims or other remedies.", "PERMNO": 31480, "SIC": 3420, "TIC": "EML"}
