RISK FACTORS.\nRisks relating to our business, operations and industry\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, has negatively affected our stock price, and may do so in the future.\nIn March 2020, COVID-19 was categorized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The outbreak and preventative or protective actions that governments, corporations, individuals or we may take to contain the virus may result in a period of reduced operations and business disruption for us and our suppliers, subcontractors, customers and other third parties with which we do business. The effects of the outbreak and related actions, including if significant portions of our or our suppliers\u2019 workforce are unable to work effectively due to facilities closures, illnesses, quarantines, government actions or other restrictions, may therefore hinder or delay our production capabilities and otherwise impede our ability to perform on our obligations to our customers, and may also result in increased costs to us. Any costs associated with the COVID-19 outbreak may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance. The outbreak and related actions may also result in reduced customer demand or limit the ability of customers to perform, including making timely payments to us. Our transportation agency customers are experiencing reduced revenue and funding from multiple sources which could disrupt or delay future orders. The vast majority of revenue from our CTS businesses is earned under fixed-price contracts. However, a portion of our CTS revenue is earned based upon transit ridership. As such, reductions in ridership caused by COVID-19 have negatively impacted our operating results and will continue to do so until ridership levels return to those prevalent prior to the outbreak. Any of these factors, depending on the severity and duration of the outbreak and its effects, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 outbreak and resulting actions have negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, our stock price and the U.S. and global financial markets generally.\nThe total financial impact of these factors cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on government contracts for substantially all of our revenues and the loss of government contracts or a delay or decline in funding of existing or future government contracts could decrease our backlog or adversely affect our sales and cash flows and our ability to fund our growth.\nOur revenues from contracts, directly or indirectly, with foreign and U.S. state, regional and local governmental agencies represented substantially all of our total revenues in fiscal year 2020. As a result of the concentration of business with governmental agencies, we are vulnerable to adverse changes in our revenues, income and cash flows if a significant number of our government contracts, subcontracts or prospects are delayed or canceled for budgetary or other reasons.\nThe factors that could cause us to lose these contracts and could decrease our backlog or otherwise materially harm our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations include:\n\u25cf budget constraints affecting government spending generally, or specific departments or agencies such as U.S. or foreign defense and transportation agencies and regional transportation agencies, and changes in fiscal policies or a reduction of available funding or government appropriations delays;\n\u25cf re-allocation of government resources as the result of actual or threatened terrorism or hostile activities or for other reasons;\n\u25cf Congress and the executive branch of the U.S. government may reach an impasse on increasing the national debt limit or passing the fiscal year budget, which could result in a full or partial shutdown of the U.S. government, restrict the U.S. government\u2019s ability to pay contractors for prior work, cause the termination or suspension of our contracts with the U.S. government, provide for automatic cuts to the U.S. defense budget, require us to furlough affected employees for an indefinite time, terminate or suspend subcontracts, or incur contract wind-down costs;\n\u25cf Congress and such foreign governments do not always enact spending bills by the beginning of the new fiscal year. Such delays leave the affected agencies under-funded delaying their ability to contract. Future delays and uncertainties in funding could impose additional business risks on us;\n\u25cf curtailment of governments\u2019 use of outsourced service providers and governments\u2019 in-sourcing of certain services;\n\u25cf In addition, the DoD has an increased emphasis on awarding contracts to small businesses and awarding shorter duration contracts, each of which has the potential to reduce the amount of revenue we could otherwise earn from such contracts;\n\u25cf the adoption of new laws or regulations pertaining to government procurement;\n\u25cf suspension or prohibition from contracting with or impairment of our reputation or relationships with the government or any significant agency with which we conduct business;\n\u25cf increased aggressiveness by the government in seeking rights in technical data, computer software, and computer software documentation that we deliver under a contract, which may result in \u201cleveling the playing field\u201d for competitors on follow-on procurements;\nIn addition, some of our international work is done at the request and at the expense of the U.S. government and its agencies. Therefore, risks associated with performing work for the U.S. government and its agencies may also apply to our international contracts.\nOur contracts with government agencies may be unilaterally terminated or modified prior to completion, which could adversely affect our business.\nGovernment contracts typically contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that give the government agencies rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts, including providing the government agency with the ability to unilaterally:\n\u25cf terminate or reduce the value of our existing contracts;\n\u25cf modify the terms and conditions in our existing contracts;\n\u25cf control and potentially prohibit the export of our products;\n\u25cf cancel, delay or decline to exercise an option to extend existing multi-year contracts and related orders if the necessary funds for contract performance for any subsequent year are not appropriated; and\n\u25cf claim rights in technologies and systems invented, developed or produced by us.\nMany agencies with which we contract can terminate their contracts with us for convenience, and in that event, we generally may recover only our incurred or committed costs, settlement expenses and profit on the work completed prior to termination. If an agency terminates a contract with us for default, we may be denied any recovery and may be liable for excess costs incurred by the agency in procuring undelivered items from an alternative source. We may receive show-cause or cure notices under contracts that, if not addressed to the agency\u2019s satisfaction, could give the agency the right to terminate those contracts for default or to cease procuring our services under those contracts.\nIn the event that any of our contracts were to be terminated or adversely modified, there may be significant adverse effects on our revenues, operating costs and income that would not be recoverable.\nWe have made assumptions concerning behavior by transportation authorities which may not hold true over time.\nIn our transportation business we have made certain assumptions that support the growth of the business. For example, we have assumed that governments will continue to charge passengers for using public transit. We have also assumed that transportation agencies will continue to outsource operations and services. Should these assumptions not hold true, our transportation business could experience a material loss of business.\nFailure to retain existing contracts or obtain new contracts under competitive bidding processes may adversely affect our revenue.\nWe obtain most of our contracts through a competitive bidding process, and substantially all of the business that we expect to seek in the foreseeable future likely will be subject to a competitive bidding process. Competitive bidding presents a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf the need to compete against companies or teams of companies with more financial and marketing resources and more experience in bidding on and performing major contracts than we have;\n\u25cf the need to compete against companies or teams of companies that may be long-term, entrenched incumbents for a particular contract for which we are competing and that have, as a result, greater domain expertise and better customer relations;\n\u25cf the need to compete to retain existing contracts that have in the past been awarded to us on a sole-source basis or as to which we have been incumbent for a substantial period of time;\n\u25cf the reduction of margins achievable under any contracts awarded to us;\n\u25cf the expense and delay that may arise if our competitors protest or otherwise challenge new contract awards;\n\u25cf the need to bid on some programs in advance of the completion of their design, which may result in higher R&D expenditures, unforeseen technological difficulties, or increased costs which lower our profitability;\n\u25cf the substantial cost and managerial time and effort, including design, development and marketing activities, necessary to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us;\n\u25cf the need to develop, introduce and implement new and enhanced solutions to our customers\u2019 needs; and\n\u25cf the need to accurately estimate the resources and cost structure that will be required to perform any fixed-price contract that we are awarded.\nIf we are unable to win particular contracts that are awarded through the competitive bidding process, we may not be able to operate in the market for services that are provided under those contracts for a number of years. If we win a contract, and upon expiration the customer requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently a competitive rebidding process and there can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract.\nAs a result of the complexity and scheduling of contracting with government agencies, we occasionally incur costs before receiving contractual funding by the government agency. In some circumstances, we may not be able to recover these costs in whole or in part under subsequent contractual actions.\nThe customers currently serviced by our CTS segment are finite in number. The loss of any one of these customers, or the failure to win replacement awards upon expiration of contracts with such customers, could adversely impact us.\nIf we are unable to consistently retain existing contracts or win new contract awards, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nGovernment audits of our contracts could result in a material change to our earnings, have a negative effect on our cash position following an audit adjustment or adversely affect our ability to conduct future business.\nU.S. government agencies, including the DoD, routinely audit and review a contractor\u2019s performance on government contracts, contract costs, indirect rates and pricing practices, and compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards. This could lead to adjustments to our contract costs, and any costs found to be unreasonable, improperly allocated, or unallowable under government cost accounting standards or contractual provisions will not be reimbursed. The government could also potentially refuse to agree to our proposed unit prices if the auditing agency does not find them to be \u201cfair and reasonable.\u201d The government may also demand that we refund what the government claims are any excess proceeds we received on particular items where the government claims we did not properly disclose required information in negotiating the unit price.\nThe DoD, in particular, also reviews the adequacy of, and compliance with, our internal control systems and policies, including our purchasing, accounting, financial capability, pricing, labor pool, overhead rate and management information systems. Our failure to obtain an \u201cadequate\u201d determination of our various accounting and management internal control systems from the responsible U.S. government agency could significantly and adversely affect our business, including our ability to bid on new contracts and our competitive position in the bidding process. Failure to comply with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards could also result in the U.S. government imposing penalties and sanctions against us, including suspension of payments and increased government scrutiny that could delay or adversely affect our ability to invoice and receive timely payment on contracts or perform contracts, or could result in suspension or debarment from competing for contracts with the U.S. government. In addition, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us, whether or not true.\nIn addition, transit authorities have the right to audit our work under their respective contracts. If, as the result of an adverse audit finding, we were suspended, debarred, proposed for debarment, or otherwise prohibited from contracting with the U.S. government, any significant government agency or a transit authority terminated its contract with us, or our reputation or relationship with such agencies and authorities was impaired or they otherwise ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business done with us, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business and stock price may be adversely affected if our internal control over financial reporting is not effective.\nThe accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, incur incremental compliance costs, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to restate our financial statements, and our results of operations, our share price and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur operating margins may decline under our fixed-price contracts if we fail to accurately estimate the time and resources necessary to satisfy our obligations.\nApproximately 95% of our revenues in fiscal year 2020 were from fixed-price contracts under which we bear the risk of cost overruns. Our profits are adversely affected if our costs under these contracts exceed the assumptions we used in bidding for the contract. Sometimes we are required to fix the price for a contract before the project specifications are finalized, which increases the risk that we will incorrectly price these contracts. The complexity of many of our engagements makes accurately estimating the time and resources required more difficult.\nOur business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.\nWe face cyber threats, threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, including executives, and terrorist acts, as well as the potential for business disruptions associated with information technology or internal system failures (including network, software or hardware failures), damaging weather or other acts of nature, and pandemics or other public health crises (including the current COVID-19 outbreak), which may adversely affect our business.\nWe routinely experience cyber security threats, threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to our company\u2019s sensitive information, as do our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and joint venture partners. We may experience similar security threats at customer sites that we operate and manage as a contractual requirement. Such events could cause loss of data and interruptions or delays in our business, cause us to incur remediation costs, subject us to claims and damage our reputation.\nIn addition, we could be impacted by cyber security threats or other disruptions or vulnerabilities found in products we use or in the systems of our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and joint venture partners that are used in connection with our business. Although we work cooperatively with these third parties to seek to minimize the impacts of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions, in addition to our internal processes, procedures and systems, we must also rely on the safeguards put in place by those entities.\nThe costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully mitigated by insurance or other means. Occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our internal operations, the services we provide to customers, loss of competitive advantages derived from our R&D efforts, early obsolescence of our products and services, our future financial results, our reputation or our stock price. The occurrence of any of these events could also result in civil or criminal liabilities.\nOur results of operations have historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future, which could adversely affect our financial position or our stock price.\nOur results of operations are affected by factors such as the unpredictability of contract awards due to the long procurement process for most of our products and services, the potential fluctuation of governmental agency budgets, any timing differences between our work performed and costs incurred under a contract and our ability to recognize revenue and generate cash flow from such contract, the time it takes for the new markets we target to develop and for us to develop and provide products and services for those markets, competition and general economic conditions. Our contract type/product mix and unit volume, our ability to keep expenses within budget and our pricing affect our operating margins. Significant growth in costs to complete our contracts may adversely affect our results of operations in future periods and cause our financial results to fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis. Consequently, we do not believe that comparison of our results of operations from period to period is necessarily meaningful or predictive of our likely future results of operations. In future financial periods our operating results or cash flows may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors, which could cause the price of our stock to decline significantly.\nThe terms of our financing arrangements may restrict our financial and operational flexibility, including our ability to invest in new business opportunities.\nOn March 27, 2020, we executed a Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) with a group of financial institutions. The Credit Facility provided for a new term loan in the aggregate amount of $450.0 million (the \u201cTerm Loan\u201d) and increased our existing revolving line of credit limit (the \u201cRevolving Line of Credit\u201d) from $800.0 million to $850.0 million. The commitments under the Credit Facility will mature on March 27, 2025. At September 30, 2020, we had $444.4 million of borrowings under our Term Loan and $209.0 million of borrowings under our Revolving Line of Credit. Letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility totaled $93.1 million at September 30, 2020, which reduced our available line of credit to $547.9 million. The $93.1 million of letters of credit includes both financial letters of credit and performance guarantees.\nThe terms of the Credit Facility contain financial covenants setting a maximum total ratio of debt to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and a minimum interest coverage ratio. In addition, the terms contain covenants that restrict, among other things, our ability to sell assets, incur indebtedness, make investments, grant liens, pay dividends and make other restricted payments. As of September 30, 2020, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility.\nAdditionally, we may continue to use alternative financing structures in order to fund certain projects related to the redevelopment of our corporate campus. Any such financing arrangements may further restrict our financial and operational flexibility.\nOur corporate campus redevelopment plan may be subject to certain unanticipated financial, environmental, regulatory, and construction risks that are beyond the scope of our typical business activities.\nWe are in the process of developing our corporate campus in San Diego and this redevelopment project may be subject to various risks associated with real property development including but not limited to financing, compliance with environmental laws and regulations, obtaining permits and other governmental approvals, regulatory compliance, changes in market conditions, labor and material shortages, legal claims, delays in completion, distracting management\u2019s and employees\u2019 attention and resources, natural disasters, cost overruns, socio-political risks, and construction defects.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to develop new products, systems and services that achieve market acceptance in our current and future markets.\nBoth our commercial and government businesses are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards. We believe that, in order to remain competitive in the future, we will need to continue to develop new products, systems and services, and in some cases transition to a product-oriented approach as opposed to our historical, project-oriented approach, all of which will require the investment of significant financial resources. The need to make these expenditures could divert our attention and resources from other projects, and we cannot be sure that these expenditures ultimately will lead to the timely development of new products, systems or services. In recent years, we have spent an amount equal to approximately 3% to 4% of our annual sales on internal R&D efforts. There can be no assurances that this percentage will not increase should we require increased innovations to successfully compete in the markets we serve. We may also experience delays in completing development and introducing certain new products, systems or services in the future due to their design complexity. Any delays could result in increased costs of development or redirect resources from other projects. In addition, we cannot provide assurances that the markets for our products, systems or services will develop as we currently anticipate, which could significantly reduce our revenue and harm our business. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our competitors will not develop competing products, systems or services that gain market acceptance in advance of ours, or that cause our existing products, systems or services to become non-competitive or obsolete, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we deliver products or systems with defects, our reputation could be harmed, revenue from, and market acceptance of, our products and systems could decrease and we could expend significant capital and resources as a result of such defects.\nOur products and systems are complex and frequently operate in high-performance, challenging environments. Notwithstanding our internal quality specifications, our products and systems have sometimes contained errors, defects and bugs when introduced. If we deliver products or systems with errors, defects or bugs, our reputation and the market acceptance and sales of our products and systems would be harmed. Further, if our products or systems contain errors, defects or bugs, we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to alleviate such problems and incur significant costs for product recalls and inventory write-offs. Defects could also lead to product liability lawsuits against us or against our customers, and could also damage our reputation. We have agreed to indemnify our customers in some circumstances against liability arising from defects in our products and systems. In the event of a successful product liability claim, we could be obligated to pay damages significantly in excess of our product liability insurance limits.\nOur development contracts may be difficult for us to comply with and may expose us to third-party claims for damages.\nWe are often party to government and commercial contracts involving the development of new products and systems. These contracts typically contain strict performance obligations and project milestones. We cannot assure you we will comply with these performance obligations or meet these project milestones in the future. If we are unable to comply with these performance obligations or meet these milestones, our customers may terminate these contracts and, under some circumstances, recover damages or other penalties from us. If other parties elect to terminate their contracts or seek damages from us, it could materially harm our business and negatively impact our stock price.\nOur revenues could be less than expected if we are not able to deliver services or products as scheduled due to disruptions in supply.\nSince our internal manufacturing capacity is limited, we use third parties to supply certain products or components we use. While we use care in selecting our suppliers, we have less control over the reliability of supply, quality and price of products or components than if we manufactured them. In some cases, we obtain products from a sole supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Consequently, we risk disruptions in our supply of key products and components if our suppliers fail or are unable to perform because of shortages in raw materials, operational problems, strikes, natural disasters, financial condition or other factors. We may have disputes with our suppliers arising from, among other things, the quality of products and services or customer concerns about the supplier. If any of our suppliers fail to timely meet their contractual obligations or have regulatory compliance or other problems, our ability to fulfill our obligations may be jeopardized. Economic downturns can adversely affect a supplier\u2019s ability to manufacture or deliver products. Further, suppliers may also be enjoined from manufacturing and distributing products to us as a result of litigation filed by third parties, including intellectual property litigation. If we were to experience difficulty in obtaining certain products, there could be an adverse effect on our results of operations, customer relationships and reputation. Additionally, our suppliers could also increase pricing of their products, which could negatively affect our ability to win contracts by offering competitive prices.\nAny material supply disruptions could adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations under our contracts and could result in cancellation of contracts or purchase orders, penalties, delays in realizing revenues, payment delays, as well as adversely affect our ongoing product cost structure.\nFailure to perform by our subcontractors could materially and adversely affect our contract performance and our ability to obtain future business.\nOur performance of contracts often involves subcontractors, upon which we rely to complete delivery of products or services to our customers. We may have disputes with subcontractors. A failure by a subcontractor to satisfactorily deliver products or services can adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor. Any subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in the customer terminating our contract for default, which could expose us to liability for excess costs of re-procurement by the customer and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for other contracts.\nWe face certain significant risk exposures and potential liabilities that may not be covered adequately by insurance or indemnity.\nWe are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products, systems and services we provide. A significant portion of our business relates to designing, developing, manufacturing, operating and maintaining advanced defense and transportation systems and products. New technologies associated with these systems and products may be untested or unproven. In addition, certain activities in connection with which our training systems are used or our services are provided are inherently dangerous.\nWhile in some circumstances we may receive indemnification from U.S. and foreign governments, and we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance or indemnity may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear substantial costs from an accident or incident. It also is not possible for us to\nobtain insurance to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. Substantial claims resulting from an incident in excess of the indemnification we receive from our insurance coverage could harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, any accident or incident for which we are liable, even if fully insured, could negatively affect our standing with our customers and the public, thereby making it more difficult for us to compete effectively, and could significantly impact the cost and availability of adequate insurance in the future.\nWe may acquire or invest in other companies, which could increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive to our business.\nPart of our strategy involves the acquisition of or investment in other companies and businesses. These acquisitions or investments are made upon analysis and due diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective. These procedures often involve certain assumptions and judgment in determining acquisition price. After acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise which adversely affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Even after careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates.\nAs a result, we may not be able to integrate acquired companies successfully without substantial expense, delay or operational or financial problems. Such expenses, delays or operational or financial problems may include the following:\n\u25cf we may need to divert management resources to integration, which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other more profitable activities;\n\u25cf integration may be difficult as a result of the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations, integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures;\n\u25cf we may not be able to eliminate redundant costs anticipated at the time we select acquisition candidates; and\n\u25cf one or more of our acquisitions may have unexpected liabilities, fraud risk, or adverse operating issues that we fail to discover through our due diligence procedures prior to the acquisition.\nAs a result, the integration of acquired businesses may be costly and may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Acquisitions also could result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from any acquisition, in which case our results of operations, business, and financial condition may suffer.\nRisks relating to our international operations\nOur international business exposes us to additional risks, including exchange rate fluctuations, foreign tax and legal regulations and political or economic instability that could harm our operating results.\nOur international operations subject us to risks associated with operating in and buying or selling products or services in foreign countries, including:\n\u25cf devaluations and fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf changes in foreign laws that adversely affect our ability to sell our products or services or our ability to repatriate profits to the United States;\n\u25cf increases or impositions of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries or joint ventures to us;\n\u25cf increases in investment and other restrictions or compliance with requirements of foreign governments in order to operate in the territory or own the subsidiary including the need to form joint ventures with local in-country partners, expend a portion of the contract locally, offset requirements and others;\n\u25cf costs of compliance with local laws, including labor laws, privacy laws, and import/export regulations;\n\u25cf compliance with applicable U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws, anti-trust/competition laws, anti-money laundering laws and sanctions, including the difficulty of ensuring that our foreign representatives, consultants and partners comply with such laws and sanctions;\n\u25cf export control regulations, trade sanctions, and related policies which govern our ability to supply foreign customers and operate in jurisdictions other than the United States;\n\u25cf the complexity and necessity of using foreign representatives and consultants or being prohibited from such use;\n\u25cf the uncertainty of the ability of foreign customers to finance purchases;\n\u25cf imposition of tariffs or embargoes, export controls and other trade restrictions;\n\u25cf potentially being prohibited from bidding for international work due to perceived conflicts or national security concerns resulting from the significant amount of work we do for the U.S. government and its agencies;\n\u25cf the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise in various countries; and\n\u25cf economic and geopolitical developments and conditions, including ongoing instability in global economies and financial markets, international hostilities, acts of terrorism and governmental reactions, inflation, trade relationships and military and political alliances.\nOur foreign subsidiaries generally enter into contracts and make purchase commitments that are denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, we are exposed to fluctuations in exchange rates, which could have a significant impact on our results of operations. We have no control over the factors that generally affect this risk, such as economic, financial and political events and the supply of and demand for applicable currencies. While we use foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge significant contract sales and purchase commitments that are denominated in foreign currencies, our hedging strategy may not prevent us from incurring losses due to exchange fluctuations.\nRisks relating to legal, regulatory and tax matters\nWe may be liable for civil or criminal penalties under a variety of complex laws and regulations, and changes in governmental regulations could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur businesses must comply with and are affected by various U.S. government and foreign regulations that impact our operating costs, profit margins and our internal organization and operation of our businesses. These regulations affect how we do business and, in some instances, impose added costs. Any changes in applicable laws could adversely affect our business and financial condition. Any material failure to comply with applicable laws could result in contract termination, price or fee reductions or suspension or debarment from contracting. The more significant regulations include:\n\u25cf the Federal Acquisition Regulations and all department and agency supplements, which comprehensively regulate the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts;\n\u25cf the Truth in Negotiations Act and implementing regulations, which require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations;\n\u25cf the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, which control the export of items on the U.S. Munitions Control List administered by the U.S. Department of State;\n\u25cf the Export Administration Regulations which control commercial, dual-use and select defense related articles;\n\u25cf the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives regulations that control the manufacture, possession and sale of firearms and explosive devices and materials;\n\u25cf laws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data;\n\u25cf regulations of state and regional agencies and foreign governments similar to those described above;\n\u25cf the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control;\n\u25cf the Sherman Act and Clayton Act, which proscribe unlawful, anti-competitive conduct and business practices;\n\u25cf the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in other countries in which we operate;\n\u25cf the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act;\n\u25cf healthcare reform laws and regulations, including those enacted under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010;\n\u25cf the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Equal Pay Act and similar state wage and hour laws;\n\u25cf Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and similar state and federal employment laws in the U.S., and in other countries in which we operate;\n\u25cf tax laws and regulations in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate;\n\u25cf privacy laws in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation and any attendant European country legislation:\n\u25cf the civil False Claims Act, which provides for substantial civil penalties and treble damages for violations, including for submission of a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government for payment or approval, and allows private litigants to pursue violations as \u201cwhistleblower\u201d or qui tam actions on behalf of the U.S. government;\n\u25cf the Procurement Integrity Act, which requires evaluation of ethical conflicts surrounding procurement activity and establishing certain employment restrictions for individuals who participate in the procurement process; and\n\u25cf the Small Business Act and the Small Business Administration, size status regulations, which regulate eligibility for performance of government contracts which are set aside for, or a preference is given in the evaluation process if awarded to, specific types of contractors such as small businesses and minority-owned businesses.\nMany of our U.S. government contracts contain organizational conflicts of interest clauses that may limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts.\nIn addition, the U.S. and foreign governments may revise existing contract rules and regulations or adopt new contract rules and regulations at any time and may also face restrictions or pressure regarding the type and amount of services it may obtain from private contractors. Changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or renew contracts under which we currently perform when those contracts are eligible for re-competition. Any new contracting methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to various investigations, claims and litigation that could ultimately be resolved against us.\nThe size, nature and complexity of our business make us susceptible to investigations, claims, and litigation, particularly those involving governments. We are and may become subject to investigations, claims and administrative, civil or criminal litigation globally and across a broad array of matters, including, but not limited to, government contracts, false claims, products liability, fraud, environmental, intellectual property, tax, export/import, anti-corruption, anti-trust, breach of contract, labor, wage and hour, health and safety, employee benefits and plans, including plan administration, and improper payments. These matters could divert financial and management resources; result in fines, penalties, compensatory, treble or other damages or non-monetary relief; and otherwise disrupt our business. Government regulations also provide that certain allegations against a contractor may lead to suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export privileges for a company or one or more of its components. Suspension, debarment, or being proposed for debarment could have a material adverse effect on our company because of our reliance on government contracts and export authorizations. An investigation claim or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could also negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future. Investigations, claims or litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nRisks relating to our human capital\nOur failure to identify, attract and retain qualified technical and management personnel could adversely affect our existing businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to identify, attract or retain qualified technical personnel, including engineers, computer programmers and personnel for our transportation business or with security clearances required for classified work, or management personnel to supervise such activities that are necessary for maintaining and growing our existing businesses, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. A number of our employees maintain a top-secret clearance level. Obtaining and maintaining security clearances for employees involves a lengthy process, and it is difficult to identify, recruit and retain employees who already hold security clearances. If our cleared employees lose or are unable to timely obtain security clearances or we lose a facility clearance, our U.S. government customers may terminate their contracts with us or decide not to renew such contracts upon their expiration. To the extent we are not able to obtain facility security clearances or engage employees with the required security clearances for a particular contract, we will be unable to perform that contract and we may not be able to compete for or win new awards for similar work.\nOur employees or third-party contractors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee and third-party contractor fraud or other misconduct. Employee and third-party contractor misconduct could include intentionally failing to comply with U.S. government procurement regulations, engaging in unauthorized activities, attempting to obtain reimbursement for improper expenses, or submitting falsified time records, which could result in legal proceedings against us, lost contracts or reduced revenues.\nEmployee and third-party contractor misconduct could also involve improper use of our customers\u2019 sensitive or classified information, which could result in regulatory sanctions against us and serious harm to our reputation. Misconduct could also involve making payments, or offering something of value, to government officials or third parties that would expose us to being in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act or similar laws in other countries.\nIt is not always possible to deter employee or third-party contractor misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, alleged or actual employee or third-party contractor misconduct could result in investigations or prosecutions of employees or third-party contractors engaged in the subject activities, which could result in unanticipated consequences or expenses and management distraction for us regardless of whether we are alleged to have any responsibility.\nRisks relating to our intellectual property\nWe may incur significant costs in protecting our intellectual property which could adversely affect our profit margins. Our inability to obtain, maintain and enforce our patents and other proprietary rights could adversely affect our businesses\u2019 prospects and competitive positions.\nWe seek to protect our proprietary technology and inventions through patents and other proprietary-right protection, and also rely on trademark laws to protect our brand. However, we may fail to obtain the intellectual property rights necessary to provide us with a competitive advantage, and any of our owned or licensed intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated.\nWe may also fail to apply for or obtain intellectual property protection in important foreign countries, and the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to obtain or maintain these protections, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our technology and inventions, which could adversely affect our business.\nThe U.S. government, and the DoD in particular, has become more aggressive in seeking rights in all technical data, computer software, and computer software documentation that we may deliver under U.S. government contracts. The U.S. government generally takes the position that it has the right to royalty-free use of technologies that are developed under U.S. government contracts. Thus, we may not have the right to prohibit the U.S. government from using certain technologies developed by us, and we may not be able to prohibit third party companies, including our competitors, from using those technologies in providing products and services to the U.S. government.\nWe may incur significant expense in obtaining, maintaining, defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights. We may fail to take the actions necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and even if we attempt to enforce such rights, we may ultimately be unsuccessful, and such efforts may result in our intellectual property rights being challenged, limited in scope, or declared invalid or unenforceable. Also, some aspects of our business and services may rely on technologies and software developed by or licensed from third parties, and we may not be able to maintain our relationships with such third parties or enter into similar relationships in the future on reasonable terms or at all.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation to remain competitive. We have taken measures to protect our trade secrets and know-how, including seeking to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and advisors, but the measures we have taken may not be sufficient. We generally control and limit access to our product documentation and other proprietary information, but other parties may independently develop our know-how or otherwise obtain access to our technology, which could adversely affect our businesses\u2019 prospects and competitive position.\nAssertions by third parties that we violate their intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThird parties may claim that we, our customers, licensees or parties indemnified by us are infringing upon or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights. Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage or by other parties. Additionally, in recent years, individuals and groups have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies like ours.\nAny claims that we violate a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights can be time consuming and costly to defend and distract management\u2019s attention and resources, even if the claims are without merit. Such claims may also require us to redesign affected products and services, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or providing the affected products and services. Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may not have sufficient financial resources or otherwise be unable to uphold its contractual obligations. If we cannot or do not license the infringed technology on favorable terms or cannot or do not substitute similar technology from another source, our revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.\nRisks relating to our common stock\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nAn active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not be sustained, which could depress the trading price of our common stock.\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares or at all. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, which include:\n\u25cf our quarterly or annual earnings or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u25cf changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who track our common stock or the stocks of our competitors;\n\u25cf failure to meet the expectations of research analysts;\n\u25cf inaccuracy of our guidance regarding future operating results;\n\u25cf new laws or regulations or new interpretations of laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u25cf changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u25cf changes in general conditions in the domestic and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events;\n\u25cf litigation involving our company or investigations or audits by regulators into the operations of our company or our competitors;\n\u25cf strategic action by our competitors; and\n\u25cf sales of common stock by our directors, executive officers and significant shareholders.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. If litigation is instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of Cubic.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that shareholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempt by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult to replace or remove our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u25cf prior to the date of the transaction, an affirmative vote of the holders of at least the majority of our outstanding common stock is required for the approval, adoption or authorization of a business combination;\n\u25cf a prohibition on shareholder action through written consent;\n\u25cf a requirement that special meetings of shareholders be called only by our board of directors or by a committee of our board of directors that has been duly designated to do so by our board of directors;\n\u25cf the authority of our board of directors to issue preferred stock with such terms as our board of directors may determine; and\n\u25cf a requirement for the affirmative vote of the holders of at least the majority of the total voting power of all outstanding shares of our voting stock to amend our amended and restated bylaws, or to amend specific provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nIn addition, Delaware law prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder, generally a person who, together with its affiliates, owns or within the last three years has owned 15% of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested shareholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. Accordingly, Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company.\nAs a result of the rapid accumulation of our stock by an investor, our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan which may impair a takeover attempt and speculation regarding potential transactions or our failure to enter into any transaction at all may cause significant fluctuations in our share price.\nOn September 20, 2020, in response to the rapid accumulation of our stock by an investor, our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan (Rights Plan) and declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of our common stock to shareholders of record on October 1, 2020. The dividend distribution was made to such shareholders on October 1, 2020. In general terms, and subject to certain exceptions, the Rights Plan restricts any person or group of affiliated or associated persons from acquiring, or obtaining the right to acquire, beneficial ownership of 15% (20% in the case of a Passive Institutional Investor, as such term is defined in Rights Plan) or more of shares of our common stock (including certain synthetic equity positions created by derivative securities) (an Acquiring Person), and any person or group of affiliated or associated persons from making a tender offer or exchange offer, the consummation of which would result in a person or group becoming an Acquiring Person. The Rights Plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Company or a large block of our shares of common stock without the approval of our board of directors. The rights will expire on September 19, 2021. With respect to approaches by third parties, there can be no assurance that we will engage in a transaction or take other actions as a result. Speculation regarding the possibility of such a transaction or actions by us may cause our share price to fluctuate significantly. Our failure to engage with such parties, enter into a transaction with any of them or take other actions they request may adversely affect our share price.\nIf we are unable to pay semiannual dividends at the targeted level, our reputation and stock price may be harmed.\nWe have consistently paid cash dividends to our shareholders since 1971, and, in fiscal year 2020, we paid an aggregate of $8.4 million of cash dividends to our shareholders.\nThe dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flows. Our ability to continue to pay semiannual dividends will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our board of directors may, at its discretion, decrease the targeted semiannual dividend amount or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time. Any failure to pay dividends after we have announced our intention to do so may adversely affect our reputation and investor confidence in us, and negatively impact our stock price.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the documents incorporated by reference herein, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are subject to the safe harbor created thereby.

In addition, past financial or operating performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future performance and you should not use our historical performance to anticipate results or future period trends.\nFurther, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and, except as required by applicable law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which factors will arise. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.", "PERMNO": 31077, "SIC": 3578, "TIC": "CUB"}
