These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks described below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d The following is not intended to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties, as it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors.\nCompetitive Industry Conditions We face strong competition from traditional grocery retailers, non-traditional competitors such as supercenters and club stores, as well as from specialty and niche supermarkets, drug stores, dollar stores, convenience stores and restaurants. Increased competition may have an adverse effect on profitability as the result of lower sales, lower gross profits and/or greater operating costs.\nOur ability to attract customers is dependent, in large part, upon a combination of location, quality, price, service, selection and condition of assets. In each of these areas, traditional and non-traditional competitors compete with us and may successfully attract our customers to their stores by aggressively matching or exceeding what we offer. In recent years, many of our competitors have increased their presence in our markets. Our responses to competitive pressure, such as additional promotions and increased advertising, could adversely affect our profitability. We cannot guarantee that our actions will succeed in gaining or maintaining market share. Additionally, we cannot predict how our customers will react to the entrance of certain non-traditional competitors into the grocery retailing business.\nBecause we face intense competition, we need to anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands more effectively than our competitors. We strive to achieve and maintain favorable recognition of our unique private-label brands, effectively market our products to consumers, competitively price our products and maintain and enhance a perception of value for consumers. Finally, we need to source and market our merchandise efficiently and creatively. Failure to accomplish these objectives could impair our ability to compete successfully and adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nLabor Relations A significant majority of our employees are unionized, and our relationship with unions, including labor disputes or work stoppages, could have an adverse impact on our financial results. We are a party to almost 400 collective bargaining agreements, of which 125 are scheduled to expire in 2015. These expiring agreements cover approximately 13% of our union-affiliated employees, primarily the United Food and Commercial Workers union contracts in our Denver division. In future negotiations with labor unions, we expect that health care, pension and wage costs, among other issues, will be important topics for negotiation. If, upon the expiration of such collective bargaining agreements, we are unable to negotiate acceptable contracts with labor unions, it could result in strikes by the affected workers and thereby significantly disrupt our operations. Further, if we are unable to control health care and pension costs provided\nSAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nfor in the collective bargaining agreements, we may experience increased operating costs and an adverse impact on future results of operations.\nProfit Margins Profit margins in the grocery retail industry are narrow. In order to increase or maintain our profit margins, we develop strategies to increase revenues, reduce costs and increase gross margins, such as new marketing programs, new advertising campaigns, productivity improvements, shrink reduction, distribution center efficiencies, energy efficiency programs and other similar strategies. Our failure to achieve forecasted cost reductions, revenue growth or gross margin improvement across the Company could have a material adverse effect on our business. Changes in our product mix also may negatively affect certain financial measures.\nOpening and Remodeling Stores Failure to open and remodel stores as planned could have a material adverse effect on our results. If, as a result of labor relations issues, supply issues or environmental and real estate delays, or other reasons, these capital projects do not stay within the time and financial budgets we have forecasted, our future financial performance could be materially adversely affected. Furthermore, we cannot ensure that the new or remodeled stores will achieve anticipated same-store sales or profit levels.\nFood Safety, Quality and Health Concerns We could be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain food products. Adverse publicity about these types of concerns, whether valid or not, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. The real or perceived sale of contaminated food products by us could result in product liability claims, a loss of consumer confidence and product recalls, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operations.\nCurrent Economic Conditions Our operations and financial performance are affected by economic conditions. While economic conditions have recently improved, there is continued uncertainty about the strength of the economic recovery. If the current economic situation does not continue to improve or if it weakens, consumers may reduce spending, trade down to a less expensive mix of products or trade down to discounters for grocery items, all of which could impact our sales growth. We are unable to predict with certainty if the economy of the United States will continue to improve or the rate at which it will improve. If the economy does not continue to improve or if it weakens, Safeway\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAlbertsons Integration Albertsons' acquisition of the Company is significant, and we may not be able to successfully integrate and combine the operations, management, personnel and technology of Albertsons with our operations. Because of the size and complexity of Albertsons' business, if integration is not managed successfully by our management, we may experience interruptions in our business activities, a deterioration in our employee and customer relationships, increased costs of integration and harm to our reputation with consumers, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects, results of operations and cash flow. We may also experience difficulties in combining corporate cultures, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees. In addition, the integration with Albertsons will impose substantial demands on the management of the combined companies. There is no assurance that the benefits of consolidation will be achieved as a result of the Merger or that our and Albertsons' businesses will be successfully integrated in a timely manner.\nIntegration Costs We expect to incur a number of costs associated with completing the acquisition and integrating the operations of Albertsons and the Company to achieve expected synergies. The substantial majority of these costs will be non-recurring expenses resulting from the Merger and will consist of transaction costs related to the acquisition and related financing, Albertsons' transition to our IT systems, consolidation costs and employment-related costs. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our business and Albertsons'. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, may offset incremental transaction and Merger-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.\nSAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNew Business Initiatives and Strategies The introduction, implementation, success and timing of new business initiatives and strategies, including but not limited to, initiatives to increase revenue or enter into new areas of business may be less successful or may be different than anticipated, which could adversely affect our business.\nStrategic Initiatives We are exploring alternatives to monetize our investment in Casa Ley. There can be no assurance that we will be able to sell our interest in Casa Ley. In the event that the interest in Casa Ley is not sold prior to January 30, 2018, holders of the Casa Ley CVRs will be entitled to receive their pro rata portion of the fair market value of our interest minus certain fees, expenses and assumed taxes (based on a 39.25% rate) that would have been deducted from the proceeds of a sale of the Casa Ley interest.\nPension and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans We maintain defined benefit retirement plans for substantially all employees not participating in multiemployer pension plans. The funded status of these plans (the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation) is a significant factor in determining annual pension expense and cash contributions to fund the plans. The decline in the financial markets during 2008 resulted in a substantial reduction in the fair value of the retirement plan assets. As a result, cash contributions to U.S. pension and post-retirement plans increased from $7.1 million in 2010 to $151.2 million in 2011. In recent years, cash contributions have declined due to improved market conditions and the impact of the Pension Funding Stabilization legislation, which increased the discount rate used to determine pension funding. However, in 2015, in connection with the Merger closing, Safeway contributed $260 million to its largest pension plan. If financial markets do not continue to improve or if financial markets decline, increased pension expense and cash contributions may have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nIn addition, we participate in various multiemployer pension plans for substantially all employees represented by unions. We are required to make contributions to these plans in amounts established under collective bargaining agreements. Under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (\u201cPPA\u201d), contributions in addition to those made pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement may be required in limited circumstances in the form of a surcharge that is equal to 5% of the contributions due in the first year and 10% each year thereafter until the applicable bargaining agreement expires. If surcharges are required, many of our bargaining agreements provide for an offset against contribution amounts otherwise required under those agreements.\nPension expense for multiemployer pension plans is recognized as contributions are made. Benefits generally are based on a fixed amount for each year of service. We contributed $277.1 million, $259.2 million and $248.7 million to these plans in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, excluding Canadian operations and Dominick's. Based on the most recent information available to us, a number of these multiemployer plans are underfunded. As a result, contributions to these plans may increase. The amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multiemployer pension plans will depend upon the outcome of collective bargaining, actions taken by trustees who manage the plans, government regulations, the actual return on assets held in the plans and the potential payment of a withdrawal liability if we choose to exit a market, among other factors. Additionally, the benefit levels and related issues will continue to create collective bargaining challenges. Under current law, an employer that withdraws or partially withdraws from a multiemployer pension plan may incur withdrawal liability, which is related to the portion of the plan's underfunding, if any, that is allocable to the withdrawing employer under very complex actuarial and allocation rules. Multiemployer pension legislation passed in 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2014 will continue to apply to the funds in which we participate, which may have an impact on future pension contributions.\nDominick's multiemployer pension withdrawal liabilities In 2013, we sold or closed all stores in the Dominick\u2019s division. As previously reported, Dominick\u2019s participated in certain multiemployer pension plans on which withdrawal liabilities have been incurred due to the Dominick\u2019s closure. Generally, the Company may pay such withdrawal liabilities in installment payments. Withdrawal liabilities are generally subject to a 20-year payment cap, but may extend into perpetuity if a mass withdrawal from the plan occurs. During the fourth quarter of 2013, Safeway recorded a liability of $310.8 million, which represented the present\nSAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nvalue of estimated installment payments to be made to the plans based on the best information available at the time, without having yet received demand letters from the multiemployer pension plans. In April 2014 and September 2014, the Company received demand letters from three of the plans. These demand letters called for installment payments greater than Safeway\u2019s original actuarial estimate based on calculations Safeway disputes. The Company has requested a review by the plans' trustees of the demands made by the three plans. As a result of the demand letters and changes to interest rates, during 2014, the Company increased the liability to $474.4 million. Pending receipt of final demand letters or arbitration decision, any negotiated lump sum settlements or changes in the discount rate, the final amount of the withdrawal liability may be greater than or less than the amount recorded and this difference could be significant.\nSubstantial Indebtedness We currently have, and expect to continue to have, a significant amount of debt, which could adversely affect our financial health. As of January 3, 2015, we had approximately $3.0 billion in total consolidated debt outstanding, including capital lease obligations. We incurred substantial additional indebtedness in connection with the consummation of the Merger. See Note V to the consolidated financial statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report. This substantial indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. If debt markets do not permit us to refinance certain maturing debt: (i) we may be required to dedicate an unplanned portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development efforts and other general corporate purposes; (ii) our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business may be limited; (iii) we might be placed at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that have less debt; and (iv) we may be limited by the financial and other restrictive covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness. Changes in our credit ratings may have an adverse impact on our financing costs and structure in future periods, such as higher interest costs on future financings. Additionally, interest expense could be materially and adversely affected by increases in interest rates, increases in the amount of outstanding debt, decisions to incur premiums on the early redemption of debt and any other factor that results in an increase in debt.\nRisk in Providing Pharmacy Services Pharmacies such as those operated in some of our stores are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging, distribution and disposal of pharmaceuticals and other health-care products, such as risks of liability for products which cause harm to consumers, as well as increased regulatory costs. Although we maintain insurance, we cannot guarantee that the coverage limits under our insurance programs will be adequate to protect us against future claims, or that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future, or at all. Our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows may be materially adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable, or there is an increase in the liability for which we self-insure, or we suffer harm to our reputation as a result of an error or omission.\nEach of our in-store pharmacies must be licensed by the state government. The licensing requirements vary from state to state. An additional registration certificate must be granted by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d), and, in some states, a separate controlled substance license must be obtained to dispense Class II drugs. In addition, pharmacies selling Class II drugs are required to maintain extensive records and often report information to state agencies. If we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, we could suffer substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the loss of our licenses to operate pharmacies and our ability to participate in federal and state health-care programs. As a consequence of the severe penalties we could face, we must devote significant operational and managerial resources to complying with these laws and regulations. We have received subpoenas from the DEA concerning our record keeping, reporting and related practices associated with the loss or theft of controlled substances. We are cooperating with the DEA on these matters. Different interpretations and enforcement policies of these laws and regulations could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality, or could require us to make significant changes to our operations. In addition, we cannot predict the impact of future legislation and regulatory changes on our pharmacy business or assure that we will be able to obtain or maintain the regulatory approvals required to operate our business.\nSAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nUnfavorable Changes in Government Regulation Our stores are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and administrative practices that affect our business. We must comply with numerous provisions regulating health and sanitation standards, food labeling, energy, equal employment opportunity, minimum wages and licensing for the sale of food, drugs and alcoholic beverages. We cannot predict either the nature of future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, or the effect either additional government regulations or administrative orders, when and if promulgated, or disparate federal, state, local and foreign regulatory schemes would have on our future business. They could, however, require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, the recall or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated, additional record keeping, expanded documentation of the properties of certain products, expanded or different labeling and/or scientific substantiation. Any or all of such requirements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nLegal Proceedings From time to time, we are a party to legal proceedings, including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, antitrust claims, intellectual property claims and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, there is an increasing number of cases being filed against companies generally, which contain class-action allegations under federal and state wage and hour laws. We estimate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish reserves for the estimated liabilities. Assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties. Although not currently anticipated by management, unexpected outcomes in these legal proceedings, or changes in management\u2019s evaluations or predictions, could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nInformation Technology Risks We have large, complex information technology systems that are important to the successful operation of our business operations and marketing initiatives. If we were to experience difficulties accessing data stored in these systems, or in maintaining, expanding or upgrading existing systems or implementing new systems, we could incur significant losses due to disruptions in our systems and business.\nAdditionally, we gather and retain personal information that customers provide to us. We also receive and store personal information in connection with our human resources organization. Despite our considerable efforts to secure our computer network, security could be compromised, confidential information could be misappropriated or system disruptions could occur. This could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers and employees and lead to claims against us.\nAs a merchant who accepts debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (\u201cPCI DSS\u201d), issued by the PCI Council. PCI DSS contains compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. By accepting debit cards for payment, we are also subject to compliance with American National Standards Institute data encryption standards, and payment network security operating guidelines. We currently comply with PCI DSS version 2.0. Despite our compliance with these standards and other information security measures, we cannot be certain that all of our IT systems are able to prevent, contain or detect any cyber-attacks or security breaches from known malware or malware that may be developed in the future. To the extent that any disruption results in the loss, damage or misappropriation of information, we may be adversely affected by claims from customers, financial institutions, regulatory authorities, payment card associations and others. In addition, we are required to comply with the new PCI DSS version 3.0 for our 2015 assessment, and the cost of complying with stricter privacy and information security laws and standards, including PCI DSS version 3.0, could be significant to us.\nInsurance Plan Claims We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liabilities for workers\u2019 compensation, automobile and general liability, property risk (including earthquake coverage), director and officers\u2019 liability, employment practices liability, cyber risks, terrorism and employee health care benefits. We estimate the liabilities associated with the risks retained by us, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic and severity factors and other actuarial assumptions which, by their nature, are subject to a high degree of variability. Among the causes of this variability are unpredictable\nSAFEWAY INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nexternal factors affecting future inflation rates, discount rates, litigation trends, legal interpretations, benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns.\nThe majority of our workers\u2019 compensation liability is from claims occurring in California. California workers\u2019 compensation has received intense scrutiny from the state\u2019s politicians, insurers, employers and providers, as well as the public in general. Recent years have seen escalation in the number of legislative reforms, judicial rulings and social phenomena affecting our business. Some of the many sources of uncertainty in our reserve estimates include changes in benefit levels, medical fee schedules, medical utilization guidelines and apportionment. Reversals of reforms by legislation or judicial action could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets Our long-lived assets, primarily stores, are subject to periodic testing for impairment. Failure to achieve sufficient levels of cash flow at reporting units could result in impairment charges on long-lived assets. We have incurred significant impairment charges to earnings in the past, including in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012.\nEnergy and Fuel Safeway\u2019s operations are dependent upon the availability of a significant amount of energy and fuel to manufacture, store and transport products. Energy and fuel costs have experienced volatility over time. To reduce the impact of volatile energy costs, the Company has entered into contracts to purchase electricity and natural gas at fixed prices to satisfy a portion of its energy needs. This is discussed further in Part II, Item 7A of this report under the caption \u201cCommodity Price Risk.\u201d\nSafeway also sells fuel. Significant increases in wholesale fuel costs could result in retail price increases and in lower gross profit on fuel sales. Additionally, consumer demand for fuel may decline if retail prices increase. Such volatility and the impact to our operations and financial results are difficult to predict with certainty.", "PERMNO": 76149, "SIC": 5411, "TIC": "SWY"}
