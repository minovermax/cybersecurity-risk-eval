{"cik": "1618673", "company": "Performance Food Group Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-08-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global markets, the restaurant industry, and our business specifically has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Governmental authorities around the world have implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, shutdowns and social distancing requirements. These measures have adversely affected, and continue to adversely affect, workforces, suppliers, customers, consumer sentiment, economies, and financial markets, and, along with decreased consumer spending, have resulted in an economic downturn in many of our markets.\nAs an essential element of the country\u2019s food supply chain, the Company has continued to operate all of it distribution centers. Despite the Company\u2019s continued operations, mandatory and voluntary containment measures in response to COVID-19 have had a significant adverse impact on the food-away-from-home industry, along with other businesses throughout the economy, including theaters, retail operations, schools, and other businesses to whom we provide products and services, which collectively have adversely affected our results of operations.\nAt the end of fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2021, we saw the impact of COVID-19 in our operations, including significant decreases in sales. Although we believe we have taken prudent measures to maintain our financial liquidity and support our business, the impacts of COVID-19 have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on numerous aspects of our business, financial condition and results of operations including, our growth, product costs, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, logistics constraints, customer demand for our products and industry demand generally, consumer spending, our liquidity, the price of our securities and trading markets with respect thereto, and the global economy and financial markets generally. While vaccination efforts have proved successful, we cannot predict the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic or future governmental regulations or legislation that may be passed as a result of ongoing or future COVID-19 outbreaks. The continued impact of COVID-19 and the enactment of additional governmental regulations and restrictions may further adversely impact the global economy, the restaurant industry, and our business specifically, despite prior or future actions taken by the Company.\nPeriods of difficult economic conditions and heightened uncertainty in the financial markets affect consumer confidence, which can adversely affect our business.\nThe foodservice industry is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions. Deteriorating economic conditions and heightened uncertainty in the financial markets, such as those the global economy is currently facing as it recovers from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, negatively affect consumer confidence and discretionary spending. The decline in spending resulting from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic led to reductions in the frequency of dining out and the amount spent by consumers for food-away-from-home purchases. These conditions, in turn, negatively affect our results during such periods. The continuation of these or similar economic conditions in the future or permanent changes in consumers\u2019 dining habits as a result of such conditions would likely negatively affect our operating results.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers, and our business may be affected by interruption of supplies or increases in product costs.\nWe obtain substantially all of our foodservice and related products from third-party suppliers. We typically do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers. Although our purchasing volume can sometimes provide an advantage when dealing with suppliers, suppliers may not provide the foodservice products and supplies needed by us in the quantities and at the prices requested. Our suppliers may also be affected by higher costs to source or produce and transport food products, as well as by other related expenses that they pass through to their customers, which could result in higher costs for the products they supply to us. Because we do not control the actual production of most of the products we sell, we are also subject to material supply chain interruptions, delays caused by interruption in production, and increases in product costs, including those resulting from product recalls or a need to find alternate materials or suppliers, based on conditions outside our control. These conditions include labor shortages, work slowdowns, work interruptions, strikes or other job actions by employees of suppliers, weather conditions or more prolonged climate change, crop conditions, water shortages, transportation interruptions, unavailability of fuel or increases in fuel costs, competitive demands, contamination with mold, bacteria or other contaminants, and natural disasters or other catastrophic events, including, the outbreak of e. coli or similar food borne illnesses or bioterrorism in the United States. Additionally, our suppliers could be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. If our suppliers\u2019 employees are unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, limitations on travel or other government restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, or if or suppliers experience labor shortages, we could face shortages in the products we sell and our operations and sales could be adversely impacted by such future supply interruptions. Our inability to obtain adequate supplies of foodservice and related products as a result of any of the foregoing factors or otherwise could mean that we could not fulfill our obligations to our customers and, as a result, our customers may turn to other\ndistributors. Our inability to anticipate and react to changing food costs through our sourcing and purchasing practices in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe face risks relating to labor relations, labor costs, and the availability of qualified labor.\nAs of July 3, 2021, we had more than 23,000 employees of whom approximately 1,200 were members of local unions associated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters or other unions. Although our labor contract negotiations have in the past generally taken place with the local union representatives, we may be subject to increased efforts to engage us in multi-unit bargaining that could subject us to the risk of multi-location labor disputes or work stoppages that would place us at greater risk of being materially adversely affected by labor disputes. In addition, labor organizing activities could result in additional employees becoming unionized, which could result in higher labor costs. Although we have not experienced any significant labor disputes or work stoppages in recent history, and we believe we have satisfactory relationships with our employees, including those who are union members, increased unionization or a work stoppage because of our failure to renegotiate union contracts could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to a wide range of labor costs. Because our labor costs are, as a percentage of net sales, higher than in many other industries, we may be significantly harmed by labor cost increases. In addition, labor is a significant cost for many of our customers in the U.S. food-away-from-home industry. Any increase in their labor costs, including any increases in costs as a result of increases in minimum wage requirements, could reduce the profitability of our customers and reduce demand for our products.\nWe rely heavily on our employees, particularly drivers, and any shortage of qualified labor could significantly affect our business. Our recruiting and retention efforts and efforts to increase productivity may not be successful and we could encounter a shortage of qualified labor in future periods. Any such shortage would decrease our ability to serve our customers effectively. Such a shortage would also likely lead to higher wages for employees and a corresponding reduction in our profitability. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the Company\u2019s ability to hire and retain qualified labor resulting in the payment of higher temporary contract labor costs. Additionally, if our employees are unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, limitations on travel or other government restrictions in connection with COVID-19, we could face additional shortages of qualified labor and higher labor costs.\nFurther, we continue to assess our healthcare benefit costs. Despite our efforts to control costs while still providing competitive healthcare benefits to our associates, significant increases in healthcare costs continue to occur, and we can provide no assurance that our cost containment efforts in this area will be effective. Our distributors and suppliers also may be affected by higher minimum wage and benefit standards, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us. If we are unable to raise our prices or cut other costs to cover this expense, such increases in expenses could materially reduce our operating profit.\nCompetition in our industry is intense, and we may not be able to compete successfully.\nThe foodservice distribution industry is highly competitive. Certain of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. Furthermore, there are two larger broadline distributors, Sysco, and US Foods, with national footprints. In addition, there are numerous regional, local, and specialty distributors. These smaller distributors often align themselves with other smaller distributors through purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups to enhance their geographic reach, private label offerings, overall purchasing power, cost efficiencies and to assemble delivery networks for national or multi-regional distribution. We often do not have exclusive service agreements with our customers and our customers may switch to other distributors if those distributors can offer lower prices, differentiated products, or customer service that is perceived to be superior. We believe that most purchasing decisions in the foodservice business are based on the quality and price of the product and a distributor\u2019s ability to fill orders completely and accurately and provide timely deliveries. We cannot assure you that our current or potential, future competitors will not provide products or services that are comparable or superior to those provided by us or adapt more quickly than we do to evolving trends or changing market requirements. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively against current and potential, future competitors, and increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe operate in a low margin industry, which could increase the volatility of our results of operations.\nSimilar to other resale-based industries, the distribution industry is characterized by relatively low profit margins. These low profit margins tend to increase the volatility of our reported net income since any decline in our net sales or increase in our costs that is small relative to our total net sales or costs may have a large impact on our net income. For example, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers has resulted in a significant decline in organic case volume and net sales in certain of the channels we serve, and, as a result, the Company reported a lower net income for fiscal 2021 than it would have reported had there been no pandemic.\nCost inflation or deflation could affect the value of our inventory and our financial results.\nWe make a significant portion of our sales at prices that are based on the cost of products we sell plus a percentage markup. As a result, volatile food costs may have a direct impact upon our profitability. Our profit levels may be negatively affected during periods of product cost deflation, even though our gross profit percentage may remain relatively constant or even increase. Prolonged periods of product cost inflation also may have a negative impact on our profit margins and earnings to the extent such product cost increases are not passed on to customers because of their resistance to higher prices. For example, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy has resulted in inflation of 4.6% for fiscal 2021, which has had, and could continue to have, an impact our product costs and profit margins. Furthermore, our business model requires us to maintain an inventory of products, and changes in price levels between the time that we acquire inventory from our suppliers and the time we sell the inventory to our customers could lead to unexpected shifts in demand for our products or could require us to sell inventory at lesser profit or a loss. In addition, product cost inflation may negatively affect consumer discretionary spending decisions within our customers\u2019 establishments, which could impact our sales. Our inability to quickly respond to inflationary and deflationary cost pressures could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nMany of our customers are not obligated to continue purchasing products from us.\nMany of our customers buy from us pursuant to individual purchase orders, and we often do not enter into long-term agreements with these customers. Because such customers are not obligated to continue purchasing products from us, we cannot assure you that the volume and/or number of our customers\u2019 purchase orders will remain constant or increase or that we will be able to maintain our existing customer base. Significant decreases in the volume and/or number of our customers\u2019 purchase orders or our inability to retain or grow our current customer base may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. As a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers, organic case volume declined substantially for the first nine months of fiscal 2021 compared to the prior year period. As restrictions eased during the end of fiscal 2021, we experienced rapid growth which resulted in an overall increase in organic case volume of 2.7% for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020.\nGroup purchasing organizations may become more active in our industry and increase their efforts to add our customers as members of these organizations.\nSome of our customers, particularly our larger customers, purchase their products from us through group purchasing organizations (\u201cGPOs\u201d) in an effort to lower the prices paid by these customers on their foodservice orders, and we have experienced some pricing pressure from these purchasers. These GPOs have also made efforts to include smaller, independent restaurants. If these GPOs are able to add a significant number of our customers as members, we may be forced to lower the prices we charge these customers in order to retain their business, which would negatively affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Additionally, if we are unable or unwilling to lower the prices we charge for our products to a level that is satisfactory to the GPOs, we may lose the business of those customers that are members of these organizations, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations\nChanges in consumer eating habits could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nChanges in consumer eating habits (such as a decline in consuming food away from home, a decline in portion sizes, or a shift in preferences toward restaurants that are not our customers) could reduce demand for our products. Consumer eating habits could be affected by a number of factors, including changes in attitudes regarding diet and health or new information regarding the health effects of consuming certain foods. If consumer eating habits change significantly, we may be required to modify or discontinue sales of certain items in our product portfolio, and we may experience higher costs associated with the implementation of those changes. Changing consumer eating habits may reduce the frequency with which consumers purchase meals outside of the home.\nMandatory and voluntary containment measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted businesses throughout the economy, including theaters, retail operations, schools, and other businesses to whom we provide products and services, all of which has adversely affected our results of operations. Despite easing of government restrictions and a gradual reopening of the economy, it is unclear if the recent, significant decline in the food away from home industry is temporary or the beginning of a long-term transition. Additionally, changes in consumer eating habits may result in the enactment of laws and regulations that affect the ingredients and nutritional content of our food products, or laws and regulations requiring us to disclose the nutritional content of our food products. Compliance with these laws and regulations, as well as others regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of our food products, may be costly and time-consuming. Our inability to effectively respond to changes in food away from home consumer trends, consumer health perceptions or resulting new laws or regulations or to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nExtreme weather conditions and natural disasters may interrupt our business or our customers\u2019 businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nMany of our facilities and our customers\u2019 facilities are located in areas that may be subject to extreme and occasionally prolonged weather conditions, including hurricanes, blizzards, earthquakes, and extreme heat or cold. Such extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations and reduce the number of consumers who visit our customers\u2019 facilities in such areas. Furthermore, such extreme weather conditions may interrupt or impede access to our customers\u2019 facilities, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nFluctuations in fuel costs and other transportation costs could harm our business.\nThe high cost of fuel can negatively affect consumer confidence and discretionary spending and, as a result, reduce the frequency and amount spent by consumers within our customers\u2019 establishments for food away from home. The high cost of fuel and other transportation related costs, such as tolls, fuel taxes, and license and registration fees, can also increase the price we pay for products as well as the costs incurred by us to deliver products to our customers. Furthermore, both the price and supply of fuel are unpredictable and fluctuate based on events outside our control, including geopolitical developments, supply and demand for oil and gas, actions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil and gas producers, war and unrest in oil producing countries and regions, regional production patterns, and environmental concerns. These factors, if occurring over an extended period of time, could have a material adverse effect on our sales, margins, operating expenses, or results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we may enter into arrangements to manage our exposure to fuel costs. Such arrangements, however, may not be effective and may result in us paying higher than market costs for a portion of our fuel. In addition, while we have been successful in the past in implementing fuel surcharges to offset fuel cost increases, we may not be able to do so in the future.\nIn addition, compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations relating to carbon emissions and the effects of global warming can be expected to have a significant impact on our transportation costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIf one or more of our competitors implements a lower cost structure, they may be able to offer lower prices to customers and we may be unable to adjust our cost structure in order to compete profitably.\nOver the last several decades, the retail food industry has undergone significant change as companies such as Wal-Mart and Costco have developed a lower cost structure to provide their customer base with an everyday low-cost product offering. As a large-scale foodservice distributor, we have similar strategies to remain competitive in the marketplace by reducing our cost structure. However, if one or more of our competitors in the foodservice distribution industry adopted an everyday low-price strategy, we would potentially be pressured to lower prices to our customers and would need to achieve additional cost savings to offset these reductions. We may be unable to change our cost structure and pricing practices rapidly enough to successfully compete in such an environment.\nIf we fail to increase our sales in the highest margin portions of our business, our profitability may suffer.\nDistribution is a relatively low margin industry. The most profitable customers within the distribution industry are generally independent customers. In addition, our most profitable products are our Performance Brands. We typically provide a higher level of services to our independent customers and are able to earn a higher operating margin on sales to independent customers. Independent customers are also more likely to purchase our Performance Brands. Our ability to continue to penetrate this key customer type is critical to achieving increased operating profits. Changes in the buying practices of independent customers or decreases in our sales to independent customers or a decrease in the sales of our Performance Brands could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nChanges in pricing practices of our suppliers could negatively affect our profitability.\nDistributors have traditionally generated a significant percentage of their gross margins from promotional allowances paid by their suppliers. Promotional allowances are payments from suppliers based upon the efficiencies that the distributor provides to its suppliers through purchasing scale and through marketing and merchandising expertise. Promotional allowances are a standard practice among suppliers to distributors and represent a significant source of profitability for us and our competitors. Any change in such practices that results in the reduction or elimination of promotional allowances could be disruptive to us and the industry as a whole and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur growth strategy may not achieve the anticipated results.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to grow our business, including through increasing our independent sales, expanding our Performance Brands, making strategic acquisitions, including the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition, and achieving improved operating efficiencies as we continue to expand and diversify our customer base. Our growth and innovation strategies require significant commitments of management resources and capital investments and may not grow our net sales at the rate we expect or at all. As a result, we may not be able to recover the costs incurred in developing our new projects and initiatives or to realize their intended or projected benefits, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operation.\nWe may not be able to realize benefits of acquisitions or successfully integrate the businesses we acquire.\nFrom time to time, we acquire businesses that broaden our customer base, and/or increase our capabilities and geographic reach. If we are unable to integrate acquired businesses successfully or to realize anticipated economic, operational, and other benefits and synergies in a timely manner, our profitability could be adversely affected. Integration of an acquired business may be more difficult when we acquire a business in a market in which we have limited expertise or with a company culture different from ours. A significant expansion of our business and operations, in terms of geography or magnitude, could strain our administrative and operational resources. Additionally, we may be unable to retain qualified management and other key personnel employed by acquired companies and may fail to build a network of acquired companies in new markets. We could face significantly greater competition from broadline foodservice distributors in these markets than we face in our existing markets.\nWe also regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire other companies. To the extent our future growth includes acquisitions, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any necessary financing for such acquisitions, consummate such potential acquisitions effectively, effectively and efficiently integrate any acquired entities, or successfully expand into new markets.\nOur earnings may be reduced by amortization charges associated with any future acquisitions.\nAfter we complete an acquisition, we must amortize any identifiable intangible assets associated with the acquired company over future periods. We also must amortize any identifiable intangible assets that we acquire directly. Our amortization of these amounts reduces our future earnings in the affected periods.\nOur business is subject to significant governmental regulation, and costs or claims related to these requirements could adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are subject to regulation by state and local health departments, the USDA, and the FDA, which generally impose standards for product quality and sanitation and are responsible for the administration of recent bioterrorism legislation affecting the foodservice industry. These government authorities regulate, among other things, the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, and labeling of our products. The FSMA requires that the FDA impose comprehensive, prevention-based controls across the food supply, further regulates food products imported into the United States, and provides the FDA with mandatory recall authority. Our seafood operations are also specifically regulated by federal and state laws, including those administered by the National Marine Fisheries Service, established for the preservation of certain species of marine life, including fish and shellfish. Our processing and distribution facilities must be registered with the FDA biennially and are subject to periodic government agency inspections. State and/or federal authorities generally inspect our facilities at least annually. The Federal Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, which specifies standards for the sale, shipment, inspection, and rejection of agricultural products, governs our relationships with our fresh food suppliers with respect to the grading and commercial acceptance of product shipments. We are also subject to regulation by state authorities for the accuracy of our weighing and measuring devices. Additionally, the Surface Transportation Board and the Federal Highway Administration regulate our trucking operations, and interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the U.S. Department of Transportation and other relevant federal and state agencies. Our suppliers are also subject to similar regulatory requirements and oversight. We have expanded the product lines of our Vistar segment to include hemp-based CBD products authorized under the 2018 Farm Bill. Sales of certain hemp-based CBD products are prohibited in some jurisdictions and the FDA and certain states and local governments may enact regulations that limit the marketing and use of such products. In the event that the FDA or state and local governments impose regulations on CBD products, we do not know what the impact would be on our products, and what costs, requirements, and possible prohibitions may be associated with such regulations. The failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, administrative, civil, or criminal penalties or fines; mandatory or voluntary product recalls; warning or untitled letters; cease and desist orders against operations that are not in compliance; closure of facilities or operations; the loss, revocation, or modification of any existing licenses, permits, registrations, or approvals; or the failure to obtain additional licenses, permits, registrations, or approvals in new jurisdictions where we intend to do business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations. These laws and regulations may change in the future and we may incur material costs in our efforts to comply with current or future laws and regulations or in any required product recalls.\nIn addition, our operations are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations in many areas of our business, such as, minimum wage, overtime, wage payment, wage and hour and employment discrimination, immigration, human health and safety and relating to the protection of the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air, soil, and water; the management and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes; employee exposure to hazards in the workplace; and the investigation and remediation of contamination resulting from releases of petroleum products and other regulated materials. In the course of our operations, we operate, maintain, and fuel fleet vehicles; store fuel in on-site above and underground storage tanks; operate refrigeration systems; and use and dispose of hazardous substances and food wastes. We could incur substantial costs, including fines or penalties and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, as a result of any violations of environmental or workplace safety laws and regulations or releases of regulated materials into the environment. In addition, we could incur investigation, remediation, or other costs related to environmental conditions at our currently or formerly owned or operated properties. Additionally, concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Increased regulation regarding greenhouse gas emissions, especially diesel engine emissions, could impose substantial costs upon us. These costs include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase, and capital costs associated with updating or replacing our vehicles prematurely.\nFinally, following our acquisition of Eby-Brown Company LLC (\u201cEby-Brown\u201d), a distributor of pre-packaged candy, snacks, specialty beverages and tobacco products in the convenience industry, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we became subject to legislation, regulation and other matters regarding the marketing, distribution, sale, taxation and use of cigarette, tobacco and alternative nicotine products. For example, various jurisdictions have adopted or are considering legislation and regulations restricting displays and marketing of tobacco and alternative nicotine products, requiring the disclosure of ingredients used in the manufacture of tobacco and alternative nicotine products, and imposing restrictions on public smoking and vaping. In addition, the FDA has been empowered to regulate changes to nicotine yields and the chemicals and flavors used in tobacco and alternative nicotine products (including cigars, pipe and e-cigarette products), require ingredient listings be displayed on tobacco and alternative nicotine products, prohibit the use of certain terms which may attract youth or mislead users as to the risks involved with using tobacco and alternative nicotine products, as well as limit or otherwise impact the marketing of tobacco and alternative nicotine products by requiring additional labels or warnings that must be pre-approved by the FDA. Such legislation and related regulation are likely to continue to adversely impact the market for tobacco and alternative nicotine products and, accordingly, our sales of such products. Likewise, cigarettes and tobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes. Significant increases in cigarette-related taxes and/or fees have been proposed or enacted and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted by various taxing jurisdictions within the U.S. These tax increases negatively impact consumption and may cause a shift in sales from premium brands to discount brands, illicit channels, or tobacco alternatives, such as electronic cigarettes, as smokers seek lower priced options. Furthermore, taxing jurisdictions have the ability to change or rescind credit terms currently extended for the remittance of taxes that we collect on their behalf. If these excise taxes are substantially increased, or credit terms are substantially reduced, it could have a negative impact on our liquidity.\nA portion of our sales volume is dependent upon the distribution of cigarettes and other tobacco products, sales of which are generally declining.\nFollowing the acquisition of Eby-Brown, a significant portion of our sales volume depends upon the distribution of cigarettes and other tobacco products. Due to increases in the prices of cigarettes, restrictions on cigarette manufacturers\u2019 marketing and promotions, increases in cigarette regulation and excise taxes, health concerns, increased pressure from anti-tobacco groups, the rise in popularity of tobacco alternatives, including electronic cigarettes, other alternative nicotine products, and other factors, cigarette consumption in the United States has been declining gradually over the past few decades. In many instances, tobacco alternatives, such as electronic cigarettes, are not subject to federal, state, and local excise taxes like the sale of conventional cigarettes or other tobacco products. We expect consumption trends of legal cigarette products will continue to be negatively impacted by the factors described above. If we are unable to sell other products to make up for these declines in cigarette sales, our operating results may suffer.\nIf the products we distribute are alleged to cause injury or illness or fail to comply with governmental regulations, we may need to recall our products and may experience product liability claims.\nThe products we distribute may be subject to product recalls, including voluntary recalls or withdrawals, if they are alleged to cause injury or illness or if they are alleged to have been mislabeled, misbranded, or adulterated or to otherwise be in violation of governmental regulations. We may also voluntarily recall or withdraw products that we consider not to meet our quality standards, whether for taste, appearance, or otherwise, in order to protect our brand and reputation. If there is any future product withdrawal that results in substantial and unexpected expenditures, destruction of product inventory, damage to our reputation, and lost sales because of the unavailability of the product for a period of time, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe also may be subject to product liability claims if the consumption or use of our products is alleged to cause injury or illness. While we carry product liability insurance, our insurance may not be adequate to cover all liabilities we may incur in connection with product liability claims. For example, punitive damages may not be covered by insurance. In addition, we may not be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance, to obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all, or to secure additional coverage, which may result in future product liability claims being uninsured. If there is a product liability judgment against us or a settlement agreement related to a product liability claim, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to or affected by product liability claims relating to products we distribute.\nWe, like any other seller of food, may be exposed to product liability claims in the event that the use of products we sell causes injury or illness. While we believe we have sufficient primary and excess umbrella liability insurance with respect to product liability claims we cannot assure you that our limits are sufficient to cover all our liabilities or that we will be able to obtain replacement insurance on comparable terms, and any replacement insurance or our current insurance may not continue to be available at a reasonable cost, or, if available, may not be adequate to cover all of our liabilities. We generally seek contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from parties supplying products to us, but this indemnification or insurance coverage is limited, as a practical matter, to the creditworthiness of the indemnifying party and the insured limits of any insurance provided by suppliers. If we do not have adequate insurance or contractual indemnification available, product liability relating to defective products could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe rely heavily on technology in our business and any technology disruption or delay in implementing new technology could adversely affect our business.\nThe foodservice distribution industry is transaction intensive. Our ability to control costs and to maximize profits, as well as to serve customers effectively, depends on the reliability of our information technology systems and related data entry processes. We rely on software and other technology systems, some of which are managed by third-party service providers, to manage significant aspects of our business, including making purchases, processing orders, managing our warehouses, loading trucks in the most efficient manner, and optimizing the use of storage space. The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer. In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, power outages, systems failures, security breaches, cyber-attacks, and viruses. While we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiatives and disaster recovery plans, these measures cannot fully insulate us from technology disruption that could result in adverse effects on our operations and profits.\nInformation technology systems evolve rapidly and in order to compete effectively we are required to integrate new technologies in a timely and cost-effective manner. If competitors implement new technologies before we do, allowing such competitors to provide lower priced or enhanced services of superior quality compared to those we provide, this could have an adverse effect on our operations and profits.\nA cyber security incident or other technology disruptions could negatively affect our business and our relationships with customers.\nWe rely upon information technology networks and systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information, and to manage or support virtually all of our business processes and activities. We also use mobile devices, social networking, and other online activities to connect with our employees, suppliers, business partners, and customers. These uses give rise to cybersecurity risks, including security breach, espionage, system disruption, theft, and inadvertent release of information. Our business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including customers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 personal information, private information about employees, and financial and strategic information about us and our business partners. We have implemented measures to prevent security breaches and other cyber incidents, and, to date, interruption of our information technology networks, and systems have been infrequent and have not had a material impact on our operations. However, because cyber-attacks are increasingly sophisticated and more frequent, our preventative measures and incident response efforts may not be entirely effective. Additionally, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a substantial portion of our corporate employees are working remotely using smartphones, tablets, and other wireless devices, which may further heighten these and other operational risks. The theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property, or interference with our information technology systems or the technology systems of third parties on which we rely could result in business disruption, negative publicity, brand damage, violation of privacy laws, loss of customers, potential liability, and competitive disadvantage.\nAdverse judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved in the normal course of our business could reduce our profits or limit our ability to operate our business.\nIn the normal course of our business, we are involved in various legal proceedings. The outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted. If any of these proceedings were to be determined adversely to us or a settlement involving a payment of a material sum of money were to occur, it could materially and adversely affect our profits or ability to operate our business. Additionally, we could become the subject of future claims by third parties, including our employees; suppliers, customers, and other counterparties; our investors; or regulators. Any significant adverse judgments or settlements would reduce our profits and could limit our ability to operate our business. Further, we may incur costs related to claims for which we have appropriate third-party indemnity, but such third parties may fail to fulfill their contractual obligations.\nAdverse publicity about us, lack of confidence in our products or services, and other risks could negatively affect our reputation and affect our business.\nMaintaining a good reputation and public confidence in the safety of the products we distribute or services we provide is critical to our business, particularly to selling our Performance Brands products. Anything that damages our reputation, or the public\u2019s confidence in our products, services, facilities, delivery fleet, operations, or employees, whether or not justified, including adverse publicity about the quality, safety, or integrity of our products, could quickly affect our net sales and profits. Reports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses or harmful bacteria (such as e. coli, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, hepatitis A, trichinosis, listeria, or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering could also severely injure our reputation or negatively affect the public\u2019s confidence in our products. We may need to recall our products if they become adulterated. If patrons of our restaurant customers become ill from food-borne illnesses, our customers could be forced to temporarily close restaurant locations and our sales would be correspondingly decreased. In addition, instances of food-borne illnesses, food tampering, or other health concerns, such as flu epidemics or other pandemics (including COVID-19), even those unrelated to the use of our products, or public concern regarding the safety of our products, can result in negative publicity about the foodservice distribution industry and cause our sales to decrease dramatically. In addition, a widespread health epidemic (such as COVID-19) or food-borne illness, whether or not related to the use of our products, as well as terrorist events may cause consumers to avoid public gathering places, like restaurants, or otherwise change their eating behaviors. Health concerns and negative publicity may harm our results of operations and damage the reputation of, or result in a lack of acceptance of, our products or the brands that we carry or the services that we provide.\nWe have experienced losses because of the inability to collect accounts receivable in the past and could experience increases in such losses in the future if our customers are unable to pay their debts to us when due.\nCertain of our customers have from time to time experienced bankruptcy, insolvency, and/or an inability to pay their debts to us as they come due. If our customers suffer significant financial difficulty, they may be unable to pay their debts to us timely or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. It is possible that customers may contest their contractual obligations to us under bankruptcy laws or otherwise. Significant customer bankruptcies could further adversely affect our net sales and increase our operating expenses by requiring larger provisions for bad debt expense. In addition, even when our contracts with these customers are not contested, if customers are unable to meet their obligations on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our ability to collect receivables. Further, we may have to negotiate significant discounts and/or extended financing terms with these customers in such a situation. If we are unable to collect upon our accounts receivable as they come due in an efficient and timely manner, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nInsurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our profitability.\nOur future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historic levels, which could reduce our profitability. We maintain high-deductible insurance programs covering portions of general and vehicle liability and workers\u2019 compensation. The amount in excess of the deductibles is insured by third-party insurance carriers, subject to certain limitations and exclusions. We also maintain self-funded group medical insurance.\nWe reserve for anticipated losses and expenses and periodically evaluate and adjust our claims reserves to reflect our experience. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts.\nAlthough we believe our aggregate insurance limits should be sufficient to cover reasonably expected claims costs, it is possible that the amount of one or more claims could exceed our aggregate coverage limits. Insurance carriers have raised premiums for many businesses in our industry, including ours, and our insurance and claims expense could continue to increase in the future. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if (1) total claims costs significantly exceed our coverage limits, (2) we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, (3) our insurance carriers fail to pay on our insurance claims, (4) we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided or (5) a large number of claims may cause our cost under our deductibles to differ from historic averages.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition\nThe Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition is subject to conditions, some or all of which may not be satisfied, or completed on a timely basis. Failure to complete the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition could have material and adverse effects on us.\nThe completion of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition remains subject to a number of conditions, including, the adoption of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 17, 2021 (the \u201cmerger agreement\u201d), by the Core-Mark stockholders, which make the completion of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition and timing thereof uncertain. Also, either Core-Mark or we may terminate the merger agreement if the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition has not been consummated by February 17, 2022 (subject to an automatic extension to May 17, 2022, in certain circumstances), except that this right to terminate the merger agreement will not be available to any party whose failure to perform any obligation under the merger agreement has been the cause of, or the primary factor that resulted in, the failure of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition to be consummated on or before that date.\nIf the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition is not completed, our ongoing businesses may be materially and adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition, we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe market price of our common stock could decline;\n\u2022\nwe could owe substantial termination fees to Core-Mark under certain circumstances (as defined in the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition purchase agreement);\n\u2022\nif the merger agreement is terminated and our Board or the Core-Mark Board seeks another business combination, our stockholders cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to enter into a transaction on terms equivalent to or more attractive than the terms that Core-Mark has agreed to in the merger agreement;\n\u2022\nwe will be required to pay the costs relating to the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory and printing fees, whether or not the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition is completed; and\n\u2022\nwe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or from our customers or employees.\nIn addition, if the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition is not completed, we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition or related to any proceeding commenced against us to perform our obligations under the merger agreement. The materialization of any of these risks could adversely impact our ongoing businesses.\nSimilarly, delays in the completion of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition could, among other things, result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other negative effects associated with uncertainty about completion of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition.\nThe consummation of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition was subject to the expiration of the waiting period applicable thereto under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The waiting period expired effective as of 11:59 p.m. EST on August 9, 2021, and accordingly, the applicable closing condition to the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition has been satisfied. On August 3, 2021, the FTC's Bureau of Competition of the Federal Trade Commission (the \u201cFTC\u201d) announced that it was facing a substantial increase in merger filings that is straining the agency\u2019s capacity to rigorously investigate deals within the HSR Act timelines, and therefore, the FTC would start issuing standard letters on deals where the agency did not have time to fully investigate. Consistent with this guidance from the FTC, PFG and Core-Mark received such a standard form letter on August 9, 2021, which states, among other things, that, although the waiting period would be expiring, the FTC\u2019s investigation of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition remains open and ongoing. The letter states that the FTC may challenge transactions-before or after their consummation. The FTC had such ability prior to and independent of its announcement on August 3, 2021, that it would start issuing the standard letters described above. Accordingly, PFG believes that the letters they received do not change or expand the FTC\u2019s ability under U.S. law to investigate and challenge the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition after expiration of the HSR Act waiting period and after consummation of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition.\nWe are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition is pending, which could adversely affect the business and operations of the combined company.\nIn connection with the pendency of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition, it is possible that some customers, suppliers and other persons with whom we have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us, as the case may be, as a result of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition, which could negatively affect our current or future revenues, earnings and cash flows, as well as the market price of our common stock, regardless of whether the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition is completed.\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, the Company is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to completing the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition, which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies,\nincluding the ability in certain cases to enter into or amend contracts, acquire or dispose of assets, incur indebtedness or incur capital expenditures. Such limitations could adversely affect our businesses and operations prior to the completion of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition.\nEach of the risks described above may be exacerbated by delays or other adverse developments with respect to the completion of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition.\nUncertainties associated with the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees, and we may have difficulty attracting and motivating management personnel and other key employees, which could adversely affect our future business and operations.\nWe are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of management personnel and other key employees to execute our business plan. Our success after the completion of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition will depend in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain key management personnel and other key employees. Prior to completion of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition, current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their roles within the Company following the completion of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to attract, motivate or retain management personnel and other key employees. In addition, no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract, motivate or retain management personnel and other key employees to the same extent after the completion Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition.\nWe may be targets of securities class action and derivative lawsuits that could result in substantial costs and may delay or prevent Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition from being completed.\nSecurities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have entered into merger agreements. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s time and resources. An adverse judgment could result in monetary damages, which could have a negative impact on our and Core-Mark\u2019s respective liquidity and financial condition. Additionally, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition, then that injunction may delay or prevent the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition from being completed, or from being completed within the expected timeframe, which may adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operation.\nCompletion of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition may trigger change in control or other provisions in certain agreements to which Core-Mark or its subsidiaries are a party, which may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nThe completion of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition may trigger change in control and other provisions in certain agreements to which Core-Mark or its subsidiaries are a party. If the Company and Core-Mark are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages. Even if the Company and Core-Mark are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to Core-Mark or the combined company. Any of the foregoing or similar developments may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nAfter the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition, we may be unable to successfully integrate the businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition.\nThe combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. The success of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to successfully combine Core-Mark, which currently operates as an independent public company, with our business and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies, from the combination. If we are unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of our common stock may be harmed. Additionally, as a result of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition, rating agencies may take negative actions against our credit ratings, which may increase our financing costs, including in connection with the financing of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition.\nThe Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition involves the integration of Core-Mark with our existing business, which is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. We have not previously completed a transaction comparable in size or scope to the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition. The integration of Core-Mark into our business may result in material challenges, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from ongoing business concerns and performance shortfalls as a result of the devotion of management\u2019s attention to the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition;\n\u2022\nmanaging a larger company;\n\u2022\nmaintaining employee morale and attracting and motivating and retaining management personnel and other key employees;\n\u2022\nthe possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding the integration process;\n\u2022\nretaining existing business and operational relationships and attracting new business and operational relationships;\n\u2022\nconsolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations;\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically separate organizations;\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in federal or state laws or regulations; and\n\u2022\nunforeseen expenses or delays associated with the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition.\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in delays, increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe and Core-Mark have operated, and until completion of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition will continue to operate, independently. We and Core-Mark are currently permitted to conduct only limited planning for the integration of the two companies following the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition and have not yet determined the exact nature of how the businesses and operations of the two companies will be combined after the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition. The actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized.\nThe Company\u2019s stockholders will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the completion of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition and will exercise less influence over the policies of the combined company than they now have on the policies of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s stockholders presently have the right to vote in the election of the PFG board of directors and on other matters affecting the Company. Immediately after the completion of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition, it is expected that current PFG stockholders will own approximately 87% of our outstanding common stock outstanding and current Core-Mark stockholders will own approximately 13% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, current PFG stockholders and have less influence on the policies of the combined company than they now have on the policies of PFG.\nOur future results may be adversely impacted if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the completion of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition.\nFollowing the completion of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition, the size of our business will be significantly larger than it is currently. Our ability to successfully manage this expanded business will depend, in part, upon management\u2019s ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address not only the integration of two independent stand-alone companies, but also the increased scale and scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings and other benefits currently anticipated from the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses related to the completion of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition and our integration of Core-Mark.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the completion of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition and the integration of Core-Mark\u2019s business. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, payroll, pricing, revenue management, marketing and benefits. In addition, our and Core-Mark\u2019s businesses will continue to maintain a presence in Richmond, Virginia and Westlake, Texas, respectively. The substantial majority of these costs will be non-recurring expenses related to the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition (including financing of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition), facilities and systems consolidation costs. We may incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to attract, motivate or retain management personnel and other key employees. We and Core-Mark will also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans for the combined business, and the\nexecution of these plans may lead to additional unanticipated costs. Additionally, as a result of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition, rating agencies may take negative actions with regard to our credit ratings, which may increase our financing costs, including in connection with the financing of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition. These incremental transaction and merger-related costs may exceed the savings the Company expects to achieve after the consummation of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition from the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, particularly in the near term and in the event there are material unanticipated costs.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may decline as a result of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition.\nThe market price of PFG common stock may decline as a result of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition, and holders of PFG common stock could lose the value of their investment in PFG common stock, if, among other things, we are unable to achieve the expected growth in earnings, or if the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies, from the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition are not realized, or if the transaction costs related to the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition are greater than expected, or if the financing related to the transaction is on unfavorable terms. The market price also may decline if we do not achieve the perceived benefits of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts or if the effect of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts. The issuance of shares of PFG common stock in the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition could on its own have the effect of depressing the market price for PFG common stock. In addition, many Core-Mark stockholders may decide not to hold the shares of PFG common stock they receive as a result of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition. Other Core-Mark stockholders, such as funds with limitations on their permitted holdings of stock in individual issuers, may be required to sell the shares of PFG common stock they receive as a result of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition. Any such sales of PFG common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for PFG common stock. Moreover, general fluctuations in stock markets could have a material adverse effect on the market for, or liquidity of, the PFG common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nWe may not have discovered undisclosed liabilities of Core-Mark during our due diligence process.\nIn the course of the due diligence review of Core-Mark that we conducted prior to the execution of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition, we may not have discovered, or may have been unable to quantify, undisclosed liabilities of Core-Mark and its subsidiaries. Examples of such undisclosed liabilities may include, but are not limited to, pending or threatened litigation or regulatory matters. Any such undisclosed liabilities could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows following the completion of the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or in our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt, and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.\nAs of July 3, 2021, we had $2,544.2 million of indebtedness, including finance lease obligations. In addition, we had $2,252.0 million of availability under the ABL Facility after giving effect to $161.7 million of outstanding letters of credit and $55.1 million of lenders\u2019 reserves under the ABL Facility. In connection with the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition, we expect to incur approximately $1,440 million in additional indebtedness.\nOur high degree of leverage could have important consequences for us, including:\n\u2022\nrequiring us to utilize a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development activity, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry, or competitive developments;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates to the extent our borrowings are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the agreements governing our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting.\nA substantial portion of our indebtedness is floating rate debt. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on such indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. In addition, interest on the ABL Facility is calculated based on LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d) announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In the meantime, actions by the FCA, other regulators, or law enforcement agencies may result in changes to the method by which LIBOR is calculated. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes or any other reforms to LIBOR that may be enacted in the U.K. or elsewhere.\nWe may elect to enter into interest rate swaps to reduce our exposure to floating interest rates as described below under \u201c-We may utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our variable rate indebtedness and we will be exposed to risks related to counterparty creditworthiness or non-performance of these instruments.\u201d However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\nServicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors, some of which are not within our control.\nOur ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. To a certain extent, this is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt and to meet our other commitments, we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, sell material assets or operations, or raise additional debt or equity capital. We may not be able to affect any of these actions on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and these actions may not be sufficient to meet our capital requirements. In addition, any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at a higher interest rate, and the terms of our existing or future debt arrangements may restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives. Our failure to make the required interest and principal payments on our indebtedness would result in an event of default under the agreement governing such indebtedness, which may result in the acceleration of some or all of our outstanding indebtedness.\nDespite our high indebtedness level, we and our subsidiaries will still be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions and, under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial.\nThe agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness, including indebtedness incurred or to be incurred in connection with the Proposed Core-Mark Acquisition, contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur, assume, or permit to exist additional indebtedness or guarantees;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nmake investments and loans;\n\u2022\npay dividends, make payments, or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers, liquidations, dissolutions, asset sales, and other dispositions (including sale leaseback transactions);\n\u2022\namend or otherwise alter terms of certain indebtedness;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements limiting subsidiary distributions or containing negative pledge clauses;\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nalter the business that we conduct;\n\u2022\nchange our fiscal year; or\n\u2022\nengage in any activities other than permitted activities.\nAs a result of these restrictions, we are limited as to how we conduct our business and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. The terms of any future indebtedness we may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.\nA breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of these agreements, including as a result of cross default provisions, and, in the case of our ABL Facility, permit the lenders to cease making loans to us.\nWe may utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates on our variable rate indebtedness and we will be exposed to risks related to counterparty credit worthiness or non-performance of these instruments.\nWe may enter into pay-fixed interest rate swaps to limit our exposure to changes in variable interest rates. Such instruments may result in economic losses should interest rates decline to a point lower than our fixed rate commitments. We will be exposed to credit-related losses, which could affect the results of operations in the event of fluctuations in the fair value of the interest rate swaps due to a change in the credit worthiness or non-performance by the counterparties to the interest rate swaps.", "PERMNO": 79517, "SIC": 5140, "TIC": "PFGC"}
