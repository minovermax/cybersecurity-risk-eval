{"cik": "1506928", "company": "Avinger Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects. Our business could be harmed by any of these risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and related notes. Please also see \u201cCautionary Notes Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur quarterly and annual results may fluctuate significantly, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business and may result in decreases in the price of our common stock.\nOur quarterly and annual results of operations, including our revenues, profitability and cash flow, may vary significantly in the future and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter or period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly and annual financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control and, as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying performance of our business. Fluctuation in quarterly and annual results may decrease the value of our common stock. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results include, without limitation:\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain and maintain FDA clearance and approval from foreign regulatory authorities for our products, particularly our Pantheris atherectomy device, which has not yet been approved for marketing;\n\u00b7 market acceptance of our lumivascular platform;\n\u00b7 the availability of reimbursement for our lumivascular platform products;\n\u00b7 our ability to attract new customers and grow our business with existing customers;\n\u00b7 results of our clinical trials, particularly our VISION trial for Pantheris;\n\u00b7 the timing and success of new product and feature introductions by us or our competitors or any other change in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors, customers or strategic partners;\n\u00b7 the amount and timing of costs and expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business and operations;\n\u00b7 changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n\u00b7 general economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u00b7 the regulatory environment;\n\u00b7 the hiring, training and retention of key employees, including our ability to expand our sales team;\n\u00b7 litigation or other claims against us;\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain additional financing; and\n\u00b7 advances and trends in new technologies and industry standards.\nWe have a history of net losses and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant losses in each period since our inception in 2007. We incurred net losses of $32.0 million in 2014, $39.9 million in 2013 and $33.9 million in 2012. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $146.5 million. These losses and our accumulated deficit reflect the substantial investments we have made to develop our lumivascular platform and acquire customers.\nWe expect our costs and expenses to increase in the future due to anticipated increases in cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses, research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses and, therefore, we expect our losses to continue for the foreseeable future as we continue to make significant future expenditures to develop and expand our business. In addition, as a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability in the future or that, if we do become profitable, we will sustain profitability. Our failure to achieve and sustain profitability would negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nOur limited commercialization experience and number of approved products makes it difficult to evaluate our current business, predict our future prospects and forecast our financial performance and growth.\nWe were incorporated in 2007, began commercializing our initial non-lumivascular platform products in 2009 and introduced our first lumivascular platform products in the United States in late 2012. Our limited commercialization experience and number of approved products make it difficult to evaluate our current business and predict our future prospects. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies in rapidly-changing industries. These risks and uncertainties include the risks inherent in clinical trials and increasing and unforeseen expenses as we continue to attempt to grow our business.\nOur short commercialization experience and limited number of approved products also make it difficult for us to forecast our future financial performance and growth and such forecasts are limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to successfully complete our VISION clinical trial and obtain FDA clearance for, and successfully commercialize, Pantheris in the United States. If our assumptions regarding the risks and uncertainties we face, which we use to plan our business, are incorrect or change due to circumstances in our business or our markets, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain FDA clearance for, and successfully commercialize, Pantheris. This device is still in clinical trials, has been used in only a limited number of procedures and there is no long-term data on its safety and efficacy.\nThe long-term viability of our company is largely dependent on the successful development and commercialization of Pantheris. In March 2015, we completed enrollment of patients in a clinical study called VISION that will be used to support regulatory clearance of Pantheris, and we do not have significant long term data on Pantheris\u2019 safety and efficacy. While we expect to successfully complete the on-going study and file our 510(k) submission for Pantheris in the second half of 2015 with FDA, there can be no guarantee that the study will be completed, that the primary endpoints will be achieved, or that we will receive regulatory clearance for the sale and marketing of Pantheris in the United States. Although we have collected preliminary data for our VISION trial, this preliminary data may not be predictive of its final results and failure of the trial can occur at any time. A number of companies in the medical device field have suffered significant setbacks during clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or unacceptable safety issues, notwithstanding promising preliminary results. Because we are depending heavily on sales of Pantheris to achieve our revenue goals, failure to successfully complete the study and receive FDA clearance, in a timely manner or at all, will harm our financial results and ability to become profitable. Even if we obtain regulatory clearance, our ability to successfully market this product will be limited due to a number of factors including regulatory restrictions in our labeling. In addition, there can be no guarantee that Pantheris will be accepted by the medical community as a valid alternative to currently available devices. If we cannot sell Pantheris as planned, our financial results will be harmed.\nFailure to successfully complete our Pantheris clinical study would significantly impair our financial results. Such a failure could (i) delay or prevent Pantheris from obtaining regulatory clearance, (ii) require us to perform another clinical trial, which will be expensive, may not be successful and will significantly delay our ability to commercialize Pantheris and (iii) impair our ability to convince hospitals and physicians of the benefits of our lumivascular platform products.\nWe may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs and our failure to obtain additional financing when needed could force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs and commercialization efforts.\nWe believe that the net proceeds from our initial public offering in January of $56.8 million, total cash proceeds of $6.2 million from our Series E preferred stock financing in January 2015 together with our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014 and expected revenues from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our capital requirements and fund our operations for at least 18 months following the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We will likely need additional funds to meet our operational needs and capital requirements for product development, clinical trials and commercialization.\nPrior to our initial public offering, we have financed our operations primarily through sales of our products, net proceeds from the issuance of our preferred stock and debt financings. We do not know when or if our operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our ongoing operations. In the future, we may require additional capital in order to (i) continue to conduct research and development activities, (ii) conduct\npost-market clinical studies, as well as clinical trials to obtain regulatory clearances and approvals necessary to commercialize our lumivascular platform products, (iii) expand our sales and marketing infrastructure and (iv) acquire complementary business technology or products; or (v) respond to business opportunities, challenges, a decline in sales, increased regulatory obligations or unforeseen circumstances. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the costs, timing and outcomes of clinical trials and regulatory reviews associated with our future products, including Pantheris;\n\u00b7 the costs and expenses of expanding our sales and marketing infrastructure and our manufacturing operations;\n\u00b7 the costs and timing of developing variations of our lumivascular platform products, especially Pantheris, and, if necessary, obtaining FDA clearance of such variations;\n\u00b7 the degree of success we experience in commercializing our lumivascular platform products, particularly Pantheris;\n\u00b7 the extent to which our lumivascular platform is adopted by hospitals for use by interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists in the treatment of PAD;\n\u00b7 the number and types of future products we develop and commercialize;\n\u00b7 the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications and maintaining, enforcing and defending intellectual property-related claims; and\n\u00b7 the extent and scope of our general and administrative expenses.\nWe may raise funds in equity or debt financings following our initial public offering or enter into credit facilities in order to access funds for our capital needs. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future would cause us to incur additional debt service expenses and could include restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and pursue business opportunities. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, we may terminate or delay the development of one or more of our products, delay clinical trials necessary to market our products, or delay establishment of sales and marketing capabilities or other activities necessary to commercialize our products. If this were to occur, our ability to continue to grow and support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited.\nWe have a significant amount of debt, which may affect our ability to operate our business and secure additional financing in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $20.4 million in principal and interest outstanding under our credit facility, or the credit agreement, with PDL Biopharma, or PDL, and $8.6 million in principal plus interest outstanding under convertible promissory notes, or the notes. We must make significant annual debt payments under the credit agreement, which diverts resources from other activities. Our debt with PDL is collateralized by substantially all of our assets and contains customary financial and operating covenants limiting our ability to, among other things, dispose of assets, undergo a change in control, merge or consolidate, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, make acquisitions, incur debt, incur liens, pay dividends, repurchase stock and make investments, in each case subject to certain exceptions. In addition to the interest and principal payments due under the credit agreement, we are obligated to pay PDL a royalty at the rate of 1.8% of our quarterly revenues through the maturity date of April 18, 2018. To the extent that we prepay the borrowings under the credit agreement, our royalty obligations will continue and will be payable through the maturity date at the higher of a reduced rate of 0.9% of our quarterly revenues or certain minimum amounts. During this period, we must continue to comply with covenants limiting our ability to, among other things, undergo a change in control and dispose of assets, in each case subject to certain exceptions. These covenants may make it difficult to operate our business. We are also subject to standard event of default provisions both under the credit agreement and the notes that, if triggered, would allow the debt to be accelerated, which could significantly deplete our cash resources, cause us to raise additional capital at unfavorable terms, require us to sell portions of our business or result in us becoming insolvent. The existing collateral pledged under the credit agreement, the covenants to which we are bound and the obligation to pay a certain percentage of our future revenues to PDL, even after the PDL debt is repaid, may prevent us from being able to secure additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, or at all, or to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, we are obligated to pay our former financial advisor a transaction fee of $487,500.\nWe depend on a limited number of products, which we only recently introduced in the United States. If these products fail to gain, or lose, market acceptance, our business will suffer.\nOcelot, Ocelot PIXL, Ocelot MVRX, Lightbox, Wildcat and Kittycat 2 are our only products currently cleared for sale, and our current revenues are wholly dependent on them. Sales of Wildcat and Kittycat 2 have declined and are continuing to decline as we focus on the promotion of our lumivascular platform products. We expect that sales of our current and future lumivascular platform products in the United States will account for substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future. Because of their recent commercial introduction, our lumivascular platform products have limited product and brand recognition. We do not know if our lumivascular platform products will be successful over the long term and market acceptance may be hindered if physicians are not presented with compelling data from long-term studies of the safety and efficacy of our lumivascular platform products compared to alternative procedures, such as angioplasty, stenting, bypass surgery or other atherectomy procedures. For example, if patients undergoing treatment with our lumivascular platform products have retreatment rates higher than or comparable with the retreatment rates of alternative procedures, it will be difficult to demonstrate the value of our lumivascular platform products. Any studies we may conduct comparing our lumivascular platform with alternative procedures will be expensive, time consuming and may not yield positive results. Physicians will also need to appreciate the value of real-time imaging in improving patient outcomes in order to change current methods for treating PAD patients. In addition, demand for our lumivascular platform products may decline or may not increase as quickly as we expect. Failure of our lumivascular platform products to significantly penetrate current or new markets would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also aware of certain characteristics and features of our lumivascular platform that may prevent widespread market adoption. For example, the current model of Pantheris may require two physicians to operate the catheter and a technician to operate the Lightbox, making it less financially attractive for physicians. It may take significant time and expense to modify our products to allow a single physician to operate the entire system and we can provide no guarantee that we will be able to make such modifications, or obtain any additional and necessary regulatory clearances for such modifications. Also, although the OCT images created by our Lightbox may make it possible for physicians to reduce the degree to which fluoroscopy and contrast dye are used when using our lumivascular platform products compared to competing endovascular products, physicians are still using both fluoroscopy and contrast dye, particularly with Pantheris. As a result, risks of complications from radiation and contrast dye are still present and may limit the commercial success of our products. Finally, it will require training for technicians and physicians to effectively operate our lumivascular platform products, including interpreting the OCT images created by our Lightbox, which may affect adoption of our products by physicians. These or other characteristics and features of our lumivascular platform may cause our products not to be widely adopted and harm our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nOur ability to compete is highly dependent on demonstrating the benefits of our lumivascular platform to physicians, hospitals and patients.\nIn order to generate sales, we must be able to clearly demonstrate that our lumivascular platform is both a more effective treatment system and less costly than the alternatives offered by our competitors. If we are unable to convince physicians that our lumivascular platform leads to significantly lower restenosis, or narrowing of the artery, rates and fewer adverse events during surgery than those using competing technologies, our business will suffer. In order to use our Ocelot family of catheters or, if cleared, Pantheris, hospitals must make an investment in our Lightbox. Accordingly, we must convince hospitals and physicians that our lumivascular platform results in significantly better patient outcomes at a competitive overall cost. For example, we may need to demonstrate that the investment hospitals must make when purchasing our Lightbox and the incremental costs of having up to two physicians operate Pantheris can be justified based on the benefits to patients, physicians and hospitals. If we are unable to develop robust clinical data to support these claims we will be unable to convince hospitals and third-party payors of these benefits and our business will suffer.\nOur value proposition to physicians and hospitals is largely dependent upon our contention that the rate of disruption of the black line when physicians are using our products is lower than with competing products. If minimizing disruption to the black line does not significantly impact patient outcomes, meaning either (i) that restenosis is often triggered without disrupting the black line, or (ii) the black line can often be disrupted without triggering restenosis, then we may be unable to demonstrate our lumivascular platform\u2019s benefits are any different than competing technologies. Furthermore, physicians may find our imaging system difficult to use and we may not provide physicians with adequate training to be able to realize the benefits of our lumivascular platform. If physicians do not value the benefits of on-board imaging and the enhanced visualization enabled by our products during an endovascular intervention as compared to our competitor\u2019s products, or do not believe that such benefits improve clinical outcomes, our lumivascular platform products may not be widely adopted.\nThe use, misuse or off-label use of the products in our lumivascular platform may result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business.\nWe require limited training in the use of our lumivascular platform products because we market primarily to physicians who are experienced in the interventional techniques required to use our device. If demand for our lumivascular platform continues to grow, less experienced physicians will likely use the device, potentially leading to more injury and an increased risk of product liability claims. The use or\nmisuse of our lumivascular platform products has in the past resulted, and may in the future result, in complications, including damage to the treated artery, infection, internal bleeding, and limb loss, potentially leading to product liability claims. Our lumivascular platform products are not FDA-cleared or approved for use in the carotid, cerebral, coronary, iliac, or renal arteries. Our sales force does not promote the use of our products for off-label indications, and our U.S. instructions for use specify that our lumivascular platform products are not intended for use in the carotid, cerebral, coronary, iliac or renal arteries. However, we cannot prevent a physician from using our lumivascular platform products for these off-label applications. The application of our lumivascular platform products to coronary arteries, as opposed to peripheral arteries, is more likely to result in complications that have serious consequences. For example, if excised plaque were not captured properly in our device, it could be carried by the bloodstream to a more narrow location, blocking a coronary artery, leading to a heart attack, or blocking an artery to the brain, leading to a stroke. If our lumivascular platform products are defectively designed, manufactured or labeled, contain defective components or are misused, we may become subject to costly litigation initiated by our customers or their patients. Product liability claims are especially prevalent in the medical device industry and could harm our reputation, divert management\u2019s attention from our core business, be expensive to defend and may result in sizable damage awards against us. Although we maintain product liability insurance, the amount or breadth of our coverage may not be adequate for the claims that are made against us.\nThe expense and potential unavailability of insurance coverage for liabilities resulting from our products could harm us and our ability to sell our lumivascular platform products.\nWe may not have sufficient insurance coverage for future product liability claims. We may not be able to obtain insurance in amounts or scope sufficient to provide us with adequate coverage against all potential liabilities. Any product liability claims brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing continuing coverage, harm our reputation in the industry, significantly increase our expenses, and reduce product sales. Product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage would be paid out of cash reserves, harming our financial condition and operating results.\nSome of our customers and prospective customers may have difficulty in procuring or maintaining liability insurance to cover their operations and use of our lumivascular platform products. Medical malpractice carriers are withdrawing coverage in certain states or substantially increasing premiums. If this trend continues or worsens, our customers may discontinue using our lumivascular platform products and potential customers may opt against purchasing our lumivascular platform products due to the cost or inability to procure insurance coverage.\nOur ability to compete depends on our ability to innovate successfully.\nThe market for medical devices in general, and in the PAD market in particular, is highly competitive, dynamic, and marked by rapid and substantial technological development and product innovation. There are few barriers that would prevent new entrants or existing competitors from developing products that compete directly with ours. Demand for our lumivascular platform products could be diminished by equivalent or superior products and technologies offered by competitors. If we are unable to innovate successfully, our lumivascular platform products could become obsolete and our revenues would decline as our customers purchase our competitors\u2019 products.\nThe medical device market is characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change. Technological progress or new developments in our industry could harm sales of our products. Our products could be rendered obsolete because of future innovations in the treatment of PAD. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to develop new product offerings and enhancements to our existing lumivascular platform products. Maintaining adequate research and development personnel and resources to meet the demands of the market is essential. If we are unable to develop products, applications or features due to certain constraints, such as insufficient cash resources, inability to raise sufficient cash in future equity or debt financings, high employee turnover, inability to hire sufficient research and development personnel or a lack of other research and development resources, we may miss market opportunities. Furthermore, many of our competitors expend a considerably greater amount of funds on their research and development programs than we do, and those that do not may be acquired by larger companies that would allocate greater resources to our competitors\u2019 research and development programs. Our failure or inability to devote adequate research and development resources or compete effectively with the research and development programs of our competitors could harm our business.\nWe compete against companies that have longer operating histories, more established products and greater resources, which may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration, increasing our revenues or becoming profitable.\nOur products compete with a variety of products and devices for the treatment of PAD, including other CTO crossing devices, stents, balloons and atherectomy catheters, as well as products used in vascular surgery. Large competitors in the CTO crossing, stent and balloon markets include Abbott Laboratories, BARD, Boston Scientific, Cook Medical, Covidien, Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic. Competitors in the atherectomy market include Boston Scientific, Cardiovascular Systems, Covidien, Spectranetics and Volcano. Some competitors have previously attempted to combine intravascular imaging with atherectomy and may have current programs underway to do so. These and other companies may attempt to incorporate on-board visualization into their products in the future and may remain competitive with us in marketing traditional technologies. Other competitors include pharmaceutical companies that manufacture drugs for the treatment of symptoms associated with mild to moderate PAD and companies that provide products used by surgeons in peripheral and coronary bypass procedures. These competitors and other\ncompanies may introduce new products that compete with our products. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do and have well-established reputations, as well as broader product offerings and worldwide distribution channels that are significantly larger and more effective than ours. Competition with these companies could result in price-cutting, reduced profit margins and loss of market share, any of which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to distinguish our company and our lumivascular platform from our competitors and their products, and includes such factors as:\n\u00b7 procedural safety and efficacy;\n\u00b7 acute and long-term outcomes;\n\u00b7 ease of use and procedure time;\n\u00b7 price;\n\u00b7 size and effectiveness of sales force;\n\u00b7 radiation exposure for physicians, hospital staff and patients; and\n\u00b7 third-party reimbursement.\nIn addition, competitors with greater financial resources than ours could acquire other companies to gain enhanced name recognition and market share, as well as new technologies or products that could effectively compete with our existing products, which may cause our revenues to decline and would harm our business.\nIf our clinical trials are unsuccessful or significantly delayed, or if we do not complete our clinical trials, our business may be harmed.\nClinical development is a long, expensive, and uncertain process and is subject to delays and the risk that products may ultimately prove unsafe or ineffective in treating the indications for which they are designed. Completion of clinical trials may take several years or more. We cannot provide any assurance that our clinical trials will meet their primary endpoints or that such trials or their results will be accepted by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. Even if we achieve positive early or preliminary results in clinical trials, these results do not necessarily predict final results, and positive results in early trials may not indicate success in later trials. Many companies in the medical device industry have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials, even after receiving promising results in earlier trials or in the preliminary results from these late-stage clinical trials.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or because of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent us from receiving regulatory clearance or approval for new products or modifications of existing products, including new indications for existing products, including:\n\u00b7 our clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical and/or preclinical testing which may be expensive and time consuming;\n\u00b7 trial results may not meet the level of statistical significance required by FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7 FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities may find the product is not sufficiently safe for investigational use in humans;\n\u00b7 FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities may interpret data from preclinical testing and clinical trials in different ways than we do;\n\u00b7 there may be delays or failure in obtaining approval of our clinical trial protocols from FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7 there may be delays in obtaining institutional review board approvals or government approvals to conduct clinical trials at prospective sites;\n\u00b7 FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities may find our or our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing processes or facilities unsatisfactory;\n\u00b7 FDA or similar foreign regulatory authorities may change their review policies or adopt new regulations that may negatively affect or delay our ability to bring a product to market or receive approvals or clearances to treat new indications;\n\u00b7 we may have trouble in managing multiple clinical sites;\n\u00b7 we may experience delays in agreeing on acceptable terms with third-party research organizations and trial sites that may help us conduct the clinical trials; and\n\u00b7 we, or regulators, may suspend or terminate our clinical trials because the participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks.\nFailures or perceived failures in our clinical trials will delay and may prevent our product development and regulatory approval process, damage our business prospects and negatively affect our reputation and competitive position.\nFrom time to time, we engage outside parties to perform services related to certain of our clinical studies and trials, and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obligations could increase costs and cause delays.\nFrom time to time, we engage consultants to help design, monitor, and analyze the results of certain of our clinical studies and trials. The consultants we engage interact with clinical investigators to enroll patients in our clinical trials. We depend on these consultants and clinical investigators to help facilitate the clinical studies and trials and monitor and analyze data from these studies and trials under the investigational plan and protocol for the study or trial and in compliance with applicable regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices. We may face delays in our regulatory approval process if these parties do not perform their obligations in a timely, compliant or competent manner. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their duties or meet expected deadlines, or if the quality, completeness or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical trial protocols or for other reasons, our clinical studies or trials may be extended, delayed or terminated or may otherwise prove to be unsuccessful, and we may have to conduct additional studies, which would significantly increase our costs, in order to obtain the regulatory clearances that we need to commercialize our products.\nWe have no long-term data regarding the safety and efficacy of our lumivascular platform products. Any long-term data that is generated by clinical trials involving our lumivascular platform may not be positive or consistent with our short-term data, which would harm our ability to obtain clearance to market and sell our products.\nOur lumivascular platform is a novel system, and our success depends on its acceptance by the medical community as being safe and effective, and improving clinical outcomes. Important factors upon which the efficacy of our lumivascular platform products will be measured are long-term data on the rate of restenosis following our procedure, and the corresponding duration of patency, or openness of the artery, and publication of that data in peer-reviewed journals. Another important factor that physicians will consider is the rate of reintervention, or retreatment, following the use of our lumivascular platform products. The long-term clinical benefits of procedures that use our lumivascular platform products are not known.\nThe results of short-term clinical experience of our lumivascular platform products do not necessarily predict long-term clinical benefit. Restenosis rates typically increase over time. We believe that physicians will compare the rates of long-term restenosis and reintervention for procedures using our lumivascular platform products against alternative procedures, such as angioplasty, stenting, bypass surgery and other atherectomy procedures. If the long-term rates of restenosis and reintervention do not meet physicians\u2019 expectations, our lumivascular platform products may not become widely adopted and physicians may recommend alternative treatments for their patients. Another significant factor that physicians will consider is acute safety data on complications that occur during the use of our lumivascular platform products. If the results obtained from our VISION trial or any post-market studies that we conduct or post-clearance surveillance indicate that the use of our lumivascular platform products are not as safe or effective as other treatment options or as current short-term data would suggest, adoption of our product may suffer and our business would be harmed. Even if we believe the data collected from clinical studies or clinical experience indicate positive results, each physician\u2019s actual experience with our products will vary. Physicians who are technically proficient participate in our clinical trials and are high-volume users of our lumivascular platform products. Consequently, the results of our clinical trials and their experiences using our products may lead to better patient outcomes than those of physicians that are less proficient, perform fewer procedures or who use our products infrequently.\nOur ability to market our current products in the United States is limited to use in peripheral vessels, and if we want to market our products for other uses, we will need to file for FDA clearances or approvals and may need to conduct trials in addition to VISION to support expanded use, which would be expensive, time-consuming and may not be successful.\nOur current products are cleared in the United States solely for crossing sub-total and chronic total occlusions in the peripheral vasculature. This clearance prohibits our ability to market or advertise our products for any other indication within the peripheral vasculature, which restricts our ability to sell these products and could affect our growth. Additionally, our products are contraindicated for use in the cerebral, carotid, coronary, iliac, and renal arteries. While off-label uses of medical devices are common and FDA does not regulate physicians\u2019 choice of treatments, FDA does restrict a manufacturer\u2019s communications regarding such off-label use. We are not allowed to actively promote or advertise our products for off-label uses. In addition, we cannot make comparative claims regarding the use of our products against any alternative treatments without conducting head-to-head comparative clinical studies, which would be expensive and time consuming. If our promotional activities fail to comply with FDA\u2019s regulations or guidelines, we may be subject to FDA warnings or enforcement action by FDA and other\ngovernment agencies. In the future, if we want to market a variation of Ocelot or Pantheris in the United States for use in coronary arteries, we will need to make modifications to these products, conduct further clinical trials and obtain new clearances or approvals from FDA. There can be no assurance that we will successfully develop these modifications, that future clinical studies will be successful or that the expense of these activities will be offset by additional revenues.\nThe continuing development of many of our products, including Pantheris, depends upon maintaining strong working relationships with physicians.\nThe development, marketing, and sale of our products, including Pantheris, depends upon our ability to maintain strong working relationships with physicians. We rely on these professionals to provide us with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development, marketing and sale of our products. Physicians assist us in clinical trials and as researchers, marketing and product consultants and public speakers. If we cannot maintain our strong working relationships with these professionals and continue to receive their advice and input, the development and marketing of our products could suffer, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The medical device industry\u2019s relationship with physicians is under increasing scrutiny by the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, or OIG, the Department of Justice, or DOJ, state attorneys general, and other foreign and domestic government agencies. Our failure to comply with laws, rules and regulations governing our relationships with physicians, or an investigation into our compliance by the OIG, DOJ, state attorneys general and other government agencies, could significantly harm our business.\nIf we fail to grow our sales and marketing capabilities and develop widespread brand awareness cost effectively, our growth will be impeded and our business may suffer.\nWe plan to continue to expand and optimize our sales infrastructure in order to grow our customer base and our business. Identifying and recruiting qualified personnel and training them in the use of our lumivascular platform, and on applicable federal and state laws and regulations and our internal policies and procedures, requires significant time, expense and attention. It can take several months before our sales representatives are fully trained and productive. Our business may be harmed if our efforts to expand and train our sales force do not generate a corresponding increase in revenues. In particular, if we are unable to hire, develop and retain talented sales personnel or if new sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of this investment or increase our revenues.\nOur ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our lumivascular platform will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our marketing operations. We plan to dedicate significant financial and other resources to our marketing programs. Our business will be harmed if our marketing efforts and expenditures do not generate an increase in revenue.\nIn addition, we believe that developing and maintaining widespread awareness of our brand in a cost-effective manner is critical to achieving widespread acceptance of our lumivascular platform and attracting new customers. Brand promotion activities may not generate customer awareness or increase revenues, and even if they do, any increase in revenues may not offset the costs and expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote, maintain and protect our brand, we may fail to attract or retain the customers necessary to realize a sufficient return on our brand-building efforts, or to achieve the widespread brand awareness that is critical for broad customer adoption of our lumivascular platform.\nIf we are unable to manage the anticipated growth of our business, our future revenues and operating results may be harmed.\nAny growth that we experience in the future could provide challenges to our organization, requiring us to expand our sales personnel and manufacturing operations and general and administrative infrastructure. We expect to grow our sales force in anticipation of obtaining marketing clearance for Pantheris. Rapid expansion in personnel could mean that less experienced people produce and sell our products, which could result in inefficiencies and unanticipated costs and disruptions to our operations.\nWe have limited experience manufacturing our lumivascular platform products in commercial quantities, which could harm our business.\nBecause we have only limited experience in manufacturing our lumivascular platform products in commercial quantities, we may encounter production delays or shortfalls. Such production delays or shortfalls may be caused by many factors, including the following:\n\u00b7 we intend to significantly expand our manufacturing capacity, and our production processes may have to change to accommodate this growth;\n\u00b7 key components and sub-assemblies of our lumivascular platform products are currently provided by a single supplier or limited number of suppliers, and we do not maintain large inventory levels of these components and sub-assemblies; if we experience a shortage in any of these components or sub-assemblies, we would need to identify and qualify new supply sources, which could increase our expenses and result in manufacturing delays;\n\u00b7 we may experience a delay in completing validation and verification testing for new controlled-environment rooms at our manufacturing facilities;\n\u00b7 we have limited experience in complying with FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, which applies to the manufacture of our lumivascular platform products; and\n\u00b7 to increase our manufacturing output significantly, we will have to attract and retain qualified employees, who are in short supply, for our manufacturing operations.\nIf we are unable to keep up with demand for our lumivascular platform products, our revenues could be impaired, market acceptance for our lumivascular platform products could be harmed and our customers might instead purchase our competitors\u2019 products. Our inability to successfully manufacture our lumivascular platform products would materially harm our business.\nOur manufacturing facilities and processes and those of our third-party suppliers are subject to unannounced FDA and state regulatory inspections for compliance with Quality System regulations. Developing and maintaining a compliant quality system is time consuming and expensive. Failure to maintain, or not fully comply with the requirements of, a quality system could result in regulatory authorities initiating enforcement actions against us and our third-party suppliers, which could include the issuance of warning letters, seizures, prohibitions on product sales, recalls and civil and criminal penalties, any one of which could significantly impact our manufacturing supply and impair our financial results.\nIf our manufacturing facility becomes damaged or inoperable, or we are required to vacate the facility, our ability to manufacture and sell our lumivascular platform products and to pursue our research and development efforts may be jeopardized.\nWe currently manufacture and assemble our lumivascular platform products in-house. Our products are comprised of components sourced from a variety of contract manufacturers, with final assembly completed at our facility in Redwood City, California. Our facility and equipment, or those of our suppliers, could be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including fire, earthquake, terrorism, flooding and power outages. Any of these may render it difficult or impossible for us to manufacture products for some period of time. If our facility is inoperable for even a short period of time, the inability to manufacture our current products, and the interruption in research and development of any future products, may result in harm to our reputation, increased costs, lower revenues and the loss of customers. Furthermore, it could be costly and time-consuming to repair or replace our facilities and the equipment we use to perform our research and development work and manufacture our products.\nWe depend on third-party vendors to manufacture some of our components and sub-assemblies, which could make us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations that could harm our business.\nWe currently manufacture some of our components and sub-assemblies at our Redwood City facility and rely on third-party vendors for other components and sub-assemblies used in our lumivascular platform. Our reliance on third-party vendors subjects us to a number of risks that could impact our ability to manufacture our products and harm our business, including:\n\u00b7 interruption of supply resulting from modifications to, or discontinuation of, a supplier\u2019s operations;\n\u00b7 delays in product shipments resulting from uncorrected defects, reliability issues or a supplier\u2019s failure to consistently produce quality components;\n\u00b7 price fluctuations due to a lack of long-term supply arrangements with our suppliers for key components;\n\u00b7 inability to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u00b7 difficulty identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers for components in a timely manner;\n\u00b7 inability of the manufacturer or supplier to comply with Quality System regulations enforced by the FDA and state regulatory authorities;\n\u00b7 inability to control the quality of products manufactured by third parties;\n\u00b7 production delays related to the evaluation and testing of products from alternative suppliers and corresponding regulatory qualifications; and\n\u00b7 delays in delivery by our suppliers due to changes in demand from us or their other customers.\nAny significant delay or interruption in the supply of components or sub-assemblies, or our inability to obtain substitute components, sub-assemblies or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and harm our business.\nWe depend on single and limited source suppliers for some of our product components and sub-assemblies, and if any of those suppliers are unable or unwilling to produce these components and sub-assemblies or supply them in the quantities that we need, we would experience manufacturing delays.\nWe rely on single and limited source suppliers for several of our components and sub-assemblies. For example, we rely on single vendors for our optical fiber and drive cables, that are key components of our catheters, and we rely on a single vendor for our data acquisition card in Lightbox. These components are critical to our products and there are relatively few alternative sources of supply. We do not carry a significant inventory of these components. Identifying and qualifying additional or replacement suppliers for any of the components or sub-assemblies used in our products could involve significant time and cost. Any supply interruption from our vendors or failure to obtain additional vendors for any of the components or sub-assemblies incorporated into our products would limit our ability to manufacture our products and could therefore harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future growth depends on physician adoption of our lumivascular platform products, which may require physicians to change their current practices.\nWe intend to educate physicians on the capabilities of our lumivascular platform products and advances in treatment for PAD patients. We target our sales efforts to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists because they are often the physicians diagnosing and treating both coronary artery disease and PAD. However, the initial point of contact for many patients may be general practitioners, podiatrists, nephrologists and endocrinologists, each of whom commonly treat patients experiencing complications or symptoms resulting from PAD. If these physicians are not made aware of our lumivascular platform products, they may not refer patients to interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists for treatment using our lumivascular platform procedure, and those patients may instead be surgically treated or treated with an alternative interventional procedure. In addition, there is a significant correlation between PAD and coronary artery disease, and many physicians do not routinely screen for PAD while screening for coronary artery disease. If we are not successful in educating physicians about screening for PAD and about the capabilities of our lumivascular platform products, our ability to increase our revenues may be impaired.\nWe depend on our senior management team and the loss of one or more key employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could harm our business.\nOur success largely depends upon the continued services of our executive management team and key employees and the loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could harm us and directly impact our financial results. Our employees may terminate their employment with us at any time. Changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, including the recent addition of our chief executive officer, could disrupt our business. In particular, our founder, Dr. John Simpson, is the visionary behind many of our product development activities and he actively supports our clinical trials and physician education and training efforts. If Dr. Simpson was no longer working at our company, our industry credibility, product development efforts and physician relationships would be harmed. We do not currently maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees, including Dr. Simpson.\nTo execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for skilled personnel is intense, especially for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing medical devices and for sales executives. We have, from time to time, experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources and, potentially, damages. In addition, job candidates and existing employees, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our stock awards declines, it may harm our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. In addition, we invest significant time and expense in training our employees, which increases their value to competitors who may seek to recruit them. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects would be harmed.\nWe do not currently intend to devote significant additional resources in the near-term to market our lumivascular platform internationally, which will limit our potential revenues from our lumivascular platform products.\nMarketing our lumivascular platform outside of the United States would require substantial additional sales and marketing, regulatory and personnel expenses. As part of our product development and regulatory strategy, we plan to expand into select European markets, but we do not currently intend to devote significant additional resources to market our lumivascular platform internationally in order to focus our resources\nand efforts on the U.S. market. Our decision to market our products primarily in the United States in the near-term will limit our ability to reach all of our potential markets and will limit our potential sources of revenue. In addition, our competitors will have an opportunity to further penetrate and achieve market share outside of the United States until such time, if ever, that we devote significant additional resources to market our lumivascular platform products or other products internationally.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryovers may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, due to prior period losses of $133.9 million and $134.2 million, respectively, which if not utilized will begin to expire in 2027 for federal purposes and 2015 for state purposes. We may use these NOLs to offset against taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, may limit the NOLs we may use in any year for U.S. federal income tax purposes in the event of certain changes in ownership of our company. A Section 382 \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. This offering or future issuances or sales of our stock (including certain transactions involving our stock that are outside of our control) could cause an \u201cownership change.\u201d If an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs, Section 382 would impose an annual limit on the amount of pre-ownership change NOLs and other tax attributes we can use to reduce our taxable income, potentially increasing and accelerating our liability for income taxes, and also potentially causing those tax attributes to expire unused. Any limitation on using NOLs could (depending on the extent of such limitation and the NOLs previously used) result in our retaining less cash after payment of U.S. federal income taxes during any year in which we have taxable income (rather than losses) than we would be entitled to retain if such NOLs were available as an offset against such income for U.S. federal income tax reporting purposes, which could harm our profitability.\nThe forecasts of market growth included in this Annual Report on Form-10K may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the markets in which we compete achieve the forecasted growth, our business may not grow at similar rates, if at all.\nGrowth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. The forecasts in this Annual Report on Form 10-K relating to, among other things, the expected growth in PAD prevalence, diagnosis and endovascular PAD procedures and the markets therefor and increased awareness, higher diagnosis, and intervention rates, may prove to be inaccurate.\nEven if these markets experience the forecasted growth described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we may not grow our business at similar rates, or at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including whether the market for PAD treatments continues to grow, our ability to successfully complete the VISION trial, obtain 510(k) clearance for Pantheris and commercialize Pantheris, the rate of market acceptance of our lumivascular platform products versus the products of our competitors and our success in implementing our business strategies, each of which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, the forecasts of market growth included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be taken as indicative of our future growth.\nWe may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nWe may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, applications or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our lumivascular platform, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various costs and expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. We may not be able to identify desirable acquisition targets or be successful in entering into an agreement with any particular target or obtain the expected benefits of any acquisition or investment.\nTo date, the growth in our business has been organic, and we have no experience in acquiring other businesses. In any acquisition, we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired personnel, operations and technologies, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities, the use of our available cash, or the incurrence of debt, which could harm our operating results. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business and financial condition may suffer.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may in the future be a party to intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings that could be costly and could interfere with our ability to sell our lumivascular platform products.\nThe medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, and companies in the industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. It is possible\nthat U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications or trademarks controlled by third parties may be alleged to cover our products, or that we may be accused of misappropriating third parties\u2019 trade secrets. Additionally, our products include hardware and software components that we purchase from vendors, and may include design components that are outside of our direct control. Our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent portfolios, trade secrets, trademarks, and competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for or obtain, patents or trademarks that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use, sell and/or export our products or to use product names. We may become a party to patent or trademark infringement or trade secret claims and litigation as a result of these and other third-party intellectual property rights being asserted against us. The defense and prosecution of these matters are both costly and time consuming. Vendors from whom we purchase hardware or software may not indemnify us in the event that such hardware or software is accused of infringing a third-party\u2019s patent or trademark or of misappropriating a third-party\u2019s trade secret.\nFurther, if such patents, trademarks, or trade secrets are successfully asserted against us, this may harm our business and result in injunctions preventing us from selling our products, license fees, damages and the payment of attorney fees and court costs. In addition, if we are found to willfully infringe third-party patents or trademarks or to have misappropriated trade secrets, we could be required to pay treble damages in addition to other penalties. Although patent, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property disputes in the medical device area have often been settled through licensing or similar arrangements, costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties. We may be unable to obtain necessary licenses on satisfactory terms, if at all. If we do not obtain necessary licenses, we may not be able to redesign our lumivascular platform products to avoid infringement.\nSimilarly, interference or derivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions or other matters of inventorship with respect to our patents or patent applications. We may also become involved in other proceedings, such as re-examination, inter partes review, or opposition proceedings, before the USPTO or other jurisdictional body relating to our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others. Adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our lumivascular platform products or using product names, which would have a significant adverse impact on our business.\nAdditionally, we may need to commence proceedings against others to enforce our patents or trademarks, to protect our trade secrets or know-how, or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. These proceedings would result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. We may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing and selling products that are the same or similar to our products or from using product names that are the same or similar to our product names, and our business may be harmed as a result.\nWe are aware of patents held by third parties that may be asserted against us in litigation that could be costly and could limit our ability to sell our lumivascular platform products.\nWe are aware of patent families related to catheter positioning, optical coherence tomography, occlusion cutting and atherectomy owned by third parties. With regard to atherectomy patents, one of our founders, Dr. John Simpson, founded FoxHollow Technologies prior to founding our company. FoxHollow Technologies developed an atherectomy device that is currently sold by Covidien, and Dr. Simpson and our Chief Technology Officer, Himanshu Patel, are listed as inventors on patents covering that device that are now held by Covidien. We are not currently aware of any claims Covidien has made or intends to make against us with respect to Pantheris or any other product or product under development. Because of a doctrine known as \u201cassignor estoppel,\u201d if any of Dr. Simpson\u2019s earlier patents are asserted against us by Covidien, we may be prevented from asserting an invalidity defense regarding those patents, and our defense may be compromised. Covidien has significantly greater financial resources than we do to pursue patent litigation and could assert these patent families against us at any time. Adverse determinations in any such litigation could prevent us from manufacturing or selling Pantheris or other products or products under development, which would significantly harm our business.\nIntellectual property rights may not provide adequate protection, which may permit third parties to compete against us more effectively.\nIn order to remain competitive, we must develop and maintain protection of the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws and confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. As of December 31, 2014, we held five issued U.S. patents and had 14 U.S. utility patent applications and 8 PCT applications pending. As of December 31, 2014, we also had one issued patent from the Japan Patent Office, one issued patent from the Chinese patent office, and one European patent which has been nationalized in Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy and Ireland. As of December 31, 2014, we had 29 pending patent applications outside of the United States, including in Australia, Canada, Europe, India and Japan. Our patents and patent applications include claims covering key aspects of the design, manufacture and therapeutic use of OCT imaging catheters, occlusion-crossing catheters, atherectomy devices and our imaging console. Our patent applications may not result in issued patents and our\npatents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any patents issued to us may be challenged by third parties as being invalid, or third parties may independently develop similar or competing technology that avoids our patents. Should such challenges be successful, competitors might be able to market products and use manufacturing processes that are substantially similar to ours. We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our technical knowledge or other trade secrets by consultants, vendors or former or current employees, despite the existence generally of confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions. Monitoring unauthorized use and disclosure of our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate. In addition, the laws of many foreign countries will not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Consequently, we may be unable to prevent our proprietary technology from being exploited abroad, which could affect our ability to expand to international markets or require costly efforts to protect our technology. To the extent our intellectual property protection is incomplete, we are exposed to a greater risk of direct competition. In addition, competitors could purchase our products and attempt to replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts or design around our protected technology. Our failure to secure, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could substantially harm the value of our lumivascular platform, brand and business.\nWe use certain open source software in Lightbox. We may face claims from companies that incorporate open source software into their products or from open source licensors, claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the source code, the open source software or derivative works that were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to cease offering Lightbox unless and until we can re-engineer it to avoid infringement. This re-engineering process could require significant additional research and development resources, and we may not be able to complete it successfully. These risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nFailure to comply with laws and regulations could harm our business.\nOur business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies, including agencies responsible for monitoring and enforcing employment and labor laws, workplace safety, environmental laws, consumer protection laws, anti-bribery laws, import/export controls, federal securities laws and tax laws and regulations. In certain jurisdictions, these regulatory requirements may be more stringent than those in the United States and in other circumstances these requirements may be more stringent in the United States. Noncompliance with applicable regulations or requirements could subject us to investigations, sanctions, mandatory recalls, enforcement actions, adverse publicity, disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, civil and criminal penalties or injunctions and administrative actions. If any governmental sanctions, fines or penalties are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and substantial costs. Enforcement actions and sanctions could further harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we fail to obtain and maintain necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for our lumivascular platform products, or if clearances or approvals for future products and indications are delayed or not issued, our commercial operations would be harmed.\nOur lumivascular platform products are medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation by FDA in the United States and by regulatory agencies in other countries where we do business. Government regulations specific to medical devices are wide-ranging and govern, among other things:\n\u00b7 product design, development and manufacture;\n\u00b7 laboratory, preclinical and clinical testing, labeling, packaging storage and distribution;\n\u00b7 premarketing clearance or approval;\n\u00b7 record keeping;\n\u00b7 product marketing, promotion and advertising, sales and distribution; and\n\u00b7 post-marketing surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and recalls and correction and removals.\nBefore a new medical device, or a new intended use for, an existing product can be marketed in the United States, a company must first submit and receive either 510(k) clearance or premarketing approval from FDA, unless an exemption applies. Either process can be expensive, lengthy and unpredictable. We may not be able to obtain the necessary clearances or approvals or may be unduly delayed in doing so,\nwhich could harm our business. Furthermore, even if we are granted regulatory clearances or approvals, they may include significant limitations on the indicated uses for the product, which may limit the market for the product. Although we have obtained 510(k) clearance to market our Ocelot family of catheters for crossing sub and total occlusions in the peripheral vasculature, our clearance can be revoked if safety or efficacy problems develop. To market Pantheris in the United States, we must successfully complete a clinical trial, submit an application to FDA for 510(k) clearance and obtain such clearance. Therefore, even if we believe we have successfully developed Pantheris, we may not be permitted to market Pantheris in the United States if we do not obtain FDA regulatory clearance to market the product. Delays in obtaining clearance or approval could increase our costs and harm our revenues and growth.\nIn addition, we are required to timely file various reports with the FDA, including reports required by the medical device reporting regulations, or MDRs, that require that we report to the regulatory authorities if our devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. If these reports are not filed timely, regulators may impose sanctions and sales of our products may suffer, and we may be subject to product liability or regulatory enforcement actions, all of which could harm our business. For example, we have submitted to the FDA five MDRs regarding our Ocelot family of catheters, which included four for perforations and one related to removal of the guidewire coating.\nIf we initiate a correction or removal for one of our devices to reduce a risk to health posed by the device, we would be required to submit a publically available Correction and Removal report to the FDA and in many cases, similar reports to other regulatory agencies. This report could be classified by the FDA as a device recall which could lead to increased scrutiny by the FDA, other international regulatory agencies and our customers regarding the quality and safety of our devices. Furthermore, the submission of these reports has been and could be used by competitors against us in competitive situations and cause customers to delay purchase decisions or cancel orders and would harm our reputation.\nThe FDA and the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, also regulate the advertising and promotion of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, that there are adequate and reasonable data to substantiate the claims and that our promotional labeling and advertising is neither false nor misleading in any respect. If the FDA or FTC determines that any of our advertising or promotional claims are misleading, not substantiated or not permissible, we may be subject to enforcement actions, including Warning Letters, and we may be required to revise our promotional claims and make other corrections or restitutions.\nFDA and state authorities have broad enforcement powers. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by FDA or state agencies, which may include any of the following sanctions:\n\u00b7 adverse publicity, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u00b7 repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products;\n\u00b7 operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u00b7 refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products, new intended uses or modifications to existing products;\n\u00b7 withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted; and\n\u00b7 criminal prosecution.\nIf any of these events were to occur, our business and financial condition would be harmed.\nMaterial modifications to our lumivascular platform products may require new 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals or may require us to recall or cease marketing our lumivascular platform products until clearances are obtained.\nMaterial modifications to the intended use or technological characteristics of our lumivascular platform products will require new 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals or require us to recall or cease marketing the modified devices until these clearances or approvals are obtained. Based on FDA published guidelines, FDA requires device manufacturers to initially make and document a determination of whether or not a modification requires a new approval, supplement or clearance; however, FDA can review a manufacturer\u2019s decision. Any modification to an FDA-cleared device that would significantly affect its safety or efficacy or that would constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new 510(k) clearance or possibly a premarket approval. We may not be able to obtain additional 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals for new products or for modifications to, or additional indications for, our lumivascular platform products in a timely fashion, or at all. Delays in obtaining required future clearances would harm our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our future growth. We have made modifications to our lumivascular platform products in the past and will make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearances or approvals. If FDA disagrees and requires new clearances or approvals for the modifications, we may be required to recall and to stop selling or marketing our lumivascular platform products as modified, which could harm our operating results and require us to redesign our lumivascular platform products. In these circumstances, we may be subject to significant enforcement actions. We have made minor modifications and may make further modifications to the design of Pantheris prior to widespread commercialization, which could require regulatory clearances or approvals.\nIf we or our suppliers fail to comply with FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, our manufacturing operations could be delayed or shut down and lumivascular platform sales could suffer.\nOur manufacturing processes and those of our third-party suppliers are required to comply with FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, which covers the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of our lumivascular platform products. We are also subject to similar state requirements and licenses. In addition, we must engage in extensive recordkeeping and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unannounced inspections by governmental agencies, including FDA, state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries. If we fail a Quality System inspection, our operations could be disrupted and our manufacturing interrupted. Failure to take adequate corrective action in response to an adverse Quality System inspection could result in, among other things, a shut-down of our manufacturing operations, significant fines, suspension of marketing clearances and approvals, seizures or recalls of our device, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which would cause our business to suffer. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, which may result in manufacturing delays for our product and cause our revenues to decline.\nWe have registered with FDA as a medical device manufacturer and have obtained a manufacturing license from the California Department of Health Services, or CDHS. FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of CDHS to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers. Our current facility has been inspected by FDA in 2009, 2011 and 2013, and two, three and zero observations, respectively, were noted during those inspections. BSI, our European Notified Body, inspected our facility in 2013 and found zero non-conformances. We can provide no assurance that we will continue to remain in compliance with the QSR. If FDA, CDHS or BSI inspect our facility and discover compliance problems, we may have to shut down our facility and cease manufacturing until we can take the appropriate remedial steps to correct the audit findings. Taking corrective action may be expensive, time consuming and a distraction for management and if we experience a shutdown or delay at our manufacturing facility we may be unable to produce our lumivascular platform products, which would harm our business.\nOur lumivascular platform products may in the future be subject to product recalls that could harm our reputation.\nFDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material regulatory deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. A government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors or design or labeling defects. Recalls of our lumivascular platform products would divert managerial attention, be expensive, harm our reputation with customers and harm our financial condition and results of operations. A recall announcement would negatively affect our stock price.\nChanges in coverage and reimbursement for procedures using our lumivascular platform products could affect the adoption of our lumivascular platform and our future revenues.\nCurrently, our lumivascular platform procedure is typically reimbursed by third-party payors, including Medicare and private healthcare insurance companies, under existing reimbursement codes. These payors may change their coverage and reimbursement policies, as well as payment amounts, in a way that would prevent or limit reimbursement for our products, which would significantly harm our business. Also, healthcare reform legislation or regulation may be proposed or enacted in the future, which may adversely affect such policies and amounts. We cannot predict whether and to what extent existing coverage and reimbursement will continue to be available. If physicians, hospitals and other providers are unable to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement for procedures performed using our lumivascular platform products, they are significantly less likely to use our lumivascular platform products and our business would be harmed.\nHealthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent our planned products\u2019 commercial success.\nIn the United States, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system in ways that could harm our future revenues and profitability and the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers. Federal and state lawmakers regularly propose and, at times, enact legislation that would result in significant changes to the healthcare system, some of which are intended to contain or reduce the costs of medical products and services. For example, one of the most significant healthcare reform measures in decades, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or Affordable Care Act, was enacted in 2010. The Affordable Care Act contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse measures, all of which will impact existing government healthcare programs and will result in the development of new programs. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposes an excise tax of 2.3% on the sale of most medical devices, including ours, and any failure to pay this amount could result in the imposition of an injunction on the sale of our products, fines and penalties.\nIt remains unclear whether changes will be made to the Affordable Care Act. We cannot assure you that the Affordable Care Act, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not harm our business and financial results and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.\nThere likely will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at containing or lowering the cost of health care. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future or their full impact. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of health care may harm:\n\u00b7 our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products;\n\u00b7 our ability to generate revenues and achieve or maintain profitability; and\n\u00b7 the availability of capital.\nIf we fail to comply with healthcare regulations, we could face substantial penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nEven though we do not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to our business. We could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The regulations that will affect how we operate include:\n\u00b7 the federal healthcare program Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u00b7 the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false claims, or knowingly using false statements, to obtain payment from the federal government;\n\u00b7 federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u00b7 the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, created under the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, which require manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;\n\u00b7 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; and\n\u00b7 state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.\nThe Affordable Care Act, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could harm our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. In addition, the clearance or approval and commercialization of any of our products outside the United States will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations could be expensive. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could subject us to significant liability.\nOur research and development and manufacturing operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the storage, use, discharge, disposal, remediation of, and human exposure to, hazardous substances and the sale, labeling, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of products containing hazardous substances. In addition, our research and development and manufacturing operations produce biological waste materials, such as human and animal tissue, and waste solvents, such as isopropyl alcohol. These operations are permitted by regulatory authorities, and the resultant waste materials are disposed of in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Liability under environmental laws and regulations can be joint and several and without regard to fault or negligence. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive and non-compliance could result in substantial liabilities, fines and penalties, personal injury and third part property damage claims and substantial investigation and remediation costs. Environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations. We cannot assure you that violations of these laws and regulations will not occur in the future or have not occurred in the past as a result of human error, accidents, equipment failure or other causes. The expense associated with environmental regulation and remediation could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nRisks related to ownership of our common stock\nOur stock price may be volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price has fluctuated since our initial public offering and is likely to continue to fluctuate substantially. As a result of this price fluctuation, investors may experience losses on their investments in our stock. In addition, the development stage of our operations may make it difficult for investors to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the results of our clinical trials, including our VISION trial;\n\u00b7 changes in analysts\u2019 estimates, investors\u2019 perceptions, recommendations by securities analysts or our failure to achieve analysts\u2019 estimates;\n\u00b7 quarterly variations in our or our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u00b7 the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u00b7 general market conditions and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors;\n\u00b7 changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in the medical device industry in particular;\n\u00b7 the loss of key personnel, including changes in our board of directors and management;\n\u00b7 legislation or regulation of our business;\n\u00b7 lawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u00b7 the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 announcements related to patents issued to us or our competitors and to litigation; and\n\u00b7 developments in our industry.\nIn addition, the stock prices of many companies in the medical device industry have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and harm our business, results of operations, financial condition, reputation and cash flows. These factors may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, our market and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover\nus downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. If our operating results fail to meet the forecast of analysts, our stock price will likely decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We recently completed our initial public offering and a substantial number of shares will become available for sale six months thereafter. We are unable to predict the effect that these sales and others may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nOur directors, officers and principal stockholders have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders.\nAs of February 28, 2015, our directors, officers and each stockholder holding more than 5% of our common stock collectively control approximately 35.7% of our outstanding common stock, assuming the exercise of all options and warrants held by such persons. As a result, these stockholders, if they act together, would be able to exert significant influence over the management and affairs of our company and most matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control, might adversely affect the market price of our common stock and may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders.\nWe previously identified and remediated a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. We may identify additional material weaknesses in the future that may cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements of our financial statements. If we fail to remediate any material weaknesses or if we fail to establish and maintain effective control over financial reporting, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nPrior to the completion of our initial public offering, we were a private company with limited accounting personnel and other resources to address our internal control over financial reporting. During the course of preparing for our initial public offering, we determined that we had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 and 2012. The material weakness we identified related to not maintaining sufficient compliment of resources with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, experience and training commensurate with our structure and financial reporting requirements.\nFor a discussion of our remediation and the actions that we have executed during 2014 to remediate the material weakness see \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures - Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\u201d The actions we have taken are subject to continued review, supported by confirmation and testing by management as well as audit committee oversight. While we have remediated this weakness, we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies, cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The existence of a material weakness or significant deficiency could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our stock price.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market and other applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources, particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and\ninternal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. Our management and other personnel now need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns and our costs and expenses will increase, which could harm our business and operating results. We may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants to comply with these requirements, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nWe will incur additional compensation costs in the event that we decide to pay our executive officers cash compensation closer to that of executive officers of other public medical device companies, which would increase our general and administrative expense and could harm our profitability. Any future equity awards will also increase our compensation expense. We also expect that being a public company and compliance with applicable rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executive officers and members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee.\nAs a result of disclosure of information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which could be advantageous to our competitors and clients and could result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be harmed, and even if the claims are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and harm our business and operating results.\nWe are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We will remain eligible for these exemptions, other than with respect to stockholder approval of golden parachute payments, after we are no longer an emerging growth company for as long as we remain a smaller reporting company. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile or decline.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non- affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may suffer or be more volatile.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law could discourage a takeover.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended and restated, contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover. These provisions include:\n\u00b7 a classified board of directors;\n\u00b7 advance notice requirements applicable to stockholders for matters to be brought before a meeting of stockholders and requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder\u2019s notice;\n\u00b7 a supermajority stockholder vote requirement for amending certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u00b7 the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer;\n\u00b7 allowing stockholders to remove directors only for cause;\n\u00b7 a requirement that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors;\n\u00b7 allowing all vacancies, including newly created directorships, to be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum, except as otherwise required by law;\n\u00b7 a requirement that our stockholders may only take action at annual or special meetings of our stockholders and not by written consent;\n\u00b7 limiting the forum for certain litigation against us to Delaware; and\n\u00b7 limiting the persons that can call special meetings of our stockholders to our board of directors, the chairperson of our board of directors, the chief executive officer or the president (in the absence of a chief executive officer).\nThese provisions might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or a change in our management. The existence of these provisions could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or to our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws (iv) any action to interpret apply, enforce or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or (v) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future, and any return on investment may be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, prospects and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our credit agreement prohibits us from, among other things, paying any dividends or making any other distribution or payment on account of our common stock. If we do not pay dividends, our stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if you sell our common stock after our stock price appreciates.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be maintained.\nOur stock is currently approved for quotation on the NASDAQ Stock Market, but we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain an active trading market on NASDAQ or any other exchange in the future. If an active market for our common stock is not maintained, it may be difficult for our stockholders to sell shares without depressing the market price for the shares or at all.", "PERMNO": 15172, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "AVGR"}
