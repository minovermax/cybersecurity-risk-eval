{"cik": "1016504", "company": "INTEGRATED BIOPHARMA INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-09-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nPlease carefully consider the following risk factors which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. The risk factors described below are not the only ones we face. Risks and uncertainties not known to us currently, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur revenue could decline significantly if we lose one or more of our most significant customers, which could have a significant adverse impact on us.\nA significant portion of our revenues are concentrated among four customers, Life Extension, Herbalife (customers in our Contract Manufacturing Segment), and Thermosource Tooling and Manufacturing and ThermoFisher Scientific, (customers of our Other Nutraceutical Businesses Segment). In the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, approximately 90% and 92% of our consolidated net sales, respectively, were derived from the two major customers in our Contract Manufacturing Segment. The loss of any of these customers could have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSupply chain disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and other geo-political events could have an impact on our financial results and ability to timely ship products to our customers.\nWe are still experiencing supply chain disruptions relating to fuel refinery and transportation issues as it pertains to both shipping and production of plastics. These issues first arose as result of the COVID-19 pandemic and other geo-political events. This continues to impact the supply and demand of bottles and caps, key components in our Contract Manufacturing Segment. Transportation, in general, continues to be an issue in the delay of receiving other raw materials and our ability to meet promised delivery dates to our customers in the Contract Manufacturing Segment\nAdditionally, the significant outbreak of this contagious disease in the human population has resulted in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for the Company\u2019s products and impact our operating results.\nWhile we haven\u2019t, to date, seen a significant negative impact in our margins resulting from the coronavirus outbreak, we are experiencing a slight negative impact on our margins due to inflation and tightened labor markets.\nDuring the first quarter of calendar 2022, the war in Ukraine affected our customer\u2019s business operations in Ukraine and Russia, resulting in the cancelation of some future orders. The war resulted in the imposition of sanctions by the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union that affect the cross-border operations of businesses operating in Russia. In addition, many multinational companies ceased or suspended their operations in Russia. Therefore, the ability to continue operations in Russia by our customers is uncertain. Also, there may be a shortage of Sunflower Oil products in the near future and this may cause delays in production of certain raw materials and may require reformulation of products.\nAdditionally, unrelated to the war, a recent export ban of palm oil products from Indonesia may play a role in the reformulation of many products. This may cause delays in finished products as these items will need to be reformulated and labels updated and printed with the changes, which may cause further delays.\nWe have indebtedness, which may decrease our flexibility, increase our borrowing costs and adversely affect our liquidity.\nWe currently have an $11.6 million in senior secured financing ( the \u201cSenior Credit Facility\u201d) under the Loan Agreement, dated as of June 27, 2012 and as amended on May 15, 2019 (the \"Amended Loan Agreement\"), by and among the Company, MDC, AgroLabs, IHT Health Products, Inc., IHT Properties Corp. (\u201cIHT Properties\u201d), and Vitamin Factory (collectively, the \u201cBorrowers\u201d) and PNC Bank, National Association (\"PNC\") and $2.6 million in operating lease obligations. As of June 30, 2022, we have an aggregate of $0.1 million outstanding with PNC under the Senior Credit Facility.\nOur level of indebtedness can have important consequences. For example, it may require a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness and reduce our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate requirements or to pay dividends; and limit our flexibility to adjust to changing business and market conditions and make us more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions as compared to our competitors.\nThere are various financial covenants and other restrictions in the Senior Credit Facility. If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness (and other unrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity. A default under the Senior Credit Facility may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing. For example, PNC's ongoing obligation to extend credit under the Amended Loan Agreement is dependent upon our compliance with these covenants and restrictions.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Our inability to refinance our indebtedness when necessary or to do so upon attractive terms would materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ongoing results of operations.\nComplying with new and existing government regulation, both in the U.S. and abroad, could increase our costs significantly and adversely affect our financial results.\nThe processing, formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution and sale of our products are subject to regulation by several U.S. federal agencies, including the FDA, the FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Department of Agriculture and the EPA, as well as various state, local and international laws and agencies of the localities in which our products are sold. Government regulations may prevent or delay the introduction, or require the reformulation, of our products. Some agencies, such as the FDA or state agencies, could require us to remove a particular product from the market, delay or prevent the import of raw materials for the manufacture of our products, or otherwise disrupt the marketing of our products. Any such government actions would result in additional costs to us, including lost revenues from any additional products that we are required to remove from the market, which additional costs could be material. Any such government actions also could lead to liability, substantial costs and reduced growth prospects. Moreover, there can be no assurance that new laws or regulations imposing more stringent regulatory requirements on the dietary supplement industry will not be enacted or issued. In addition, complying with adverse event reporting requirements imposes additional costs on us, which costs could become significant in the event more demanding reporting requirements are put into place.\nAdditional or more stringent regulations of dietary supplements and other products have been considered from time to time. These developments could require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of certain products that cannot be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of certain products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, adverse event reporting or other new requirements. These developments also could increase our costs significantly. For example, the FDA issued rules which became effective in 2008 that imposed substantial new regulatory requirements for dietary supplements, including GMPs. Congress also passed legislation requiring adverse event reporting and related record keeping which imposed additional costs on us. See Item 1. \"Description of Business-Government Regulations\" for additional information.\nWe may be exposed to or the target of legal proceedings initiated by regulators or third parties either in the United States or abroad which could increase our costs and adversely affect our reputation, revenues and operating income.\nIn the United States and abroad, non-compliance with relevant legislation can result in regulators bringing administrative or, in some cases, criminal proceedings. As manufacturers of nutraceutical products, our products are regulated by various governments and it is common for regulators to prosecute retailers and manufacturers for non-compliance with legislation governing foodstuffs and medicines. Failures by us or our subsidiaries to comply with applicable legislation could occur from time to time and prosecution for any such violations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, we are subject, from time to time, to claims by third parties under various legal theories. The defense of such claims, or any adverse outcome relating to any such claims, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe depend on our senior management, the loss of whom would have an adverse effect on us.\nWe presently are dependent upon the executive abilities of our Executive Chairman of the Board and President, E. Gerald Kay, our Co-Chief Executive Officers, Christina Kay and Riva Sheppard, and our Chief Financial Officer, Dina L. Masi. Our business and operations to date chiefly have been implemented under the direction of these individuals, who presently are, and in the future will be, responsible for the implementation of our anticipated plans and programs. The loss or unavailability of the services of one or more of our principal executives would have an adverse effect on us. We may encounter difficulty in our ability to recruit and ultimately hire any replacement or additional executive officers having similar background, experience and qualifications as those of our current executive officers.\nThere is no assurance that we will remain quoted or listed on an active trading market.\nAs of January 22, 2021, the Company\u2019s common stock was upgraded to the OTCQX\u00ae Best Market of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. and commenced quotation under the symbol \u201cINBP.\u201d In order to maintain quotation on the OTCQX, the Company will be required to comply with certain minimum qualitative and quantitative requirements, including with respect to corporate governance. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to comply with these qualitative and quantitative requirements for continued quotation of its common stock on the OTCQX. If the Company doesn\u2019t maintain compliance with the OTCQX rules, the Company\u2019s common stock may resume listing on the OTCQB and holders of the Company\u2019s common stock may find it more difficult to sell their shares.\nFrom September 23, 2009 until January 21, 2021, our common stock was quoted on the OTQB. From February 27, 2009 through September 22, 2009, our common stock was quoted on the Pink Sheets. Prior to February 27, 2009, our common stock was listed on the NASDAQ Global Market, and there can be no assurance that we will, in the future, be able to meet all the requirements for reinstatement on that or any other national securities exchange. The delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ Global Market has adversely affected, and may in the future continue to adversely affect, the liquidity and trading of our common stock.\nWe have entered into several transactions with entities controlled by some of our officers and directors, which could pose a conflict of interest.\nWe have several agreements and arrangements, described in our previous SEC filings and to be described in our proxy statement for our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, including the lease of real property from Vitamin Realty Associates, L.L.C. (\u201cVitamin Realty\u201d), the sale of our financial debt securities, and issuance of our common stock, which involved transactions with entities owned, in whole or in part, by members of the family of our Executive Chairman and our Co-Chief Executive Officers and other of our significant shareholders and/or directors, who collectively own a majority of our shares of common stock. Although we believe that these transactions were advantageous to us and were on terms no less favorable to us than could have been obtained from unaffiliated third parties, transactions with related parties can potentially pose a conflict of interest.\nOur Executive Officers and Directors have majority voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interest of other stockholders, but in their own interest.\nCollectively, our Executive Officers, Directors and one other significant stockholder, beneficially own approximately 73% of our outstanding shares of common stock as of September 13, 2022. If these stockholders act together, they would be able to exert significant control over our management and affairs since significant corporate transactions require stockholder approval. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control and might adversely affect the market price of our common stock. This concentration of ownership may not be in the best interests of all our stockholders.\nWe have a staggered Board of Directors, which could impede an attempt to acquire the Company or remove our management.\nOur Board of Directors is divided into three classes, each of which serves for a staggered term of three years. This division of our Board of Directors could have the effect of impeding an attempt to take over our company or change or remove management, since only one class will be elected annually. Thus, only approximately one-third of the existing Board of Directors could be replaced at any election of directors.\nOur product liability insurance may be insufficient to cover possible claims against us.\nOur company, like other manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors of vitamin and nutritional supplement products, faces an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims if, among other things, the use or ingestion of our products, results in sickness or injury. We currently maintain a product liability insurance policy that provides a total of $5.0 million of coverage per occurrence and $5.0 million of coverage in the aggregate. However, there can be no assurance that existing or future insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover any possible product liability risks or that such insurance will continue to be available to us on economically feasible terms.\nOur nutraceutical products are manufactured using various raw materials consisting of vitamins, minerals, herbs, fruit extracts and other ingredients that we regard as safe when taken as recommended by us and that various scientific studies have suggested may provide health benefits. We could be adversely affected if any of our products or any similar products distributed by other companies should prove or be asserted to be harmful to consumers or should scientific studies provide unfavorable findings regarding the effectiveness of our products.\nWe may not be able to obtain raw materials used in certain of our manufactured products.\nThe principal raw materials used in the manufacturing process in the Company\u2019s nutraceutical business are natural and synthetic vitamins, minerals, herbs, related nutritional supplements, vegetable and gelatin capsules, coating materials, fruit extracts, fruit juices and the necessary components for packaging the finished products. The raw materials are available from numerous sources within the United States and abroad. The vegetable and gelatin capsules, coating materials and packaging materials are similarly widely available. We generally purchase our raw materials, on a purchase order basis, without long-term commitments.\nWe have one principal supplier for our Other Nutraceutical Businesses Segment, DSM Nutritional Products LLC and several suppliers in our Contract Manufacturing Segment. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with our suppliers, we may not be able to find alternate sourcing of our raw materials or at the same pricing that we receive from our current suppliers and/or quickly enough to make timely shipments to our customers. This could decrease our sales and/or increase our cost of sales.\nCurrent economic conditions may cause a decline in business and consumer spending which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nOur operating results are impacted by the health of the North American economies. Our business and financial performance, including collection of our accounts receivable, recoverability of assets including investments, may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions, such as a reduction in the availability of credit, financial market volatility, recession, etc. Additionally, we may experience difficulties in scaling our operations to react to economic pressures in the United States.\nWe may incur significant professional service fees and other control costs that impact our financial condition.\nAs a publicly traded corporation, we incur certain costs to comply with regulatory requirements. If regulatory requirements were to become more stringent or if controls thought to be effective later fail, we may be forced to make additional expenditures, the amounts of which could be material. Some of our competitors are privately owned so their accounting and control costs can be a competitive disadvantage for us. Should our sales decline or if we are unsuccessful at increasing prices to cover higher expenditures for internal controls, audits, consultants and legal, our costs associated with regulatory compliance will rise as a percentage of sales.\nOther issues and uncertainties may include:\n\u25cf New accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting policies; and\n\u25cf Legislation or other governmental action that detrimentally impacts our expenses or reduces sales by adversely affecting our customers.\nIf we discover material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult.\nIf we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, related to disclosure controls and procedures, or if we discover material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in helping prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly. While we have not identified any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we cannot be certain that material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls will not be discovered in the future.\nWe have not paid dividends on our common stock in the past and do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We expect that any income received from operations will be devoted to our future operations and growth. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. Payment of dividends would depend upon our profitability at the time, cash available for those dividends, and other factors that our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on an investor\u2019s investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates. Investors in our common stock should not rely on an investment in our company if they require dividend income.\nA sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline and may impair our ability to raise capital in the future.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTCQX\u00ae Best Market and could be considered \u201cthinly-traded,\u201d meaning that the number of investors interested in purchasing our common stock at or near bid prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. Finance transactions resulting in a large amount of newly issued shares that become readily tradable, or other events that cause current stockholders to sell shares, could place downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, the lack of a robust resale market may require a stockholder who desires to sell a large number of shares of common stock to sell the shares in increments over time to mitigate any adverse impact of the sales on the market price of our stock.\nIf our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders may sell for various reasons, including the ending of restriction on resale, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, the market price of our common stock could fall. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.", "PERMNO": 84067, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "INBP"}
