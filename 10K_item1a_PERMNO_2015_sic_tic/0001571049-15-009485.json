{"cik": "1014507", "company": "SIRONA DENTAL SYSTEMS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-11-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nINTRODUCTION\nThese risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A), and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference in this report.\nOur businesses routinely encounter and address risks, some of which will cause our future results to be different - sometimes materially different - than we anticipate. Discussion about the material operational risks that our businesses encounter can be found in our MD&A, in the business descriptions in Item 1 of this report and in previous SEC filings. Below, we have described our present view of the material risks facing our business.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe must continue to develop new products and adapt to rapid technological change and evolving industry standards to remain competitive.\nWe are currently developing new products and enhancements to existing products. We cannot assure you that we will initiate, continue with and/or succeed in our efforts to develop or enhance such products. There can be no assurance that any new products will be developed by us, or if developed, will be approved by, or receive marketing clearance from, applicable domestic and/or international governmental or regulatory authorities.\nThe market for our products is characterized by rapid and significant technological change, evolving industry standards and new product introductions. Our products require significant planning, design, development and testing which requires significant capital commitments and investment by us. There can be no assurance that our products or proprietary technologies will not become noncompetitive or obsolete as a result of technological change, evolving industry standards or new product introductions or that we will be able to generate any economic return on our investment in product development. If our products or technologies become noncompetitive or obsolete, our business could be negatively affected.\nIf we cannot obtain or maintain approval from government agencies, we will not be able to sell our products.\nWe must obtain certain approvals by, and marketing clearances from, governmental authorities, including the FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries to market and sell our products in those countries. These regulatory agencies regulate the marketing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, advertising, sale and distribution of medical devices. The FDA enforces additional regulations regarding the safety of X-ray emitting devices. Our products are currently regulated by such authorities and certain of our new products will require approval by, or marketing clearance from, various governmental authorities, including the FDA. Various states also impose similar regulations.\nSIRONA DENTAL SYSTEMS, INC.\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\nFORM 10-K\nFOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015\nThe FDA review process typically requires extended proceedings pertaining to the safety and efficacy of new products. A 510(k) application is required in order to market a new or modified medical device. If specifically required by the FDA, a pre-market approval, or PMA, may be necessary. Such proceedings, which must be completed prior to marketing a new medical device, are potentially expensive and time consuming. They may delay or hinder a product\u2019s timely entry into the marketplace. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the review or approval process for these products by the FDA or any other applicable governmental authority will occur in a timely fashion, if at all, or that additional regulations will not be adopted or current regulations amended in such a manner as will adversely affect us. The FDA also oversees the content of advertising and marketing materials relating to medical devices which have received FDA clearance. Failure to comply with the FDA\u2019s advertising guidelines may result in the imposition of penalties.\nWe are also subject to other federal, state and local laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices. The extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSimilar to the FDA review process, the EU review process typically requires extended proceedings pertaining to the safety and efficacy of new products. Such proceedings, which must be completed prior to marketing a new medical device, are potentially expensive and time consuming and may delay or prevent a product\u2019s entry into the marketplace.\nOur profitability may be negatively impacted by adverse general macroeconomic conditions in the geographic markets in which we sell our products.\nOur profitability depends in part on the varying economic and other conditions of the global dental market, which in turn is impacted by general macroeconomic conditions in the geographic markets in which we sell our products. Growth in the global dental market over the past few years has been driven by a number of factors, including a growth in disposable income, a shift towards private pay, a greater need for dental preventative care and an increased emphasis on aesthetics. Demand for our products would be negatively impacted by a decline in the economy in general, including interest rate and tax changes, that impact the financial strength of our customers, as well as by changes in the economy in general that reduce disposable income among dental consumers in the markets we sell our products, which would in turn reduce the demand for preventative and aesthetic dental services.\nThe ongoing disruptions in the overall world economy and financial markets could reduce disposable income among dental consumers and negatively affect the demand for dental services, which could be harmful to our financial position and results of operations. Furthermore, there can be no assurances that government responses to the disruptions in the financial markets will stabilize the markets or increase liquidity and the availability of credit for our customers. Difficult economic conditions may also result in a higher rate of losses on our accounts receivable. As a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are dependent upon a limited number of distributors for a significant portion of our revenue, and loss of these key distributors could result in a loss of a significant amount of our revenue.\nHistorically, a substantial portion of our revenue has come from a limited number of distributors. For example, Patterson Dental Company, Inc. accounted for 33% of revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. In addition, 14% of our revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, was attributable to sales to Henry Schein, Inc. It is anticipated that Patterson and Henry Schein will continue to be the largest contributors to our revenue for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurance that Patterson and Henry Schein will purchase any specified minimum quantity of products from us or that they will continue to purchase any products at all. If Patterson or Henry Schein ceases to purchase a significant volume of products from us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nSIRONA DENTAL SYSTEMS, INC.\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\nFORM 10-K\nFOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015\nCompetition in the markets for our products is intense, and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nCompetition relating to our current products is intense and includes various companies, both within and outside of the United States. We anticipate that competition for our future products will also be intense and include various companies, both within and outside of the United States, Asia and Europe. Our competitors and potential competitors include large companies with substantially greater financial, sales and marketing, and technical resources, larger and more experienced research and development staffs, more extensive physical facilities and substantially greater experience in obtaining regulatory approvals and in marketing products than we have. In addition, we cannot assure you that our competitors are not currently developing, or will not attempt to develop, technologies and products that are more effective than those being developed by us or that would otherwise render our existing and new technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive. We may not be able to compete successfully and may lose market share to our competitors.\nOur failure to obtain issued patents and, consequently, to protect our proprietary technology could hurt our competitive position.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and enforce claims in our patents directed to our products, technologies and processes, both in the United States and in other countries. Risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our patents and patent applications include the following:\n\u00b7 the pending patent applications that we have filed, or to which we have exclusive rights, may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents;\n\u00b7 the allowed claims of any patents that issue may not provide meaningful protection;\n\u00b7 we may be unable to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u00b7 the patents licensed or issued to us may not provide a competitive advantage;\n\u00b7 other companies may challenge patents licensed or issued to us;\n\u00b7 disputes may arise regarding inventions and corresponding ownership rights in inventions\nand know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by us and our respective licensors; and\n\u00b7 other companies may design around the technologies patented by us.\nOur revenue and operating results are likely to fluctuate.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results have varied in the past, and our operating results are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future. These variations result from a number of factors, many of which are substantially outside of our control, including:\n\u00b7 the timing of new product introductions by us and our competitors;\n\u00b7 timing of industry tradeshows, particularly the International Dental Show;\n\u00b7 changes in relationships with distributors;\n\u00b7 the timing of operational decisions by distributors and end users;\n\u00b7 developments in government reimbursement policies;\n\u00b7 changes in product mix;\n\u00b7 our ability to supply products to meet customer demand;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in manufacturing costs;\n\u00b7 tax incentives;\n\u00b7 currency fluctuations; and\n\u00b7 general economic conditions, as well as those specific to the healthcare industry and related industries.\nSIRONA DENTAL SYSTEMS, INC.\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\nFORM 10-K\nFOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe are exposed to currency exchange risk with respect to the U.S. Dollar in relation to the Euro, because a large portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in Euros. In addition, we have an increasing portion of revenue and expenses denominated in other foreign currencies, e.g. Yen, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, and Yuan Renminbi. We monitor changes in our exposure to exchange rate risk. While we enter into hedging arrangements to protect our business against certain currency fluctuations, these hedging arrangements do not provide comprehensive protection, and our results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected by foreign exchange fluctuations.\nOur hedging and cash management transactions may expose us to loss or limit our potential gains.\nAs part of our risk management program, we use foreign currency exchange forward contracts. While intended to reduce the effects of exchange rate fluctuations, these transactions may limit our potential gains or expose us to loss. Should our counterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which these transactions are offered fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress or otherwise, we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from these transactions.\nWe enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of trade commitments or anticipated commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to mitigate the effects of changes in currency rates. Although we do not enter into these instruments for trading purposes or speculation, and although our management believes all of these instruments are economically effective as hedges of underlying physical transactions, these foreign exchange commitments are dependent on timely performance by our counterparties. Their failure to perform could result in our having to close these hedges without the anticipated underlying transaction and could result in losses if foreign currency exchange rates have changed.\nWe enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time to manage some of our exposure to interest rate volatility. These swap agreements involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements. In addition, these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to changes in interest rates. If such events occur, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nMost of our cash deposited with banks is not insured and would be subject to the risk of bank failure. Our total liquidity also depends in part on the availability of funds under our Senior Facility Agreement. The failure of any bank in which we deposit our funds or that is part of our Senior Facility Agreement could reduce the amount of cash we have available for operations and additional investments in our business.\nIf we lose our key management personnel or are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, it could adversely affect our results of operations or delay or hurt our research and product development efforts.\nOur success is dependent, in part, upon our ability to hire and retain management, sales, technical, research and other personnel who are in high demand and are often subject to competing employment opportunities. It is possible that the loss of the services of one or a combination of our senior executives or key managers could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nWork stoppages and other labor relations matters may make it substantially more difficult or expensive for us to produce our products, which could result in decreased sales or increased costs, either of which would negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant part of our foreign employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements, and some of our employees are unionized; therefore, we are subject to the risk of work stoppages and other labor relations matters. While we have not experienced prolonged work stoppages in recent years and believe our relations with employees are satisfactory, any prolonged work stoppage or strike at any one of our principal facilities could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nSIRONA DENTAL SYSTEMS, INC.\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\nFORM 10-K\nFOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015\nWe may experience difficulties managing our growth, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIt is expected that we will grow in certain areas of our operations as we develop and, assuming receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals, market our products. We will therefore need to recruit personnel, particularly sales and marketing personnel, and expand our capabilities, which may strain our managerial, operational, financial and other resources. To compete effectively and manage our growth, we must:\n\u00b7 train, manage, motivate and retain a growing employee base;\n\u00b7 accurately forecast demand for, and revenue from, our product candidates; and\n\u00b7 expand existing operational, financial and management information systems to support our development and planned commercialization activities and the multiple locations of our offices.\nOur failure to manage these challenges effectively could materially harm our business.\nSince we operate in markets outside of the United States and Europe, we are subject to additional risks.\nWe anticipate that sales outside of the United States and Europe will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenue. Such revenue is subject to a number of uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 economic and political instability;\n\u00b7 import or export licensing requirements;\n\u00b7 trade restrictions;\n\u00b7 longer payment cycles;\n\u00b7 unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs;\n\u00b7 fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7 potentially adverse tax consequences; and\n\u00b7 potentially weak protection of intellectual property rights.\nThese risks may impair our ability to generate revenue from our sales efforts. In addition, many countries outside of the United States and Europe have their own regulatory approval requirements for the sale of products. As a result, the introduction of new products into, and our continued sale of existing products in, these markets could be prevented, and/or costly and/or time-consuming, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all.\nOur business is subject to extensive, complex, and changing laws, regulations, and orders that failure to comply with could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities.\nWe are subject to extensive laws, regulations, and orders which are administered by various international, federal, and state governmental authorities, including, among others, the FDA, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury (\"OFAC\"), the United States Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of Justice, and other similar domestic and foreign authorities. These regulations include, but are not limited to, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar international anti-bribery laws, regulations concerning the supply of conflict minerals, various environmental regulations and regulations relating to trade, import and export controls and economic sanctions. Such laws, regulations, and orders may be complex and are subject to change.\nCompliance with the numerous applicable existing and new laws, regulations and orders could require us to incur substantial regulatory compliance costs. Although the Company has implemented policies and procedures to comply with applicable laws, regulations and orders, there can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not raise compliance concerns or perform audits to confirm compliance with such laws, regulations, and orders. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, or orders could result in a range of governmental enforcement actions, including fines or penalties, injunctions, and/or criminal or other civil proceedings. Any such actions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated revenue and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nSIRONA DENTAL SYSTEMS, INC.\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\nFORM 10-K\nFOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and any determination that we violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nTo the extent that we operate outside the United States, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. In particular, we may be held liable for actions taken by our strategic or local partners even though such partners are foreign companies that are not subject to the FCPA. Any determination that we violated the FCPA could result in sanctions that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions designed to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012 the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. There are additional costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. The implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply, and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict-free minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement.\nWe may be a party to legal actions that are not covered by insurance.\nWe may be a party to a variety of legal actions, such as employment and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims, stockholder suits, including securities fraud, governmental investigations and intellectual property related litigation. In addition, because of the nature of our business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations. Although we have maintained insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities, we cannot assure you that such insurance coverage will continue to be available or, if available, that it can be obtained in sufficient amounts or at reasonable cost or that it will be sufficient to cover any claims that may arise. Other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage, or the amount of insurance may not be sufficient to cover the damages awarded. In addition, certain types of damages, such as punitive damages, may not be covered by insurance and/or insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future.\nWe are dependent upon a limited number of suppliers for critical components. If these suppliers delay or discontinue the manufacture of these components, we may experience delays in shipments, increased costs and cancellation of orders for our products.\nWe rely on key suppliers for various critical components and procure certain components from outside sources which are sole suppliers. The availability and prices of these components may be subject to change due to interruptions in production, changing market conditions and other events. Any delays in delivery of or shortages in these components could interrupt and delay manufacturing of our products and result in the cancellation of orders for our products. In addition, these suppliers could discontinue the manufacture or supply of these components at any time. We may not be able to identify and integrate alternative sources of supply in a timely fashion or at all. Any transition to alternate suppliers may result in delays in shipment and increased expenses and may limit our ability to deliver products to our customers. If we are unable to develop reasonably-priced alternative sources in a timely manner, or if we encounter delays or other difficulties in the supply of such products and other materials from third parties, our business and results of operations may be harmed. In past years, semiconductors have been subject to significant price fluctuations.\nSIRONA DENTAL SYSTEMS, INC.\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\nFORM 10-K\nFOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015\nWhile we have, in the past, attempted to mitigate the effects of such potential fluctuations, we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so or that we will be able to successfully mitigate the effect of future price increases on our results of operations and financial condition. See Item 1 Business - Manufacturing and Suppliers.\nOur profitability could suffer if third parties infringe upon our proprietary technology.\nOur profitability could suffer if third parties infringe upon our intellectual property rights or misappropriate our technologies and trademarks for their own businesses. To protect our rights to our intellectual property, we rely on a combination of patent and trademark law, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements and contractual arrangements with our employees, strategic partners and others. We cannot assure you that any of our patents, any of the patents of which we are a licensee or any patents which may be issued to us or which we may license in the future, will provide us with a competitive advantage or afford us protection against infringement by others, or that the patents will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by third parties, including our competitors. The protective steps we have taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information. We may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. Effective patent, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which we will offer, or intend to offer, our products. Any failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could devalue our proprietary content and impair our ability to compete effectively. Further, defending our intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.\nOur profitability may suffer if our products are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others.\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or to defend against any claims of infringement of patents owned by third parties that are asserted against us. In addition, we may have to participate in one or more interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office or other foreign patent governing authorities, to determine the priority of inventions, which could result in substantial costs.\nIf we become involved in litigation or interference proceedings, we may incur substantial expense, and the proceedings may divert the attention of our technical and management personnel, even if we ultimately prevail. An adverse determination in proceedings of this type could subject us to significant liabilities, allow our competitors to market competitive products without obtaining a license from us, prohibit us from marketing our products or require us to seek licenses from third parties that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we cannot obtain such licenses, we may be restricted or prevented from commercializing our products.\nThe enforcement, defense and prosecution of intellectual property rights, including the United States Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s, the European Patent Office\u2019s and other foreign patent offices\u2019 interference proceedings, and related legal and administrative proceedings in the United States and elsewhere, involve complex legal and factual questions. As a result, these proceedings are costly and time-consuming, and their outcome is uncertain. Litigation may be necessary to:\n\u00b7 assert against others or defend us against claims of infringement;\n\u00b7 enforce patents owned by, or licensed to us from, another party;\n\u00b7 protect our trade secrets or know-how; or\n\u00b7 determine the enforceability, scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights\nof others.\nChanges in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business.\nThe healthcare industry has undergone, and is in the process of undergoing, significant changes driven by efforts to reduce costs. These changes include legislative healthcare reform, the reduction of spending budgets by government and private insurance programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid and corporate health insurance plans; trends toward managed care; consolidation of healthcare distribution companies; consolidation of healthcare manufacturers; collective purchasing arrangements and consolidation among office-based healthcare practitioners; and changes in reimbursements to customers. Some of these potential changes may cause a decrease in demand for and/or reduce the prices of our products. These changes could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. In addition, similar legislative efforts in the future could adversely impact our business.\nSIRONA DENTAL SYSTEMS, INC.\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\nFORM 10-K\nFOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015\nThe implementation of the Health Care Reform Law could adversely affect our business.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, each enacted in March 2010, generally known as the Health Care Reform Law, significantly expand health insurance coverage to uninsured Americans and changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private payers. We expect expansion of access to health insurance to increase the demand for our products and services, but other provisions of the Health Care Reform Law could affect us adversely. Additionally, further federal and state proposals for health care reform are likely. We cannot predict what further reform proposals, if any, will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us.\nThe Health Care Reform Law contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and to reduce costs of Medicare and Medicaid, including imposing a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013, which may adversely affect sales and cost of goods sold.\nThe implementation of the reporting and disclosure obligations of the Physician Payment Sunshine Act provisions of the Health Care Reform Law could adversely affect our business.\nA Health Care Reform Law provision, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act or Open Payments Program, has imposed new reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals), and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity. On February 1, 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) released the final rule to implement the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. We published our first disclosure report in March 2015. As required under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, CMS will publish information from these reports on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and physician, dentist and teaching hospital identities.\nThe final rule implementing the Physician Payment Sunshine Act is complex, ambiguous, and broad in scope. CMS commentary on the final rule and more recent CMS communications indicate that wholesale drug and device distributors which take title to such products are to be treated as \u201capplicable manufacturers\u201d subject to full reporting requirements. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries manufacture devices. Accordingly, we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with dentists and teaching hospitals. The Physician Payment Sunshine Act preempts similar state reporting laws, although we or our subsidiaries may be required to continue to report under certain of such state laws. While we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the Physician Payment Sunshine Act requirements, our compliance with the final rule imposes additional costs on us.\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to federal and state (and similar foreign) laws and regulations relating to health care fraud. Some of these laws, referred to as \u201cfalse claims laws,\u201d prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payers and programs. Other laws, referred to as \u201canti-kickback laws,\u201d prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing, of items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs.\nSIRONA DENTAL SYSTEMS, INC.\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\nFORM 10-K\nFOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015\nThe government has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other. As a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance. In addition, under the reporting and disclosure obligations of the Physician Payment Sunshine Act provisions of the Health Care Reform Law, the general public and government officials will be provided with new access to detailed information with regard to payments or other transfers of value to certain practitioners (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals) by applicable drug and device manufacturers subject to such reporting and disclosure obligations, which includes us. This information may lead to greater scrutiny, which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs.\nFailure to comply with health care fraud laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse impact on our business. Also, these laws may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses. Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs. In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial, regulatory authorities, increasing compliance risks.\nWhile we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder, and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response, could adversely affect our business.\nIf we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to the confidentiality of sensitive personal information or standards in electronic health data transmissions, we could be required to make significant changes to our products, or incur penalties or other liabilities.\nCertain of our businesses involve access to personal health, medical, financial and other information of individuals, and are accordingly directly or indirectly subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information, and require, among other things, the implementation of various recordkeeping, operational, notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information, limit its use to allowed purposes, and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches. Failure to comply with these laws can result in substantial penalties and other liabilities. As a result of the federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH Act\u201d), which was passed in 2009, some of our businesses that were previously only indirectly subject to federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d) privacy and security rules became directly subject to such rules because such businesses serve as \u201cbusiness associates\u201d of HIPAA covered entities, such as health care providers. On January 17, 2013 the Office for Civil Rights of the Department of Health and Human Services released a final rule implementing the HITECH Act and making certain other changes to HIPAA privacy and security requirements. Compliance with the rule was required by September 23, 2013, and increases the requirements applicable to some of our businesses.\nIn addition, our affiliates handle personally identifiable information pertaining to our members and paying subscribers. Both we and our affiliates are subject to laws and regulations related to Internet communications (including the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003), consumer protection (including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and similar state laws), advertising, privacy, security and data protection. If we or our affiliates are found to be in violation of these laws and regulations, we may become subject to administrative fines or litigation, which could materially increase our expenses and cause the value of our securities to decline.\nProduct liability claims exposure could be significant.\nWe may face exposure to product liability claims and recalls for unforeseen reasons from consumers, distributors or others. We may experience material product liability losses in the future, and we may incur significant costs to defend these claims. In addition, if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective; we may be required to participate in a recall involving those products. End-users of our products may look to us for contribution when faced with product recalls or product liability claims. Although we have maintained insurance coverage related to product liability claims, we cannot assure you that product liability insurance coverage will continue to be available or, if available, that it can be obtained in sufficient amounts or at reasonable cost or that it will be sufficient to cover any claims that may arise. We may not maintain any insurance relating to potential recalls of our products. A successful product liability claim brought against us in excess of available insurance coverage or a requirement to participate in any product recall could reduce our profits and/or impair our financial condition, and damage our reputation.\nSIRONA DENTAL SYSTEMS, INC.\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\nFORM 10-K\nFOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015\nProduct warranty claims exposure could be significant.\nWe generally warrant each of our products against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one year from the date of shipment plus any extended warranty period purchased by the customer. The future costs associated with providing product warranties could be material. A successful warranty claim brought against us could reduce our profits and/or impair our financial condition, and damage our reputation.\nAdverse publicity regarding the safety of our technology or products could negatively impact us.\nDespite any favorable safety tests that may be completed with respect to our products, adverse publicity regarding application of X-ray products or other products being developed or marketed by others could negatively affect us. If other researchers\u2019 studies raise or substantiate concerns over the safety of our technology approach or product development efforts generally, our reputation could be harmed, which would adversely impact our business.\nInadequate levels of reimbursement from governmental or other third-party payers for procedures using our products may cause our revenue to decline.\nThird-party payers, including government health administration authorities, private health care insurers and other organizations regulate the reimbursement of fees related to certain diagnostic procedures or medical treatments. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. While we cannot predict what effect the policies of government entities and other third-party payers will have on future sales of our products, there can be no assurance that such policies would not cause our revenue to decline.\nWe have developed and must continue to maintain internal controls.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and effectively prevent fraud, our operating results could be harmed. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to furnish a report by management on internal control over financial reporting, including managements\u2019 assessment of the effectiveness of such control. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its certain limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. As a result, even effective internal controls may not provide reasonable assurances with respect to the preparation and presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become either obsolete or inadequate as a result of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in implementing new or revised controls, our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our reporting obligations.\nWe may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired.\nOur balance sheet includes goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. If impairment of our goodwill or other identifiable intangible assets is determined, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in the period of such determination under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\nCompliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure will result in additional expenses and pose challenges for our management\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC regulations, have created uncertainty for public companies and significantly increased the costs and risks associated with accessing the U.S. public markets. Our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards for public companies, which will lead to increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities.\nWe Are Subject to Payments-Related Risks\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts, direct debit from a customer\u2019s bank account, consumer invoicing, physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card issuing banks\u2019 costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nSIRONA DENTAL SYSTEMS, INC.\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\nFORM 10-K\nFOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition at a premium price.\nThe provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may also deter, delay or prevent a third-party from acquiring us. These provisions include:\n\u00b7 limitations on the ability of stockholders to amend our charter documents, including stockholder supermajority voting requirements;\n\u00b7 the authority of the board of directors to adopt amendments to our bylaws without shareholder approval;\n\u00b7 the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings;\n\u00b7 a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u00b7 advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors and for stockholder proposals; and\n\u00b7 the authority of our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock with such terms as the board of directors may determine and to issue additional shares of our common stock.\nWe are also subject to the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15% of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock, unless board or stockholder approval were obtained.\nIn addition, in the event of a \u201cchange of control\u201d as defined in our senior facilities agreement, we may be required to, among other things, repay all of our obligations outstanding under the senior facilities agreement, with interest thereon, which could materially adversely impact the value of our common stock.\nThese provisions could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company, discourage others from making tender offers for our shares, lower the market price of our stock or impede the ability of our stockholders to change our management, even if such changes would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for holders to resell our common stock when they want or at prices that they find attractive.\nThe price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market constantly changes. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u00b7 changes in the price of DENTSPLY common stock;\n\u00b7 changes in market conditions;\n\u00b7 quarterly variations in our operating results;\n\u00b7 operating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7 changes in expectations as to our future financial performance;\nSIRONA DENTAL SYSTEMS, INC.\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\nFORM 10-K\nFOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015\n\u00b7 announcements of strategic developments, significant contracts, acquisitions and other material events by us, our competitors, or our distribution partners;\n\u00b7 the operating and securities price performance of other companies that investors believe are comparable to us;\n\u00b7 future sales of our equity or equity-related securities;\n\u00b7 changes in the economy and the financial markets;\n\u00b7 departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7 changes in governmental regulations; and\n\u00b7 geopolitical conditions, such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.\nIn addition, in recent years, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant effect on the market price of securities issued by many companies for reasons often unrelated to their operating performance. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating results.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE MERGER\nThe exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any change in either our or DENTSPLY\u2019s stock price.\nUpon closing of the Merger, each share of our common stock will be converted into the right to receive 1.8142 shares of DENTSPLY common stock. This exchange ratio will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of either DENTSPLY common stock or our common stock between the date of signing the Merger agreement and completion of the Merger. Changes in the price of DENTSPLY common stock prior to the Merger will affect the value of DENTSPLY common stock that our common stockholders will receive on the date of the Merger. The exchange ratio will be adjusted appropriately to fully reflect the effect of any stock dividend or distribution, reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or other similar transaction with respect to the shares of either DENTSPLY common stock or our common stock prior to the closing of the Merger.\nThe prices of DENTSPLY common stock and our common stock at the closing of the Merger may vary from their prices on the date the Merger agreement was executed. As a result, the value represented by the exchange ratio will also vary.\nThese variations could result from changes in the business, operations or prospects of DENTSPLY or us prior to or following the Merger, regulatory considerations, general market and economic conditions and other factors both within and beyond our or DENTSPLY\u2019s control. We may complete the Merger with DENTSPLY a considerable period after the dates of both the DENTSPLY special meeting and our special meeting. Therefore, at the time of our special stockholders meeting, our stockholders will not know with certainty the value of the shares of DENTSPLY common stock that they will receive upon completion of the Merger.\nThe Merger is subject to the receipt of consents and clearances from domestic and foreign regulatory authorities that may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on us, DENTSPLY, or the combined company or, if not obtained, could prevent completion of the Merger.\nBefore the Merger may be completed, applicable waiting periods must expire or terminate under antitrust and competition laws. In deciding whether to grant regulatory clearances, the relevant governmental entities will consider the effect of the Merger on competition within their relevant jurisdiction. The terms and conditions of the approvals that are granted may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company\u2019s business. The Merger agreement may require us and/or DENTSPLY to comply with conditions imposed by regulatory entities and, in certain circumstances, either company may refuse to close the Merger on the basis of those regulatory conditions. There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying completion of the Merger or imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the Merger. In addition, neither we nor DENTSPLY can provide assurance that any such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the Merger.\nSIRONA DENTAL SYSTEMS, INC.\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\nFORM 10-K\nFOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015\nAny delay in completing the Merger may reduce or eliminate the benefits expected to be achieved thereunder.\nIn addition to the required regulatory clearances, the Merger is subject to a number of other conditions beyond our and DENTSPLY\u2019s control that may prevent, delay or otherwise materially adversely affect its completion. Either party cannot predict whether and when these other conditions will be satisfied. Furthermore, the requirements for obtaining the required clearances and approvals could delay the completion of the Merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in completing the Merger could cause the combined company not to realize, or to be delayed in realizing, some or all of the synergies that we expect to achieve if the Merger is successfully completed within its expected time frame.\nUncertainties associated with the Merger may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees which could adversely affect the future business and operations of the combined company.\nWe and DENTSPLY are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their respective officers and other key employees to execute their business plans. The combined company\u2019s success after the Merger will depend in part upon the ability of us and DENTSPLY to retain key management personnel and other key employees. Our and DENTSPLY\u2019s current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company following the Merger, which may have an adverse effect on the ability of each of us and DENTSPLY to attract or retain key management and other key personnel. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the combined company will be able to attract or retain key management personnel and other key employees of ours and DENTSPLY to the same extent that we and DENTSPLY have previously been able to attract or retain each of our own employees. A failure by us, DENTSPLY, or, following the completion of the Merger, the combined company to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees during the period prior to or after the completion of the Merger could have a negative impact on their respective businesses.\nLawsuits have been filed against each of our and DENTSPLY\u2019s board of directors challenging the Merger and an adverse ruling may prevent the Merger from being completed.\nDENTSPLY, Merger Sub and the members of our board of directors were named as defendants in lawsuits brought by our stockholders challenging the Merger and seeking, among other things, injunctive relief to enjoin the defendants from completing the Merger on the agreed-upon terms. Additional lawsuits may be filed against DENTSPLY, Merger Sub, us and/or each of our respective directors or officers in connection with the Merger.\nOne of the conditions to the closing of the Merger is the absence of any order, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation by a court or other governmental entity that makes illegal or prohibits the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger agreement. Consequently, if a settlement or other resolution is not reached in the lawsuits referenced above and the plaintiffs secure injunctive or other relief prohibiting, delaying or otherwise adversely affecting the parties\u2019 ability to complete the Merger, then such injunctive or other relief may prevent the Merger from becoming effective within the expected time frame or at all.\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively impact the stock prices and the future business and financial results of ours and DENTSPLY\u2019s.\nCompletion of the Merger is not assured and is subject to risks, including the risks that approval of the transactions by our and DENTSPLY\u2019s stockholders or by governmental entities will not be obtained or that certain other closing conditions will not be satisfied. If the Merger is not completed, our and/or DENTSPLY\u2019s ongoing businesses and financial results may be adversely affected and we and/or DENTSPLY will be subject to several risks, including the following:\nSIRONA DENTAL SYSTEMS, INC.\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\nFORM 10-K\nFOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015\n\u00b7 having to pay certain significant costs relating to the Merger without receiving the benefits of the Merger, including, in certain circumstances, a termination fee of $280 million, in the case of DENTSPLY, and a termination fee of $205 million, in our case;\n\u00b7 the potential loss of key personnel during the pendency of the Merger as employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company;\n\u00b7 We and DENTSPLY will have been subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of their businesses which may have prevented them from making certain acquisitions or dispositions or pursuing certain business opportunities while the Merger was pending; and\n\u00b7 having had the focus of each companies\u2019 management on the Merger instead of on pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to the companies.\nIf the Merger is not completed, we and DENTSPLY cannot assure each of our respective stockholders that these risks will not materialize and will not materially adversely affect our or DENTSPLY\u2019s businesses, financial results and stock prices.\nThe Merger agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer of either us or DENTSPLY.\nThe Merger agreement contains \u201cno shop\u201d provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, restrict each of our and DENTSPLY\u2019s ability to solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage and induce, or take any other action designed to facilitate competing third-party proposals relating to a merger, reorganization or consolidation of the company or an acquisition of the company\u2019s stock or assets. Further, even if the DENTSPLY board of directors or our board of directors withdraws or qualifies its recommendation with respect to the Merger, we or DENTSPLY, as the case may be, will still be required to submit each of their merger-related proposals to a vote at each of our respective special meetings. In addition, the other party generally has an opportunity to offer to modify the terms of the Merger in response to any competing acquisition proposals before the board of directors of the company that has received a third-party proposal may withdraw or qualify its recommendation with respect to the Merger.\nThese provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant portion of us or DENTSPLY from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share cash or market value than the market value proposed to be received or realized in the Merger or might result in a potential third-party acquirer proposing to pay a lower price to the stockholders than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the $280 million or $205 million termination fee, as applicable, that may become payable in certain circumstances.\nIf the Merger agreement is terminated and either we or DENTSPLY determine to seek another business combination, it may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the Merger.\nOur and DENTSPLY\u2019s executive officers and directors have certain interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of DENTSPLY and our stockholders generally.\nOur and DENTSPLY\u2019s executive officers and directors have certain interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, the interests of DENTSPLY stockholders and our stockholders generally. Our and DENTSPLY\u2019s executive officers negotiated the terms of the Merger agreement. Our and DENTSPLY\u2019s executive officers have arrangements with us or DENTSPLY, as applicable, that provide for severance benefits if their employment is terminated under certain circumstances following the completion of the Merger. In addition, certain of our compensation and benefit plans and arrangements provide for payment or accelerated vesting or distribution of certain rights or benefits upon completion of the Merger. In the case of DENTSPLY, under the Merger agreement, DENTSPLY may act before completion of the Merger to accelerate the vesting of equity awards (stock options and RSUs denominated in DENTSPLY common stock) held by some or all of its non-employee directors who will not continue as directors of the combined company after the Merger. Executive officers and directors also have rights to indemnification and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance that will survive completion of the Merger.\nSIRONA DENTAL SYSTEMS, INC.\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\nFORM 10-K\nFOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015\nUpon completion of the Merger, the board of directors of the combined company will be comprised of eleven members, consisting of six of DENTSPLY\u2019s current directors and five of our current directors. Mr. Slovin, currently a director and our president and chief executive officer, will serve as a director and as chief executive officer of the combined company, and Mr. Wise, the current chairman and chief executive officer of DENTSPLY, will serve as executive chairman of the board of directors of the combined company. Additionally, the combined company\u2019s management team will include executives from each of us and DENTSPLY. From DENTSPLY, Christopher T. Clark (the current president and chief financial officer of DENTSPLY) will serve as president and chief operating officer, technologies of the combined company, and James G. Mosch (the current executive vice president and chief operating officer of DENTSPLY) will serve as president and chief operating officer, dental and healthcare consumables of the combined company. From us, Ulrich Michel (our current executive vice president and chief financial officer) will serve as executive vice president and chief financial officer of the combined company.\nEach of our and DENTSPLY\u2019s boards of directors were aware of these interests at the time each approved the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger agreement. These interests, including the continued employment of certain of our and DENTSPLY\u2019s executive officers by the combined company, the continued positions of certain of our and DENTPLY\u2019s directors as directors of the combined company and the indemnification of former directors and officers by the combined company, may cause our and DENTSPLY\u2019s directors and executive officers to view the Merger proposal differently and more favorably than you may view it.\nCurrent holders of our and DENTSPLY\u2019s common stock will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the Merger and will exercise less influence over management.\nCurrent holders of our and DENTSPLY common stock have the right to vote in the election of the board of directors and on other matters affecting us and DENTSPLY, respectively. Upon the completion of the Merger, each of our stockholders who receives shares of DENTSPLY common stock will become a stockholder of the combined company with a percentage ownership of the combined company that is smaller than such stockholder\u2019s percentage ownership of us. Similarly, after completion of the Merger, the shares of combined company common stock retained by each DENTSPLY stockholder will represent a smaller percentage ownership of the combined company. It is currently expected that our stockholders immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger as a group will receive shares in the Merger constituting approximately 42% of the shares of combined company common stock on a fully diluted basis immediately after the Merger. As a result, stockholders of DENTSPLY immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger as a group will own approximately 58% of the shares of combined company common stock on a fully diluted basis immediately after the Merger. Because of this, DENTSPLY and our stockholders will have less influence on the management and policies of the combined company than they now have on the management and policies of DENTSPLY and us, respectively.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE COMBINED COMPANY FOLLOWING THE MERGER\nThe combined company may be unable to integrate successfully our and DENTSPLY\u2019s businesses and realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger.\nThe success of the Merger will depend, in large part, on the ability of the combined company to realize the anticipated benefits, including cost savings, from combining our and DENTSPLY\u2019s businesses. To realize these anticipated benefits, our and DENTSPLY\u2019s businesses must be successfully integrated. This integration will be complex and time consuming. The failure to integrate successfully and to manage successfully the challenges presented by the integration process may result in the combined company not fully achieving the anticipated benefits of the Merger. Potential difficulties the combined company may encounter as part of the integration process include the following:\n\u00b7 the inability to successfully combine our and DENTSPLY\u2019s businesses in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the full revenue and cost synergies anticipated to result from the Merger;\nSIRONA DENTAL SYSTEMS, INC.\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\nFORM 10-K\nFOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015\n\u00b7 complexities associated with managing the combined businesses, including the challenge of integrating complex systems, technology, networks and other assets of each of the companies in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies;\n\u00b7 coordinating geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities;\n\u00b7 addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;\n\u00b7 integrating the workforces of the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high quality customer service; and\n\u00b7 potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased or new expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the Merger.\nIn addition, we and DENTSPLY have operated and, until the completion of the Merger, will continue to operate independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in:\n\u00b7 diversion of the attention of each company\u2019s management;\n\u00b7 disruption of existing relationships with distributors and other manufacturers in the industry that drive a substantial amount of revenues to each company; and\n\u00b7 the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, each company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, any of which could adversely affect each company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies our or DENTSPLY\u2019s ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Merger, or which could reduce each company\u2019s earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company.\nThe Merger may not be accretive and may cause dilution to the combined company\u2019s adjusted earnings per share, which may negatively affect the market price of the combined company\u2019s common stock.\nWe and DENTSPLY currently anticipate that the Merger will be accretive to stockholders on an adjusted earnings per share basis within the first full year following the completion of the Merger. This expectation is based on preliminary estimates, which may materially change. The combined company could also encounter additional transaction and integration-related costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the Merger. All of these factors could cause dilution to the combined company\u2019s adjusted earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the Merger and cause a decrease in the market value of the combined company\u2019s common stock.\nThe future results of the combined company will suffer if the combined company does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the Merger.\nFollowing the Merger, the size of the business of the combined company will increase significantly beyond the current size of either our or DENTSPLY\u2019s business. The combined company\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to manage this expanded business, which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurances that the combined company will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements and other benefits currently anticipated from the Merger.\nThe combined company is expected to incur substantial expenses related to the Merger and the integration of us and DENTSPLY.\nThe combined company is expected to incur substantial expenses in connection with the Merger and the integration of us and DENTSPLY. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, payroll, pricing, revenue management, manufacturing, research and development, marketing and benefits. While we and DENTSPLY have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred, there are many factors beyond each of our controls that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings. These integration expenses likely will result in the combined company taking significant charges against earnings following the completion of the Merger, and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present.\nSIRONA DENTAL SYSTEMS, INC.\nAND SUBSIDIARIES\nFORM 10-K\nFOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015", "PERMNO": 85208, "SIC": 3843, "TIC": "SIRO"}
