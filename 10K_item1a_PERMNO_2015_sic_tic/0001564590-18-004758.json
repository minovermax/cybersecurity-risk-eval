{"cik": "1488613", "company": "Foundation Medicine, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-07", "item_1A": "Item 1A.RISK FACTORS\nThe following risks and uncertainties, together with all other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, should be considered carefully. Any of the risk factors we describe below could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, and could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate or decline.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Strategy\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient revenue from our clinical molecular information services or our relationships with our biopharmaceutical partners to achieve and maintain profitability.\nWe believe our commercial success is dependent upon our ability to successfully market and sell our current portfolio of molecular information services, to continue to expand our current relationships and to develop new relationships with biopharmaceutical partners, and to develop and commercialize new molecular information services. Our current portfolio of molecular information services includes FoundationOne\u00ae for solid tumors; FoundationOne\u00aeHeme for hematologic malignancies and sarcomas; FoundationACT\u00ae, our liquid biopsy assay for solid tumors; FoundationFocus\u2122 CDx BRCA, our United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, -approved companion diagnostic, to aid in identifying women with ovarian cancer for whom treatment with Rubraca\u2122 (rucaparib) is being considered; and FoundationOne CDx\u2122, our FDA-approved broad companion diagnostic for solid tumors across multiple tumor types. The demand for our existing services may decrease or may not continue to increase at historical rates for a number of reasons, including among others, the development by competitors of new molecular diagnostic tests services that we are not able to commercialize and increased competition from companies that offer similar molecular diagnostic tests.\nOur molecular information services have positive coverage decisions from only a few commercial third-party payors and do not have coverage contracts with or coverage decisions from most commercial third-party payors. Certain commercial third-party payors have designated some or all of FoundationOne, FoundationOneHeme, and FoundationACT as experimental and investigational and have declined to reimburse us for these services. This designation is customarily assigned to a service by a third-party payor pending the development of clinical information deemed sufficient to support a positive coverage decision. During this assessment period, we are not being reimbursed for our services from these third-party payors, resulting, in the aggregate, in a material loss of revenue to us.\nWith respect to government payors, concurrent with FDA-approval of FoundationOne CDx in November 2017, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, issued a preliminary national coverage determination, or NCD, that proposes nationwide Medicare coverage for FoundationOne CDx and other similar next generation sequencing, or NGS, tests for Medicare beneficiaries with advanced cancer (i.e., recurrent, metastatic, or advanced stage IV cancer), who have not been previously tested using the same NGS technology, and continue to seek further cancer therapy. Specifically, the preliminary NCD proposes full coverage of FoundationOne CDx for its FDA-approved companion diagnostic claims, as well as a pathway for additional coverage under coverage with evidence development, or CED, in other solid tumor types. However, the preliminary NCD also proposes to limit coverage for FoundationOne (and other NGS-based tests offered as Laboratory Developed Tests, or LDTs) for patients with advanced cancer to tests offered within the context of a National Institute of Health-National Cancer Institute, or NIH-NCI, National Clinical Trial Network clinical trial. If the preliminary NCD is finalized in its current form, the terms of the final NCD will control over the terms of a final or draft local coverage determination, or LCD, and FoundationOne will be effectively non-covered by Medicare, once the NCD is implemented, when provided to patients with advanced cancer, including non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, notwithstanding the existence of a favorable LCD issued by Palmetto GBA, or Palmetto, the Medicare Administrative Contractor, or MAC, for the jurisdiction in which our North Carolina laboratory is located.\nOur biopharmaceutical partners may decide to decrease or discontinue their use of our molecular information platform due to changes in their research and development plans, failures in their clinical trials, financial constraints, the regulatory environment, the reimbursement landscape, or utilization of internal molecular testing resources or molecular tests performed by other parties, which are circumstances outside of our control. In addition, biopharmaceutical companies may decline to do business with us or decrease or discontinue their use of our molecular information platform due to our broad strategic collaboration with certain affiliates of Roche Holdings, Inc., or Roche, and the fact that Roche is our largest stockholder and beneficially owns a majority of our outstanding stock. In addition to reducing our revenue, if our biopharmaceutical partners decide to decrease or discontinue their use of our molecular information platform, this may reduce our exposure to early stage research that facilitates the incorporation of newly developed information about cancer into our molecular information platform and services.\nWe are currently not profitable. Even if we succeed in increasing adoption of our existing services by physicians, obtaining additional coverage decisions from commercial third-party payors and government payors, maintaining and creating relationships with our existing and new biopharmaceutical partners, and developing and commercializing additional molecular information services, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability.\nOur molecular information services may never achieve significant commercial market acceptance.\nOur molecular information services may never gain significant acceptance in the marketplace and, therefore, may never generate substantial revenue or profits for us. Our ability to achieve commercial market acceptance for our existing services will depend on several factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to convince the medical community of the clinical utility of our services and their potential advantages over existing and new molecular tests;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of physicians and patients to utilize our services; and\n\u2022\nthe agreement by commercial third-party payors and government payors to reimburse our services, the scope and amount of which will affect patients\u2019 willingness or ability to pay for our services and will likely heavily influence physicians\u2019 decisions to recommend our services.\nIn addition, physicians may rely on guidelines issued by industry groups, such as the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, medical societies, such as the College of American Pathologists, or CAP, or other key oncology-related organizations before utilizing any diagnostic test. Although we have a number of clinical trials sponsored by us and clinical trials sponsored by individual physicians, or investigator-initiated clinical trials, underway to demonstrate the clinical utility of each of our existing services, none of our services are, and may never be, listed in any such guidelines.\nWe believe that the successful completion of clinical trials, publication of scientific and medical results in peer-reviewed journals, and presentations at leading conferences are critical to the broad adoption of our services. Publication in leading medical journals is subject to a peer-review process, and peer reviewers may not consider the results of studies involving our services sufficiently novel or worthy of publication.\nThe failure to be listed in physician guidelines or the failure of our trials to produce favorable results or to be published in peer-reviewed journals could limit the adoption of our services. Failure to achieve widespread market acceptance of our services would materially harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers or, in some cases, sole suppliers, for some of our laboratory instruments and materials and may not be able to find replacements or immediately transition to alternative suppliers.\nWe rely on several sole suppliers, including Illumina, Inc., or Illumina, for certain laboratory substances used in the chemical reactions incorporated into our processes, or reagents, sequencers, equipment, and other materials which we use in our laboratory operations. The terms upon which we are able to purchase these supplies and materials from any supplier could be adversely affected by our broad strategic collaboration with Roche and the fact that Roche is our largest stockholder and beneficially owns a majority of our outstanding stock. An interruption in our laboratory operations could occur if we encounter delays or difficulties in securing these reagents, sequencers, or other laboratory materials, and if we cannot then obtain an acceptable substitute. Any such interruption could negatively impact research and development and launches of new services, and significantly affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\nFor example, we rely on Illumina as the sole supplier of sequencers and various associated reagents, and as the sole provider of maintenance and repair services for these sequencers. Our supply agreement with Illumina is also set to expire in July 2018. Any disruption in Illumina\u2019s operations, or our inability to negotiate an extension to our supply agreement or acceptable terms, or at all, could impact our supply chain and laboratory operations of our molecular information platform and our ability to conduct our business and generate revenue.\nWe believe that there are only a few other equipment manufacturers that are currently capable of supplying and servicing the equipment necessary for our laboratory operations, including sequencers and various associated reagents. The use of equipment or materials furnished by these replacement suppliers would require us to significantly alter our laboratory operations. Transitioning to a new supplier would be time-consuming and expensive, may result in interruptions in our laboratory operations, would likely affect the performance specifications of our laboratory operations, and would require that we revalidate our existing assays. There can be no assurance that we would be able to secure alternative equipment, reagents, and other materials, and bring such equipment, reagents, and materials on line and revalidate them without experiencing interruptions in our workflow. In the case of an alternative supplier for Illumina, there can be no assurance that replacement sequencers and various associated reagents would be available or would meet our quality control and performance requirements for our laboratory operations. If we should encounter delays or difficulties in securing, reconfiguring, or revalidating the equipment and reagents we require for our assays, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation could be adversely affected.\nIf one or more of our laboratory facilities become damaged or inoperable, if we are required to vacate any of our laboratory facilities, or if we are delayed in obtaining or unable to obtain additional laboratory space or delayed in commencing operations in our laboratory facilities, our ability to conduct our molecular information services, pursue our research and development efforts or our companion diagnostics partnerships, and fulfill our contractual obligations may be jeopardized.\nOur revenue is primarily derived from testing services performed at our laboratory facilities. Our facilities and equipment could be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including war, fire, earthquake, power loss, communications or internet failure or interruption, or terrorism, which may render it difficult or impossible for us to operate our molecular information platform for some period of time. The inability to perform our molecular tests or to reduce the backlog of analyses that could develop if one or more of our laboratories become inoperable, for even a short period of time, may result in the loss of customers or harm to our reputation, and we may be unable to regain those customers or repair our reputation in the future. Furthermore, our facilities and the equipment we use to perform our research and development work could be unavailable or costly and time-consuming to repair or replace. It would be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive to rebuild any of our facilities or license or transfer our proprietary technology to a third party, particularly in light of the licensure and accreditation requirements for commercial laboratories like ours. Even in the unlikely event we are able to find a third party with such qualifications to enable us to perform our molecular tests, we may be unable to negotiate commercially reasonable terms with such third parties. Adverse consequences resulting from an interruption of our overall laboratory operations could harm relationships with our customers and regulatory authorities, and our reputation, and could affect our ability to generate revenue.\nWe may also construct, acquire, or enter into relationships with third parties to procure additional laboratory space inside and outside the United States to support our existing and new tests. Our R&D Collaboration Agreement with Roche contemplates that we will collaborate with Roche on multiple programs related to the development of services for use in molecular information, immunotherapy, circulating tumor DNA, or ctDNA, and companion diagnostics and that we will provide additional laboratory space in Europe and Asia to perform genomic sequencing outside of the United States. In October 2017, our laboratory facility in Penzberg, Germany became operational. If we are unable to obtain or are delayed in obtaining or establishing new laboratory space to support these commercialization and development efforts, or if our ex-United States laboratory operations are harmed or are rendered inoperable, we could fail to meet certain contractual obligations and agreed upon timelines with certain of our biopharmaceutical partners, including Roche, or provide existing services and develop and launch new services in certain territories, which could result in harm to our business and reputation, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. As we continue to transition some of our services to new laboratories, we could experience disruptions in overall laboratory operations and could require adjustments to meet regulatory requirements, resulting in our inability to meet customer turnaround time expectations. Any delays in this transition could result in slower realization of laboratory efficiencies anticipated from operating an additional laboratory facility. Adverse consequences resulting from an interruption of our overall laboratory operations could harm relationships with our customers and regulators, and our reputation, and could affect our ability to generate revenue.\nWe carry insurance for damage to our property and laboratory and the disruption of our business, but this insurance may not cover all of the risks associated with damage to our property or laboratory or disruption to our business, may not provide coverage in amounts sufficient to cover our potential losses, may be challenged by insurers underwriting the coverage, and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIf we are unable to support demand for our existing or future services, including ensuring that we have adequate capacity to meet increased demand, or we are unable to successfully manage the evolution of our molecular information platform, our business could suffer.\nAs our volume grows, we will need to continue to increase our workflow capacity for sample intake, customer service, billing, and general process improvements; expand our internal quality assurance program; and extend our molecular information platform to support comprehensive genomic analyses at a larger scale within expected turnaround times. We will need additional certified laboratory scientists and technicians and other scientific and technical personnel to process higher volumes of our molecular information services. Portions of our process are not automated and will require additional personnel to scale. We will also need to purchase additional equipment, some of which can take several months or more to procure, set up, and validate, and increase our software and computing capacity to meet increased demand. There is no assurance that any of these increases in scale, expansion of personnel, equipment, software and computing capacities, or process enhancements will be successfully implemented, or that we will have adequate space in our laboratory facilities to accommodate such required expansion.\nAs we commercialize additional services, we will need to incorporate new equipment, implement new technology systems and laboratory processes, and hire new personnel with different qualifications. For example, we may procure additional laboratory space to allow us to further develop new services. Failure to manage this growth or transition could result in turnaround time delays, higher service costs, declining service quality, deteriorating customer service, and slower responses to competitive challenges. A failure in any one of these areas could make it difficult for us to meet market expectations for our services, and could damage our reputation and the prospects for our business.\nThe development of new services involves a lengthy and complex process, and we may be unable to successfully commercialize new services, or any other services we may develop, on a timely basis, or at all, and the development and commercialization of additional services may negatively affect the commercialization of existing services.\nFoundationOne CDx, which was approved by the FDA in November 2017, will take time to successfully commercialize, and there can be no assurance that this product will be successful in the evaluation of cancers for a variety of technical and market reasons. Additionally, because the implementation of the final NCD will render FoundationOne effectively non-covered by Medicare when\nprovided to patients with advanced cancer, including NSCLC, physicians may be less likely to order FoundationOne, case volume may decrease, and there may be a negative impact to revenue and results of operations.\nOur future molecular information services and other services in various stages of early development, will take time to develop and commercialize, if we are able to commercialize them at all. There can be no assurance that our new services will be capable of reliably identifying relevant genomic alterations in various forms of cancer. Before we can commercialize any new services, we will need to expend significant funds in order to:\n\u2022\nconduct substantial research and development, including validation studies and potentially clinical trials;\n\u2022\nbuild additional laboratory space for new services;\n\u2022\nfurther develop and scale our laboratory processes to accommodate different services;\n\u2022\nfurther develop and scale our infrastructure to be able to analyze increasingly large amounts of data; and\n\u2022\nin the case of services for which we are seeking FDA approval, pursue such FDA approval.\nOur services development process involves a high degree of risk, and services development efforts may fail for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nfailure of the service to perform as expected at the research or development stage;\n\u2022\nlack of validation data;\n\u2022\nfailure to demonstrate the clinical utility of the service; or\n\u2022\nin the case of services for which we are seeking or have received FDA approval, the inability to obtain FDA approval or the loss of FDA approval.\nAs we develop services, we will have to make significant investments in services development, marketing, and selling resources. In addition, the commercialization of newer services, such as FoundationOne CDx, may negatively affect the sales of existing services or create confusion with existing services, such as FoundationOne, where the diagnostic applications overlap. Physicians may decide to order a newer service in lieu of an existing service or may be unsure as to which service to order.\nIf we cannot compete successfully with our competitors, including new entrants in the market, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenue or achieve and sustain profitability.\nWhile personalized genomic diagnostics is a relatively new area of science, we face intense competition from companies that offer tests or have conducted research to profile genes and gene expression in various cancers. Our principal competition comes from diagnostic companies that offer molecular diagnostic tests that capture only a single-marker or hotspot panel tests that capture a limited number of the most well-known gene alterations, as well as academic research centers, diagnostic companies and NGS platform developers that are offering or developing NGS-based testing. In addition, there are an increasing number of sophisticated commercial competitors who are selling hot-spot panel test or NGS-based tests that they are marketing as comparable to, and/or more cost effective than, our existing tests.\nOur competitors include laboratory companies such as Bio-Reference Laboratories, Inc., Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, Caris Life Sciences, Guardant Health, NeoGenomics Laboratories, Genomic Health, Myriad Genetics, Personal Genome Diagnostics, Tempus, as well as laboratories outside the United States. In addition, companies such as Abbott Laboratories, Roche Diagnostics, Qiagen N.V., Nanostring Technologies, Sophia Genetics, and Sequenom manufacture or may manufacture diagnostic testing kits that are competitive with our tests or that may be viewed as substitutes for our tests by current or potential customers. There are also a significant number of early stage companies that may develop tests which compete with our tests. Recently, some of these competitors have been increasingly marketing their tests as comparable to, and/or more cost effective than, our tests, and if such marketing strategies are successful, they could result in physicians determining not to order our tests which, in turn, would have an adverse effect on our revenue, financial condition, and results of operations. As competition in our market increases, we may be subject to increased litigation risk, including in connection with our marketing practices and other promotional activities.\nMany hospitals and academic medical centers may also seek to perform the type of molecular testing we perform at their own facilities. As such, our competition may include entities such as the MD Anderson Cancer Center, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, University of Michigan, Baylor Medical Genetics Laboratories, Washington University in St. Louis, University of Washington, Intermountain Healthcare, and other academic hospitals and research centers inside and outside the United States.\nIllumina, Thermo Fisher Scientific, or Thermo Fisher, Qiagen N.V., and other companies market NGS platforms that are being sold directly to research centers, biopharmaceutical companies, and clinical laboratories. While these platforms have been largely utilized in research and development settings or testing for non-cancer conditions, many of these companies have launched and will likely continue to commercialize services for focused application in the clinical oncology market. We believe some diagnostic platform providers will seek to place sequencing machines in laboratories and to develop NGS-based LDTs for use in clinical oncology, including by seeking to decrease the cost, size, and complexity of their platforms. In addition, Illumina has received\napproval by the FDA for an in vitro diagnostic kit for metastatic colorectal cancer and Thermo Fisher has received FDA approval for a multi-gene, in vitro diagnostic NGS-based assay for NSCLC. Both FDA-approved services can be used for clients who have purchased, respectively, Illumina\u2019s and Thermo Fisher\u2019s platforms. We believe other diagnostic platform providers may develop additional FDA-approved diagnostic kits for clinical use by clients who have purchased their platforms, potentially including kits designed to identify genetic alterations in samples of solid tumors or blood-based cancers. Also, many private companies are developing information technology-based tools to support the integration of NGS testing into the clinical setting. The successful development and marketing of these services by diagnostic platform providers could enable some of our potential customers to perform clinical-grade, comprehensive genomic analyses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. These companies may also use their patent portfolios, developed in connection with developing their tests, to allege that our services infringe their patents, and we could face litigation with respect to such allegations and the validity of such patents.\nBecause our proprietary molecular information platform consists largely of trade-secret protected technology and know-how and has only limited patent protection, new and existing companies inside and outside the United States could seek to develop molecular tests that compete with ours. These competitors could have technological, financial, and market access advantages that are not currently available to us and they could develop and commercialize competing services faster than we are able to do so. Additional competition, including price competition, could have a material adverse impact on our net revenues and profitability.\nThe molecular diagnostic industry is subject to rapidly changing technology, which could make our molecular information platform, our current molecular information services, and other services we develop obsolete.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new service introductions and enhancements, and evolving industry standards, all of which could make our molecular information platform and existing and future molecular information services obsolete. Our future success will depend on our ability to keep pace with the evolving needs of our customers on a timely and cost-effective basis and to pursue new market opportunities that develop as a result of technological and scientific advances. In recent years, there have been numerous advances in technologies relating to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and advances in methods used to analyze very large amounts of genomic information. We must continuously enhance our molecular information platform and develop new services to keep pace with evolving standards of care. If we do not update our molecular information platform to reflect new scientific knowledge about cancer biology, information about new cancer therapies, or relevant clinical trials, our molecular information platform could become obsolete and sales of our existing and any new services could decline, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf our services do not perform as expected, we may not be able to achieve widespread market adoption among physicians, which would cause our operating results, reputation, and business to suffer.\nOur success depends on the market\u2019s confidence that we can provide reliable, high-quality molecular information services. There is no guarantee that the accuracy and reproducibility we have demonstrated to date will continue, particularly for clinical samples, as our test volume increases. We believe that our customers are likely to be particularly sensitive to service defects and errors, including if our services fail to detect genomic alterations with high accuracy from clinical specimens or if we fail to list, or inaccurately include, certain treatment options and available clinical trials in our test reports. As a result, the failure of our services to perform as expected would significantly impair our operating results and our reputation. We may also be subject to legal claims arising from any defects or errors.\nWe refer to the efficiency of our sequencing process as its yield. The sequencing process yields that we achieve depend on the design and operation of our sequencing process, which uses a number of complex and sophisticated biochemical, informatics, optical, and mechanical processes, many of which are highly sensitive to external factors. An operational or technological failure in one of these complex processes or fluctuations in external variables may result in sequencing processing yields that are lower than we anticipate or that vary between sequencing runs. In addition, we are regularly evaluating and refining our sequencing process. These refinements may initially result in unanticipated issues that further reduce our sequencing process yields or increase the variability of our sequencing process yields. Low sequencing process yields, or higher than anticipated variability of our sequencing processing yields, increase total sequencing costs and reduce the number of samples we can sequence in a given time period, which can cause variability in our operating results and damage our reputation.\nIn addition, our test reports match identified genomic alterations with FDA-approved targeted therapies or relevant clinical trials of targeted therapies, and in the case of FoundationOne CDx, include relevant companion diagnostic claims. If a patient or physician who orders one of our services is unable to obtain, or be reimbursed for the use of, targeted therapies because they are not indicated in the FDA-approved label for treatment of a patient\u2019s cancer, the patient is unable to enroll in an identified clinical trial due to the enrollment criteria of the trial, or some other reason, the patient or ordering physician may conclude the test report does not contain actionable information. If physicians do not believe our services consistently generate actionable information about their patients\u2019 cancers, they may be less likely to order our services, our reputation could be harmed, and our business and results of operations could suffer. Furthermore, we have made significant investments in various technologies to support adoption of our molecular information services. For example, our test reports are available to physicians using an online customer-facing portal. We believe this online portal helps physicians to more efficiently use our clinical services and will enhance the utility of comprehensive genomic profiling. We also continue to build on our existing decision support applications and to develop innovative new decision support applications, like\nFoundationSmartTrials\u2122, that support informed treatment decision-making and enable improved access to therapies. If these technologies do not work as expected or fail to gain broad utilization among clinical physicians, they will not drive adoption of our molecular information services, which would have an adverse impact on our revenue and business operations.\nIf we lose the support of key thought leaders, it may be difficult to establish services enabled by our molecular information platform as a standard of care for patients with cancer, which may limit our revenue growth and ability to achieve profitability.\nWe have established relationships with leading oncology thought leaders at premier cancer institutions and oncology networks such as the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia Cancer Center, the Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami, The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center - Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute, and the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University. If these key thought leaders determine that our molecular information platform, our existing services or other services that we develop are not clinically effective, that alternative technologies are more effective, or if they elect to use internally developed services, we could encounter significant difficulty validating our testing platform, driving adoption, or establishing our molecular information platform and tests as a standard of care, which would limit our revenue growth and our ability to achieve profitability.\nIf we cannot maintain our current relationships, or enter into new relationships, with biopharmaceutical companies, our development of services could be delayed or our revenue and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe deploy our molecular information platform to analyze tissue and blood samples provided by biopharmaceutical partners from their clinical trials. We have entered into agreements with biopharmaceutical companies in the cancer field including, Agios, Inc., Array BioPharma, AstraZeneca UK Limited, Clovis Oncology, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Pfizer Inc., and our broad collaboration with Roche.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our collaboration with Roche accounted for more than 33% of our total revenue, representing a material portion of our total revenue. We expect that our collaboration with Roche will continue to account for a material portion of our revenue in future years. The revenue attributable to Roche may fluctuate in the future, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, changes in the terms of our agreements with Roche, or a modification or termination of our relationship with Roche, could result in delays in the receipt of revenue by us, or a temporary or permanent loss of revenue to us. In addition, certain biopharmaceutical companies, including those with which we currently have agreements, may choose not to do business with us or may seek out other partners for molecular information due to our strategic collaboration with Roche and the fact that Roche is our largest stockholder and beneficially owns a majority of our outstanding stock, particularly if they are actual or potential competitors with Roche. If we are unable to continue to grow our business with biopharmaceutical companies, our business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur success in the future depends in part on our ability to maintain relationships and to enter into new relationships with biopharmaceutical partners. This can be difficult due to several factors, including internal and external constraints placed on these organizations that can limit the number and type of relationships with companies like us they can consider and consummate; that certain of our agreements governing our relationships are terminable at will by our biopharmaceutical partners; and that our biopharmaceutical partners may be dissatisfied with our services. Continued usage of our services by particular biopharmaceutical partners may also depend on whether the partner obtains positive data in its clinical trials, is able to successfully obtain regulatory approval and subsequently commercializes a therapy for which we have partnered with them to develop a companion diagnostic, or other administrative factors that are outside our control. Additionally, some of our biopharmaceutical partners have contracted with us to provide testing for large numbers of samples, which could strain our testing capacity and restrict our ability to perform tests for other customers. If we fail to maintain these relationships, or enter into new ones, our business could suffer.\nFrom time to time, we expect to engage in discussions with biopharmaceutical companies regarding commercial opportunities. There is no assurance that any of these discussions will result in a commercial agreement, or if an agreement is reached, that the resulting engagement will be successful or that any clinical trials conducted as part of the engagement will produce successful outcomes. Speculation in the industry about our existing or potential engagements with biopharmaceutical companies can be a catalyst for adverse speculation about us, our services, and our technology, which can result in harm to our reputation and our business.\nWe may be unable to manage our future growth effectively, which could make it difficult to execute our business strategy.\nWe anticipate continued growth in our business operations both inside and outside the United States. Our laboratory facilities in North Carolina and Penzberg, Germany are operational, and we have executed agreements to expand our facilities in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This expansion and any future growth could create strain on our organizational, administrative, and operational infrastructure, including laboratory operations, quality control, customer service, and sales force management. We may not be able to maintain the quality or expected turnaround times of our services or satisfy customer demand as it grows. Our ability to manage our growth properly will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial, and managerial controls, as well as our reporting systems and procedures. We plan to implement new enterprise software systems in a number of areas affecting a broad range of business processes and functional areas. The time and resources required to implement these new systems is uncertain, and failure to complete implementation in a timely and efficient manner could adversely affect our operations.\nWe have limited experience in marketing and selling our services, and if we are unable to expand our direct sales and marketing force to adequately address our customers\u2019 needs, our business may be adversely affected.\nAlthough we launched our first commercial service, FoundationOne, in June 2012, personalized genomic diagnostics is a new area of science, and we continue to focus and refine our efforts to sell, market, and receive reimbursement for our services. In addition, we have limited experience in marketing and selling some of our newer molecular information services, including FoundationOne CDx, which we expect to commercially launch in early 2018. We may not be able to market, sell, or distribute our existing services or other services we may develop effectively enough to support our planned growth.\nOur future sales in the United States will depend in large part on our ability to develop, and substantially expand, our sales force and to increase the scope of our marketing efforts. Our target market of physicians is a large and diverse market. As a result, we believe it is necessary to develop a sales force that includes sales representatives with specific technical backgrounds. We will also need to attract and develop marketing personnel with industry expertise. Competition for such employees is intense. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel or be able to build an efficient and effective sales and marketing force, which could negatively impact sales and market acceptance of our services and limit our revenue growth and potential profitability.\nOur expected future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, and integrate additional employees. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our services and to compete effectively will depend in part on our ability to manage this potential future growth effectively, without compromising quality.\nPursuant to our Ex-U.S. Commercialization Agreement with Roche, Roche has the exclusive right to commercialize FoundationOne, FoundationOneHeme, FoundationACT, FoundationOne CDx, any clinical diagnostic services developed under our R&D Collaboration Agreement with Roche, and any other services upon mutual agreement, outside of the United States to the extent Roche has not elected to exclude any countries from its territory. Subject to satisfaction of certain performance milestones, the Ex-U.S. Commercialization Agreement will remain in effect until April 2020 and may be extended by Roche for additional two-year periods. Roche has the right to terminate the agreement without cause upon six months\u2019 written notice after the initial five-year term, and either party may terminate the agreement in the event of breach by the other party. During the term of the Ex-U.S. Commercialization Agreement, we are relying on Roche\u2019s efforts to sell and market FoundationOne, FoundationOneHeme, FoundationACT, FoundationOne CDx, and potentially other future molecular information services outside of the United States, and if Roche\u2019s sales and marketing efforts are not successful, we may not achieve significant market acceptance of our services outside the United States, which would materially and adversely impact our business operations.\nFor any jurisdictions outside of the United States that Roche elects to exclude from its territory, if we believe a significant market opportunity for our services exists, we intend to enlist distribution partners and local laboratories to assist with sales, distribution, and customer support. We may not be successful in finding, attracting, and retaining distribution partners or laboratories, or we may not be able to enter into such arrangements on favorable terms. Sales practices utilized by our distribution partners that are locally acceptable may not comply with sales practices standards required under United States laws that apply to us, which could create additional compliance risk. If these additional sales and marketing efforts are not successful, we may not achieve significant market acceptance for our services in these markets, which could harm our business.\nThe loss or transition of any member of our senior management team or our inability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists, clinicians, and salespeople, or the diversion of management\u2019s attention due to the continued implementation of our collaboration with Roche, could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends on the skills, experience, and performance of key members of our senior management team. The individual and collective efforts of these employees will be important as we continue to develop our molecular information platform and additional services, and as we expand our commercial activities. The loss or incapacity of existing members of our senior management team could adversely affect our operations if we experience difficulties in hiring qualified successors.\nIn February 2017, Troy Cox succeeded Michael J. Pellini, M.D. as our Chief Executive Officer. In November 2017, Tom Civik began his employment with us as our new Chief Commercial Officer. In February 2018, Steven Kafka, Ph.D. resigned as our Chief Commercial Officer and President, and Konstantin Fiedler succeeded him as our Chief Operating Officer and Troy Cox was appointed to the additional position of President.\nThe complexity inherent in integrating a new key member of the senior management team with existing senior management may limit the effectiveness of any such successor or otherwise adversely affect our business. Leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause uncertainty or a disruption to our business or may increase the likelihood of turnover of other key officers and employees. Specifically, a leadership transition in the commercial team may cause uncertainty about or a disruption to our commercial organization, which may impact our ability to achieve sales and revenue targets.\nAll members of our senior management team have employment agreements; however, the existence of an employment agreement does not guarantee the retention of the employee for any period of time. We may make use of retention agreements to mitigate the risk of losing a member of our senior management at a time that would adversely affect key strategic initiatives or our operations as a whole, however, we cannot guarantee that the incentives provided under such retention agreement will be effective in\nretaining the relevant member of senior management. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance on any of our employees.\nOur research and development programs and laboratory operations depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists and technicians. We may not be able to attract or retain qualified scientists and technicians in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among life science businesses, particularly in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and potentially at our locations in North Carolina and Penzberg, Germany. We also face competition from universities and public and private research institutions in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel. We may have difficulties locating, recruiting, or retaining qualified sales people. In addition, our obligation to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to Roche\u2019s anti-dilution protections set forth in the Investor Rights Agreement may result in changes to our equity compensation programs, which could impact our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Recruitment and retention difficulties can limit our ability to support our research and development and sales programs. All of our employees are at will, which means that either we or the employee may terminate their employment at any time.\nThe continued implementation of our broad strategic collaboration with Roche may also divert management\u2019s focus and resources from other strategic opportunities and operational matters. In addition, this implementation could cause management and employee disruption, resulting in the possible loss of key management, sales and marketing, technical, or other personnel. If we experience any of these implementation-related issues, our business could be harmed.\nIf we were sued for product liability or professional liability, we could face substantial liabilities that exceed our resources.\nThe marketing, sale, and use of our services could lead to the filing of product liability claims were someone to allege that our services identified inaccurate or incomplete information regarding the genomic alterations of the tumor or malignancy analyzed, reported inaccurate or incomplete information concerning the available therapies for a certain type of cancer, or otherwise failed to perform as designed. We may also be subject to liability for errors in, a misunderstanding of, or inappropriate reliance upon the information we provide in the ordinary course of our business activities. A product liability or professional liability claim could result in substantial damages and be costly and time-consuming for us to defend.\nWith respect to our FDA-approved tests, FoundationFocus CDx BRCA and FoundationOne CDx, product liability lawsuits may also be subject to additional defenses resulting from the fact that these tests are approved by the FDA under a premarket approval, or PMA, application. Product liability lawsuits that allege that state law requires that FoundationFocus CDx BRCA or FoundationOne CDx be designed, labeled, or manufactured in a different manner than was approved by the FDA may be preempted by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA. However, we cannot predict whether a court would agree that such lawsuits should be preempted and defending such claims may be costly and time-consuming.\nWe maintain service and professional liability insurance, but this insurance may not fully protect us from the financial impact of defending against product liability or professional liability claims. Any product liability or professional liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our insurance rates or prevent us from securing insurance coverage in the future. Additionally, any product liability lawsuit could damage our reputation or cause current clinical or biopharmaceutical partners to terminate existing agreements and potential clinical or biopharmaceutical partners to seek other partners, any of which could impact our results of operations.\nWe depend on our information technology systems, and any failure of these systems could harm our business.\nWe depend on information technology and telecommunications systems for significant elements of our operations, including our laboratory information management system, our computational biology system, our knowledge management system, our business intelligence system, our customer relationship management system, and our online customer-facing portals for reporting and research. We have installed and are expanding a number of enterprise software systems that affect a broad range of business processes and functional areas, including, for example, systems handling human resources, financial controls and reporting, contract management, regulatory compliance, and other infrastructure operations. In addition to the aforementioned business systems, we continue to extend the capabilities of both our preventative and detective security controls by augmenting the monitoring and alerting functions, the network design, and the automatic countermeasure operations of our technical systems. These information technology and telecommunications systems support a variety of functions, including laboratory operations, test validation, sample tracking, quality control, customer service support, billing and reimbursement, research and development activities, scientific and medical curation, and general administrative activities. In addition, our third-party billing and collections provider depends upon technology and telecommunications systems provided by outside vendors. Information technology and telecommunications systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts, and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and back-up measures, some of our servers are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, malicious computer software (malware), and similar disruptive problems. Failures or significant downtime of our information technology or telecommunications systems, or those used by our third-party service providers, could prevent us from conducting our comprehensive genomic analyses, preparing and providing reports and data to pathologists and oncologists, billing payors, processing reimbursement appeals, handling patient or physician inquiries, conducting research and development activities, and managing the administrative aspects of our business. Any disruption or loss of information technology or telecommunications systems on which critical aspects of our operations depend could have an adverse effect on our business.\nSecurity breaches, loss of data, and other disruptions could compromise sensitive information related to our business or prevent us from accessing critical information and expose us to liability, which could adversely affect our business and our reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we and our third-party billing and collections provider collect and store sensitive data, including legally protected health information, personally identifiable information, intellectual property, and proprietary business information owned or controlled by us or our customers, payors, and biopharmaceutical partners. We manage and maintain our applications and data utilizing a combination of on-site systems, managed data center systems, and cloud-based data center systems. We also communicate, and facilitate the exchange of, sensitive patient data to and between customers and their contracted or affiliated healthcare providers through online customer-facing portals. These applications and related data encompass a wide variety of business-critical information including research and development information, commercial information, and business and financial information. We face four primary risks relative to protecting this critical information, including: unauthorized access risk; inappropriate disclosure risk; inappropriate modification risk; and the risk of our being unable to adequately monitor our controls over the first three risks.\nThe secure processing, storage, maintenance, and transmission of this critical information is vital to our operations and business strategy, and we devote significant resources to protecting such information. Although we take measures to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or disclosure, our information technology and infrastructure, and that of our third-party billing and collections provider, may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or malicious software or breached due to personnel error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. Any such breach or interruption could compromise the security or integrity of our networks, and the information stored there could be accessed by unauthorized parties, publicly disclosed, corrupted, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, corruption, other loss, or theft of information could result in governmental investigations, class action legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, also known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and regulatory penalties. Although we have implemented security measures and a formal, dedicated enterprise security program to prevent unauthorized access to patient data, applications such as our online customer-facing portals are currently accessible through public web portals and may, in the future, be accessible through dedicated mobile applications, and there is no guarantee we can absolutely protect our online portals or our mobile applications from breach. Unauthorized access to, or loss or dissemination of, the data embedded in or transferred via these applications could also disrupt our operations, including our ability to conduct our analyses, provide test results, bill payors or patients, process claims and appeals, provide customer assistance services, conduct research and development activities, collect, process, and prepare company financial information, provide information about our services and other patient and physician education and outreach efforts through our website, manage the administrative aspects of our business, and damage our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are a \u201ccovered entity\u201d as defined under HIPAA, and the United States Office of Civil Rights may impose penalties on a covered entity for a failure to comply with a requirement of HIPAA. Penalties will vary significantly depending on factors such as the date of the violation, whether the covered entity knew or should have known of the failure to comply, or whether the covered entity\u2019s failure to comply was due to willful neglect. These penalties include civil monetary penalties of $100 to $50,000 per violation, up to an annual cap of $1,500,000. A person who knowingly obtains or discloses individually identifiable health information in violation of HIPAA may face a criminal penalty of up to $50,000 and imprisonment up to one year. The criminal penalties increase to $100,000 and up to five years\u2019 imprisonment if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses, and to $250,000 and up to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment if the wrongful conduct involves the intent to sell, transfer, or use identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain, or malicious harm. The United States Department of Justice is responsible for criminal prosecutions under HIPAA. Furthermore, in the event of a breach as defined by HIPAA, the covered entity has specific reporting requirements under HIPAA regulations. In the event of a significant breach, the reporting requirements could include notification to the general public.\nIn addition, the interpretation and application of consumer, health-related, and data protection laws in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory, and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. If so, this could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, these privacy regulations may differ from country to country, and may vary based on whether testing is performed in the United States or in the local country. Our operations or business practices may not comply with these regulations in each country, and complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business.\nCompliance with changing European privacy laws could require us to incur significant costs or experience significant business disruption, and failure to so comply could result in an adverse impact on our business.\nIn Europe, Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of October 24, 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, or the Directive, and Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 12, 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (as amended by Directive 2009/136/EC), or the e-Privacy-Directive, have required European Union, or EU Member States to implement data protection laws to meet strict privacy requirements.\nViolations of these requirements can result in administrative measures, including fines, or criminal sanctions.\nBeginning on May 25, 2018, the Directive will be replaced by the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of April 27, 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, also known as the GDPR. The GDPR imposes a broad range of strict requirements on companies subject to the GDPR, and applies to both companies located in the EU (and most likely the European Economic Area, or EEA) and - provided certain requirements are met - also companies located outside of the EU/EEA. The GDPR will impose additional obligations and risk upon our business and will increase substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance, including fines of up to 10,000,000 Euros or up to 2% of the total worldwide annual turnover for certain comparatively minor offenses, or up to 20,000,000 Euros or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover for more serious offenses. We may incur substantial expense in complying with the new obligations to be imposed by the GDPR and we may be required to make significant changes in our business operations, all of which may adversely affect our revenue and business overall. Given the expected new law in the field of data protection, we face uncertainty as to the exact interpretation of the new requirements and we may be unsuccessful in implementing all measures required by data protection authorities or courts in interpretation of the new law. In particular, national laws of Member States of the EU are in the process of being adapted to the requirements under the GDPR, thereby implementing national laws which may partially deviate from the GDPR and impose different obligations from country to country, so that we do not expect to operate in a uniform legal landscape in EU. Also, in the field of handling genetic data, the GDPR specifically allows national laws to impose additional and more specific requirements or restrictions, and European laws have historically differed quite substantially in this field, leading to additional uncertainty.\nAmong other requirements, both the Directive and the GDPR regulate transfers of personally identifiable data that is subject to the Directive or GDPR, or Personal Data, to countries outside the EU, such as the United States, that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such Personal Data by the European Commission. We have in the past relied upon adherence to the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Safe Harbor Privacy Principles and compliance with the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks as agreed to and set forth by the United States Department of Commerce, and the EU and Switzerland, which established a means for legitimating the transfer of Personal Data by data controllers in the EEA to the United States. As a result of the October 6, 2015 Court of Justice of the EU, or CJEU, opinion in Case C-362/14 (Schrems v. Data Protection Commissioner) regarding the adequacy of the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework, the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework is no longer deemed to be a valid method of compliance with requirements set forth in the Directive (and Member States\u2019 implementations thereof) regarding the transfer of Personal Data outside of the EEA.\nIn February 2016, negotiators from the EU and the United States reached political agreement on a successor to the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework that is being referred to as the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and a draft adequacy decision was presented by the European Commission on February 29, 2016. On April 13, 2016, the Article 29 Working Party, a body made up of a representative from the data protection authority of each EU Member State, expressed \u201cstrong concerns\u201d about the adequacy of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. In its opinion on the draft adequacy decision, the Article 29 Working Party noted that the framework does not incorporate some of the key principles of the EU data protection regime. Accordingly, the EU-US Privacy Shield was subject to further negotiations and revisions. On May 26, 2016 the European Parliament adopted a resolution and on July 8, 2016, the EU Member States\u2019 representatives approved the final version of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, paving the way for the adoption of the decision by the European Commission. On July 12, 2016, the United States Department of Commerce announced that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield program would be open to registrants as of August 1, 2016. On January 12, 2017 the Swiss Government also announced the approval of the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as a valid legal mechanism to comply with Swiss requirements when transferring personal data from Switzerland to the United States. In April 2017, we completed the self-certification required under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield.\nHowever, there continues to be concerns about whether the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield will face additional challenges and whether they will continue to be a valid transfer mechanism to legitimize transfers from Europe or Switzerland, as applicable, to the United States. On September 15, 2016 a formal complaint was filed asking for an annulment of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework by the CJEU. The outcome of this case is already unclear, as there are many variables (including procedural issues). In addition, the first joint annual review of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield was carried out in October 2017 by officials from across the United States government, the European Commission, and EU data protection authorities. The report shows that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield continues to ensure an adequate level of data protection but that there is room for improvement, and requires the European Commission draw up a list of recommendations on the functioning of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield that need to be improved by the United States authorities. In addition, the Article 29 Working Party published its own report on the first annual review which was adopted on November 28, 2017, and in which they acknowledged the progress of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield in comparison to the invalidated U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework but highlighted that they have identified a number of significant concerns and important unresolved issues that need to be addressed by both the EU Commission and the United States authorities at the latest at the time of the second joint review (which is expected in October 2018). In the event no remedy is brought regarding concerns in the given time frames, the members of the Article 29 Working Party have announced they will take appropriate actions, including bringing the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield adequacy decision to national courts for them to make a reference to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling.\nIf the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework is annulled or otherwise invalidated, we will need to reevaluate our options for ensuring adequate safeguards to enable the transfer of data to the United States in compliance with European data protection laws. We expect that for the immediate future, we will continue to face uncertainty as to whether our efforts to comply with our obligations under European privacy laws will be sufficient. If we are investigated by a European data protection authority, we may face fines and other penalties. Any such investigation or charges by European data protection authorities could have a negative effect on our existing business and on our ability to attract and retain new customers.\nIn light of the ECJ opinion in the Schrems case, and considering current challenges to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, we are undertaking efforts to conform transfers of Personal Data from the EEA based on current regulatory obligations, the guidance of data protection authorities, and evolving best practices. Despite these efforts, we may be unsuccessful in establishing conforming means of transferring such data from the EEA, including due to ongoing legislative activity, which may vary the current data protection landscape.\nWe may also experience hesitancy, reluctance, or refusal by European or multi-national customers to continue to use our services due to the potential risk exposure to such customers as a result of the ECJ ruling in the Schrems case and the current (and, in particular, future) data protection obligations imposed on them by certain data protection authorities in interpretation of current law and the future GDPR. Such customers may also view any alternative approaches to compliance as being too costly, too burdensome, too legally uncertain, or otherwise objectionable and therefore decide not to do business with us.\nWe and our customers are at risk of enforcement actions taken by certain EU data protection authorities until such point in time that we may be able to ensure that all transfers of Personal Data to us from the EEA are conducted in compliance with all applicable regulatory obligations, the guidance of data protection authorities, and evolving best practices. We may find it necessary to establish systems to maintain Personal Data originating from the EU in the EEA, which may involve substantial expense and may cause us to need to divert resources from other aspects of our business, all of which may adversely affect our business.\nThe e-Privacy Directive will likely be replaced in time by a new e-Privacy Regulation which may impose additional obligations and risk for our business. However, the draft e-Privacy Regulation is still in negotiations in the legislative procedure and it cannot yet be foreseen what the final law will look like and when it will enter into force.\nWe may acquire other businesses, form joint ventures, or make investments in other companies or technologies that could negatively affect our operating results, dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership, increase our debt, or cause us to incur significant expense.\nOur business strategy may, from time to time, include pursuing acquisitions of businesses and assets. We also may pursue strategic alliances and joint ventures that leverage our proprietary molecular information platform and industry experience to expand our offerings or distribution. We have no experience with acquiring other companies. Negotiating these transactions and the formation of strategic alliances or joint ventures can be time-consuming, difficult, and expensive, and our ability to execute and/or close these transactions may be subject to third-party approvals, including, in some cases, the approval of Roche pursuant to the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement or our credit facility with Roche, or the Roche Credit Facility, as well as governmental authorities, which are beyond our control. In addition, some third parties may choose not to enter into partnership arrangements with us because of our relationship with Roche. Consequently, we may not be able to complete such transactions on favorable terms or at all, and we can make no assurance that these transactions, once undertaken and announced, will close.\nAn acquisition or investment may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, such as:\n\u2022\nWe could experience difficulty in integrating businesses, services, personnel, operations, and financial and other controls and systems, and retaining key employees.\n\u2022\nWe may assume by acquisition, joint venture, or strategic relationship unknown liabilities, known contingent liabilities that become realized, or known liabilities that prove greater than anticipated.\n\u2022\nWe may have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business.\n\u2022\nWe may incur debt, contingent liabilities, or future write-offs of intangible assets or goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\n\u2022\nIntegration of an acquired company may disrupt ongoing operations and require management resources that we would otherwise focus on developing our existing business, and as a result, we cannot be assured that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, technology license, strategic alliance, or joint venture would be realized.\n\u2022\nWe may have interests that diverge from those of our joint venture partners or other strategic partners and we may not be able to direct the management and operations of the joint venture or other strategic relationship in the manner we believe is most appropriate, thereby exposing us to additional risk.\nThese challenges related to acquisitions or investments could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nTo finance any acquisitions or joint ventures, we may choose to issue shares of our common stock as consideration, which could dilute the ownership of our stockholders, if the issuance does not trigger our repurchase obligations under the Investor Rights Agreement, and could be subject to the prior consent of Roche, which might not be given. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, or if Roche does not provide consent for transactions requiring their approval, we may not be able to acquire other companies or fund a joint venture project using our stock as consideration.\nInternational expansion of our business exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial, and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nOur business strategy incorporates plans for significant international expansion through our collaboration with Roche. Pursuant to our Ex-U.S. Commercialization Agreement with Roche, in April 2016, Roche obtained the exclusive right to commercialize FoundationOne and FoundationOneHeme, in October 2017, the exclusive right to commercialize FoundationACT, and in February 2018, the exclusive right to commercialize FoundationOne CDx, in each case outside of the United States.\nAdditionally, if terms are agreed upon between us and Roche, Roche may obtain the exclusive right to commercialize any new clinical diagnostic services developed under the R&D Collaboration Agreement, or upon mutual agreement any of our other services, in each case outside of the United States to the extent Roche has not elected to exclude any countries from its territory. Our laboratory facility in Penzberg, Germany became operational in 2017, and our Ex-U.S. Commercialization Agreement also contemplates that we will provide additional laboratory space in Asia to perform genomic sequencing for FoundationOne, FoundationOneHeme, and FoundationACT. Subject to satisfaction of certain performance milestones, the Ex-U.S. Commercialization Agreement will remain in effect until April 2020 and may be extended by Roche for additional two-year periods. Roche has the right to terminate the agreement without cause upon six months\u2019 prior written notice after the initial five-year term, and either party may terminate the agreement in the event of breach by the other party. Since Roche has the exclusive right to commercialize FoundationOne, FoundationOneHeme, FoundationACT, Foundation CDx, and, if terms are agreed upon between us and Roche, any new clinical diagnostic services developed under the R&D Collaboration Agreement, our ability to achieve commercial success outside the United States, including growing test volume and revenue, obtaining coverage decisions from commercial and government payors, and developing and operating a sustainable international commercial infrastructure, relies to a significant extent on the performance of Roche.\nDoing business internationally involves a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nmultiple, conflicting, and changing laws and regulations such as data protection laws, privacy regulations, tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements (including requirements related to patient consent, testing of genetic material and reporting the results of such testing) and other governmental approvals, permits, and licenses, or government delays in issuing such approvals, permits, and licenses;\n\u2022\nfailure by us or Roche to obtain regulatory approvals for the manufacture, sale, and use of our services in various countries;\n\u2022\ntransition and management of our former distribution relationships in various countries;\n\u2022\nadditional, potentially relevant third-party intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\ncomplexities and difficulties in obtaining protection for and enforcing our intellectual property;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\ncomplexities associated with obtaining reimbursement from and managing multiple payor reimbursement regimes, government payors, or patient self-pay systems;\n\u2022\nlogistics and regulations associated with preparing, shipping, importing and exporting tissue and blood samples, including infrastructure conditions, transportation delays, and customs;\n\u2022\nlimits in our ability to penetrate international markets if we are not able to perform our molecular tests locally;\n\u2022\nfinancial risks, such as the impact of local and regional financial crises on demand and payment for our services, and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, political, and economic instability, including wars, terrorism, and political unrest, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade, and other business restrictions; and\n\u2022\nregulatory and compliance risks that relate to maintaining accurate information and control over sales and distribution activities that may fall within the purview of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, including its books and records provisions, or its anti-bribery provisions.\nAny of these factors could significantly harm our future international expansion and operations and, consequently, our revenue and results of operations. The difference in regulations under United States law and the laws of foreign countries may be significant and, in order to comply with the laws of foreign countries, we may have to implement global changes to our services or business practices. Such changes may result in additional expense to us and either reduce or delay development of our services, commercialization or sales. In addition, any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of\nindividuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments, and restrictions on certain business activities. Also, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our activities in these countries.\nOur international operations could be affected by changes in laws, trade regulations, labor and employment regulations, and procedures and actions affecting approval, services, pricing, reimbursement and marketing of our services, as well as by inter-governmental disputes. Any of these changes could adversely affect our business.\nOur success internationally will depend, in part, on our ability to develop and implement policies and strategies that are effective in anticipating and managing these and other risks in the countries in which we do business. Failure to manage these and other risks may have a material adverse effect on our operations in any particular country and on our business as a whole.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and other worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nInternational customers have ordered, or may, in the future, order our services, and we are, therefore, subject to the FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making payments in violation of law to non-United States government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any other improper advantage.\nWe use third-party collaborators, strategic partners, law firms, and other representatives for regulatory compliance, patent registration, and other purposes in a variety of countries, including those that are known to present a high corruption risk. Our reliance on Roche to sell our services internationally demands a high degree of vigilance in maintaining our policy against participation in corrupt activity because we can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party collaborators, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities. In addition, although we have implemented policies and procedures to ensure compliance with anti-corruption and related laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, or agents will comply with these laws at all times. Other United States companies in the medical device and pharmaceutical field have faced criminal penalties under the FCPA for allowing their agents to deviate from appropriate practices in doing business with these individuals. We are also subject to similar anti-bribery laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including the United Kingdom\u2019s Bribery Act of 2010, which prohibits commercial bribery and makes it a crime for companies to fail to prevent bribery.\nThese laws are complex and far-reaching in nature, and, as a result, we cannot assure you that we would not be required in the future to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws, any changes in these laws, or the interpretation thereof. Noncompliance with these and other relevant laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and debarment from contracting with certain governments or other persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage, and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could further harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur employees, principal investigators, consultants, and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements, and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, principal investigators, consultants, and commercial partners. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of the FDA and non-United States regulatory authorities, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, report financial information or data accurately, or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing, and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing, and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs, and other business arrangements. Such misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical studies, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. We currently have a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and our code of conduct and the other precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses, or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could result in the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions, which could have a significant impact on our business. Whether or not we are successful in defending against such actions or investigations, we could incur substantial costs, including legal fees, and divert the attention of management in defending ourselves against any of these actions or investigations.\nIf we use hazardous materials in a manner that causes injury, we could be liable for damages.\nOur activities currently require the use of hazardous chemicals. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury to employees or third parties from the use, storage, handling, or disposal of these materials. In the event of contamination or\ninjury, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources or any applicable insurance coverage we may have. Additionally, we are subject on an ongoing basis to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling, and disposal of these materials and specified waste services. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may become significant and could negatively affect our operating results.\nOur income tax provision and other tax liabilities may be insufficient if taxing authorities are successful in asserting tax positions that are contrary to our position.\nSignificant judgment is required by us to determine our provision for income taxes and our liabilities for taxes. From time to time, we are reviewed or audited by various federal, state, local, and foreign authorities regarding income tax matters. Although we believe our judgment in determining the appropriate tax treatment is supportable and in accordance with relevant guidance, it is possible that the final tax authority may take a tax position that is different than that which is reflected in our income tax provision or different than the taxes we previously paid. Such differences could have a material adverse effect on our income tax provision or benefit or otherwise require the payment of additional taxes and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and/or cash flows for such period.\nReimbursement and Regulatory Risks Relating to Our Business\nIf commercial third-party payors or government payors fail to provide coverage or adequate reimbursement, or if there is a decrease in the extent of coverage or amount of reimbursement for our existing services or any future services we develop, our revenue and prospects for profitability would be harmed.\nOverview\nIn both domestic and many international markets, sales of our existing and any future services we develop will depend, in large part, upon the availability of adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. These third-party payors include government healthcare programs in various markets, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, managed care providers, accountable care organizations, private health insurers, and other organizations. We believe that obtaining a positive Medicare LCD or NCD, and a favorable Medicare reimbursement rate, and obtaining the agreement of established commercial third-party payors to provide coverage and to pay, for each of our existing services, and any future services we develop, across substantially all medically indicated cancers will be a necessary element in achieving material commercial success. Physicians may not order our services unless commercial third-party payors and government payors authorize coverage and pay for all, or a substantial portion, of the rates established for our services.\nCommercial third-party payors and government payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by lowering reimbursement rates, limiting coverage of diagnostic services, and creating conditions of reimbursement, such as requiring participation in clinical evidence development involving research studies and the collection of physician decision impact and patient outcomes data. Certain commercial third-party payors may not agree to reimburse our existing services or future services if CMS or the Medicare administrative contractors, or MACs, assigned to the jurisdictions in which our operational laboratory facilities are located do not issue positive coverage decisions, and pay for, such services. As a result of these cost-containment trends, commercial third-party payors and government payors that currently provide, or in the future may provide, reimbursement for one or more of our services may reduce, suspend, revoke, or discontinue payments or coverage at any time, including those payors that designate one or more of our existing services and/or clinically indicated tumor types as experimental and investigational. Payors may also create conditions for coverage or may contract with third-party vendors to manage laboratory benefits, in both cases creating administrative hurdles for ordering physicians and patients that may make our services more difficult to sell. The percentage of submitted claims that are ultimately paid, the length of time to receive payment on claims, and the average reimbursement of those paid claims is likely to vary from period to period.\nThere is significant uncertainty surrounding whether the use of services that incorporate new technology, such as our portfolio of molecular information services, will be eligible for coverage by commercial third-party payors and government payors or, if eligible for coverage, what the reimbursement rates will be for these services. The fact that a diagnostic service has been approved for reimbursement in the past, has received FDA approval, or has obtained coverage for any particular indication or in any particular jurisdiction, does not guarantee that such diagnostic service will remain covered and/or reimbursed or that similar or additional diagnostic services and/or clinically indicated tumor types will be covered and/or reimbursed in the future. We have had claims for reimbursement denied by certain commercial third-party payors, in some cases because they have designated some or all of FoundationOne, FoundationOneHeme, and FoundationACT as experimental and investigational. Reimbursement of NGS-based cancer tests by commercial third-party payors and government payors may depend on a number of factors, including a payor\u2019s determination that our existing and future services are:\n\u2022\nnot experimental or investigational;\n\u2022\nmedically reasonable and necessary;\n\u2022\nappropriate for the specific patient;\n\u2022\ncost effective;\n\u2022\nsupported by peer-reviewed publications;\n\u2022\nincluded in clinical practice guidelines and pathways; and\n\u2022\nsupported by clinical utility and health economic studies demonstrating improved outcomes and cost effectiveness.\nAs a result, our efforts to pursue coverage on behalf of patients will take a substantial amount of time, and various commercial third-party payors and government payors may never cover or provide adequate payment for our existing and future services. Our strategy to achieve broad reimbursement and coverage is focused on demonstrating the clinical utility and economic benefits of our services, including engagement with key members of the oncology community and increasing physician demand, but there is no assurance that we will succeed in any of these areas or that, even if we do succeed, we will receive favorable coverage and reimbursement decisions. If adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement are unavailable, we may not be able to maintain volume and price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in research and development. Furthermore, if a commercial third-party payor or government payor denies coverage and payment, it may be difficult for us to collect from the patient, and we may not be successful in doing so.\nGovernment Payors\nIn the second quarter of 2016, the FDA and CMS accepted FoundationOne CDx for the Parallel Review program. The Parallel Review program provides concurrent review of a medical device by the FDA for marketing approval and by CMS for an NCD to facilitate patient access to innovative medical devices. In November 2017, the FDA approved FoundationOne CDx for detection of substitutions, insertion and deletion alterations, and copy number alterations in 324 genes and select gene rearrangements, as well as genomic signatures including microsatellite instability and tumor mutational burden, using DNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tumor tissue specimens. FoundationOne CDx is intended as a companion diagnostic for patients with certain NSCLC, melanoma, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer, or breast cancer to identify those patients who may benefit from treatment with one of 17 on-label targeted therapies in accordance with FDA-approved therapeutic product labeling. Additionally, FoundationOne CDx is intended to provide tumor mutation profiling to be used by qualified health care professionals in accordance with professional guidelines in oncology for cancer patients with solid malignant neoplasms.\nConcurrent with FDA approval of FoundationOne CDx in November 2017, CMS issued a preliminary NCD that proposes nationwide Medicare coverage for FoundationOne CDx and other similar NGS tests for Medicare beneficiaries with advanced cancer (i.e., recurrent, metastatic, or advanced stage IV cancer), who have not been previously tested using the same NGS technology, and continue to seek further cancer therapy. Specifically, the preliminary NCD proposes full coverage of FoundationOne CDx for its FDA-approved companion diagnostic claims, as well as a pathway for additional coverage under CED in other solid tumor types. We cannot predict the Medicare reimbursement rate or whether the Medicare reimbursement rate established for this test will be favorable at the time of the initial rate determination or any time thereafter. If the Medicare reimbursement rate is unfavorable, we could experience a negative impact on revenue. Further, under the preliminary NCD, for NGS testing to qualify for coverage under CED, certain requirements must be met with respect to patient enrollment in a qualifying registry or clinical trial, and such requirements may be difficult to meet, and therefore coverage under CED may be unavailable or difficult to obtain, which may adversely affect reimbursement for FoundationOne CDx and negatively impact revenue.\nThe preliminary NCD proposes national coverage under Medicare for FoundationOne CDx and other FDA- approved NGS tests, and would apply to all local MACs and Medicare Advantage plans. If the preliminary NCD is finalized in its current form, the terms of the final NCD would apply, and the terms of an LCD would no longer apply, to FoundationOne CDx and other NGS tests offered as LDTs, such as FoundationOne. As a result, if the preliminary NCD is implemented in its current form, FoundationOne will be effectively non-covered by Medicare when provided to patients with advanced cancer, including NSCLC. Non-coverage of FoundationOne may cause the volume of FoundationOne orders to decrease, which may negatively impact revenue and results of operations.\nFor tests we may offer that are not subject to an NCD, local MACs that administer the Medicare program in various regions have discretion in determining coverage for tests, subject to Medicare rules. A MAC assigned to a jurisdiction in which we have an operational laboratory facility may deny a claim submitted by us related to that facility. Even if we do receive coverage from a MAC on appeal of a denied claim, the reimbursement rate may be lower than we expect if the service is not currently priced on the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, and if such rate is then adopted by commercial third-party payors, it would have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. In addition, a MAC may, insofar as such determination is not inconsistent with an NCD, issue an LCD for one or more of our existing or future services, and/or for one or more clinically indicated tumor types involved with such services that would apply to future claims. Although we would have the opportunity to submit additional materials in support of a positive LCD for our services to the MAC (or to CMS through the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals for claims-level appeals), there is no guarantee that the MAC will provide us with any additional positive LCDs or claims decisions, reverse any previously issued negative LCDs or claims decisions, or maintain any previously issued positive LCDs. In circumstances of non-coverage under an NCD or LCD, we may be required to obtain a signed advance beneficiary notice, or ABN, from Medicare patients in order to be paid directly by the patient for non-covered services.\nIf CMS issues a negative NCD, or a MAC assigned to the jurisdiction in which one of our operational laboratory facilities is located issues a negative LCD, with respect to one or more of our services and/or clinically indicated tumor types, or if CMS under an NCD or a MAC under an LCD establishes patient eligibility conditions, data collection obligations or other requirements that are difficult and/or costly to satisfy, or if a MAC denies reimbursement of one or more of these services in claims not covered by an NCD or LCD, our revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected because we may not be able to satisfy such requirements, our costs in meeting reimbursement requirements may increase, or we will not receive revenue or will receive decreased revenue for tests performed. Similarly, if CMS or a MAC withdraws or negatively changes its coverage policies after deciding to cover one or more of our services, our revenue and results of operations would be adversely affected. Physicians may be less likely to order a test for a patient if the test is not subject to a positive coverage determination such that the patient could ultimately be responsible for all or substantially all of the cost of the test. We may also be less likely to receive a positive coverage determination by commercial third-party payors insofar as Medicare identifies one or more of our tests as non-covered in an NCD or LCD.\nPalmetto is the MAC for the jurisdiction in which our North Carolina laboratory is located. In May 2015, Palmetto published a final LCD, or the Palmetto LCD, which included reimbursement for comprehensive genomic profiles for highly validated testing in an initial subset of patients diagnosed with NSCLC. The Palmetto website listed FoundationOne as a covered test under this LCD effective October 1, 2015.\nIn September 2016, we began receiving test requisitions and samples from commercial customers at our North Carolina facility and performing components of FoundationOne and FoundationOneHeme testing at the facility. In accordance with CMS guidance, in January 2017, we began submitting an initial set of claims to Palmetto for FoundationOne test requisitions received in our North Carolina facility. We submitted these claims using miscellaneous Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes with unique McKesson Z Code identifiers. On March 1, 2017, we received our first payments for claims under the Palmetto LCD. Payment for all claims processed to date by Palmetto has been made based upon the allowable rate of $3,416 per test. Although we are performing components of our testing services for FoundationOneHeme in our North Carolina facility, Palmetto has not issued an LCD that covers FoundationOneHeme; therefore, we are providing ABNs to Medicare patients who receive FoundationOneHeme testing. We are still in the process of determining what other types of services we may conduct at this facility. Such determination will be subject to the existence and limitations of applicable licenses and approvals, our ability to meet laboratory and testing requirements, and our ability to accommodate logistical and commercial needs in the test ordering and fulfillment process.\nIn the preliminary NCD for FoundationOne CDx, however, CMS proposes to significantly limit coverage for FoundationOne (and other NGS-based tests offered as LDTs) to patients with advanced cancer whose testing is performed within the context of an NIH-NCI National Clinical Trial Network clinical trial. If the preliminary NCD is finalized in its current form, the terms of the final NCD would apply, and the terms of an LCD would no longer apply, so once the NCD is implemented, FoundationOne will be effectively non-covered by Medicare when provided to patients with advanced cancer, including NSCLC. Non-coverage of FoundationOne may cause the volume of FoundationOne orders to decrease, which may negatively impact revenue and results of operations.\nIn parallel, we have been engaged in conversations with Palmetto regarding the potential for coverage and payment by Palmetto for FoundationOne claims submitted by our North Carolina laboratory for Medicare patients having tumor types other than NSCLC, as well as coverage and payment for testing. In December 2016, Palmetto issued three draft LCDs for the use of comprehensive genomic profiling to guide treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, with metastatic melanoma, and with advanced primary peritoneal, fallopian tube and ovarian cancer. However, these draft LCDs may be delayed, may never be finalized, or if the LCDs are finalized, the coverage established by such LCDs may not result in payment for claims submitted by our North Carolina laboratory. There is no certainty that Palmetto will provide coverage for such Medicare patients, and if coverage is provided, that such coverage will result in payments for claims submitted by our North Carolina laboratory. We will also be required to obtain as part of the test order process an executed ABN form from Medicare patients for non-covered tumor types in order to bill Medicare patients directly, which activity may have a negative impact on test utilization and our revenue and profitability.\nCommercial Payors\nWe are currently considered an \u201cout-of-network provider\u201d by many commercial third-party payors because we have not entered into specific contracts to provide one or more of our existing services for their health plan beneficiaries, and as a result, patients may have higher out-of-pocket costs for our services and be subject to health plan requirements such as prior authorization. Physicians may be less likely to order our tests if patients have higher out-of-pocket costs or administrative hurdles, which would in turn have a negative effect on revenue and results of operations. If we were to become a contracted provider with additional commercial third-party payors in the future, the amount of overall reimbursement we receive may decrease if coverage is furnished for only a limited number of tumor types and/or we are reimbursed less money per test performed at a contracted rate than at a non-contracted rate, which could have a negative impact on our revenue. We may also be unable to collect patient out-of-pocket payments amounts directly from patients, and may experience lost revenue as a result. In addition, a payor\u2019s decision to cover our services only in a specific tumor type such as NSCLC could also result in our inability to receive payment for other non-covered tumor types, resulting in lost volume and revenue. Finally, our contracts with current and any additional third-party payors will be subject to renewal, and the renewal process could result in lower reimbursement rates or elimination of reimbursement to us if the parties fail to agree to the terms of renewal and the contract is terminated.\nPolicy Considerations\nThe United States and foreign governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. For example, in some foreign markets, the government controls the pricing of many healthcare services. We expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals to implement governmental controls or impose healthcare requirements. In addition, the Medicare program and increasing emphasis on managed or accountable care in the United States will continue to put pressure on utilization and pricing. Utilization and cost control initiatives could decrease the volume of orders and payment that we would receive for any services in the future, which would limit our revenue and profitability.\nFailure to comply with government laws and regulations related to submission of claims for our services could result in significant monetary damages and penalties and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and corresponding foreign reimbursement programs.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations governing the submission of claims for payment for our services, such as those relating to coverage of our services under Medicare and other state, federal and foreign health care programs, the amounts that we may bill for our services, and the party to which we must submit claims. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in our inability to receive payment for our services or in attempts by state and federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, to recover payments already made. Submission of claims in violation of these laws and regulations can result in recoupment of payments already received, substantial civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from state and federal health care programs, and can subject us to liability under the federal False Claims Act and similar laws. The failure to report and return an overpayment to the Medicare or Medicaid program within 60 days of identifying its existence can give rise to liability under the False Claims Act. Further, a government agency could attempt to hold us liable for causing the improper submission of claims by another entity for services that we performed if we were found to have knowingly participated in the arrangement at issue.\nChanges in the way that the FDA regulates laboratory tests developed, manufactured, validated, and performed by laboratories like ours could result in additional expense in offering our current and any future services or even possibly delay or suspend development, manufacture, or commercialization of such services.\nWe market in vitro diagnostic medical devices, including FoundationOne CDx and FoundationFocus CDx BRCA, which are approved and regulated by the FDA as Class III medical devices and LDTs, such as FoundationOne, FoundationOneHeme, and FoundationACT. Each category is subject to different regulatory oversight, which presents different risk factors.\nThe FDA does not currently regulate most LDTs. Since the early 1990s, the FDA has taken the position that, although LDTs are medical devices, it would exercise enforcement discretion by not requiring compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, or its regulations for LDTs. That remains the policy of the FDA today. However, FDA has taken certain actions in the past that, if renewed by the FDA, could result in a new regulatory approach for LDTs. In June 2010, the FDA announced that it no longer intended to exercise enforcement discretion for LDTs and in October 2014, the FDA published two draft guidance documents that, if finalized, would implement a regulatory approach for most LDTs. The draft guidance documents proposed to impose a risk-based, phased-in approach for LDTs similar to the existing framework for in vitro diagnostic devices. In November 2016, the FDA announced that it would not finalize the draft guidance documents for LDTs prior to the end of the Obama administration.\nIn January 2017, the FDA released a discussion paper synthesizing public comments on the 2014 draft guidance documents and outlining an updated possible approach to regulation of LDTs. Although the discussion paper has no legal status and does not represent a final version of the LDT draft guidance documents, it proposes a risk-based framework that would require most LDTs to comply with most of the FDA\u2019s regulatory requirements for medical devices. Under the Trump administration, the FDA has not yet taken any regulatory action to regulate LDTs and has indicated that the FDA would support legislative action. We cannot predict whether the FDA will take action to regulate LDTs or what approach the FDA will seek to take.\nLegislative proposals have been introduced in Congress or publicly circulated, each of which would implement differing approaches to the regulation of LDTs. In March 2017, a discussion draft of the Diagnostic Accuracy and Innovation Act, or DAIA, was circulated which, if enacted, would implement a regulatory scheme for all diagnostic tests, including both in vitro diagnostic devices and LDTs. Under DAIA, CMS would have jurisdiction over laboratory operations under an amended Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments Act, or CLIA, and FDA would regulate the design, development and validation of diagnostic tests under an amended FDCA. We cannot predict whether this bill or any other any other legislative proposal will be enacted into law or the impact such new legal requirements would have on our business.\nIn addition, in November 2013, the FDA finalized guidance regarding the sale and use of products labeled for research or investigational use only. Among other things, the guidance states that the FDA continues to be concerned about distribution of research- or investigational-use only products intended for clinical diagnostic use. The guidance states that the FDA will assess whether a manufacturer of such research- or investigational-use only products intends its products be used for clinical diagnostic purposes by examining the totality of circumstances, including advertising, instructions for clinical interpretation, presentations that describe clinical use, and specialized technical support such as assistance performing clinical validation, surrounding the distribution\nof the product in question. The FDA has advised that if evidence demonstrates that a product is inappropriately labeled for research- or investigational-use only, the device could be deemed misbranded and adulterated within the meaning of the FDCA. Some of the reagents and other components we use in FoundationOne, FoundationOneHeme, and FoundationACT are currently labeled as research-use only products. If the FDA were to undertake enforcement actions, some of our suppliers may cease selling research-use only products to us, and any failure to obtain an acceptable substitute could significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor tests that are subject to FDA regulation, we may not be able to obtain timely approvals for our tests or for modifications to our tests, which could delay or prevent us from commercializing our tests and harm our business.\nIf the FDA takes action to finalize and implement a regulatory system for LDTs, or if legislation is enacted that subjects LDTs to FDA regulation, we would need to comply with the FDA regulatory requirements for our LDTs, including FoundationOne, FoundationOneHeme, FoundationACT, or any future LDTs intended for clinical use. If the FDA takes action to regulate LDTs as devices, we believe that our LDTs would likely be regulated as either Class II or Class III devices.\nWe currently also market two companion diagnostic devices, FoundationFocus CDx BRCA and FoundationOne CDx, which are regulated by the FDA as Class III medical devices and are marketed under approved PMA applications.\nIf services that are currently marketed as LDTs become subject to FDA requirements for medical devices, including requirements for premarket clearance or approval, we may not be able to obtain such clearance or approvals on a timely basis, or at all. Our business could be negatively impacted if we are required to stop selling molecular information services pending their clearance or approval, or the launch of any new services that we develop could be delayed. Likewise, for tests that are regulated as medical devices, we may not be able to obtain clearance or approval of new devices or modifications to marketed devices on a timely basis, or at all, which could delay or prevent us from commercializing our tests and harm our business.\nThe cost of conducting clinical trials and otherwise developing data and information to support device PMA applications may be significant. In order to conduct a clinical investigation involving human subjects for the purpose of demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a device, a sponsor of an investigation must, among other things, apply for and obtain institutional review board, or IRB, approval of the proposed investigation. In addition, if the clinical study involves a \u201csignificant risk\u201d (as defined by the FDA) to human health, the sponsor of the investigation must also submit and obtain FDA approval of an investigational device exemption, or IDE, application. We or the applicable study sponsor, as applicable, may not be able to obtain FDA and/or IRB approval to undertake clinical trials in the United States for any new devices we intend to market in the United States. Further, if the IDE application is approved, there can be no assurance the FDA will determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. We must also comply with other FDA requirements for clinical trials related to informed consent, monitoring, record-keeping, reporting and the submission of information regarding certain clinical trials to a public database maintained by the NIH. Compliance with these requirements can require significant time and resources and if the FDA determines that we have not complied with such requirements, it may refuse to consider the data to support our applications or initiate enforcement actions. In addition, we, the FDA, or the IRB, may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.\nA Class III medical device must be approved by the FDA under a PMA, prior to marketing the device. A PMA application must be supported by valid scientific evidence to demonstrate a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness of the subject device, typically including the results of human clinical trials that demonstrate the clinical validity of that test. A PMA application must also include information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing, and labeling. In addition to the time to develop the necessary supporting data, including to conduct clinical trials, the FDA review and approval process for a PMA application generally takes a year or longer. Even if the FDA approves a PMA application, the FDA can impose post approval conditions that it believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, and distribution.\nIn addition, we must submit and receive FDA approval of a PMA supplement for any modification to our PMA-approved tests that could affect the safety or effectiveness of the device. Modifications that may require a PMA supplement include: new indications for use, such as the addition of new companion diagnostic claims for new therapies to our FoundationOne CDx device; labeling changes; manufacturing changes; changes in the performance specifications for the device; and changes to the design of the device. We may be required to conduct additional clinical trials to support a PMA supplement for a modification to our device. The time for FDA review and approval of a supplement depends on the nature of the modification. FDA review and approval of a PMA supplements for significant changes to a device (such as a modified indication) generally takes six months to a year, but can take longer.\nWith the approval of FoundationOne CDx and other similar tumor profiling tests, the FDA announced a new approach to tumor profiling NGS tests. This approach would include three levels for reporting biomarkers: (1) companion diagnostic claims, (2) cancer mutations with evidence of clinical significance, such as clinical evidence in professional guidelines, and (3) cancer mutations with potential clinical significance, which may be informational or used to direct patients towards clinical trials. Following FDA review and authorization of a tumor profiling test, test developers can report additional level 2 or level 3 variants of the same type within\nexisting analytically validated genes without FDA approval of a PMA supplement. Test developers may also move mutations from level 3 to level 2 as evidence of clinical significance becomes recognized by the clinical community without an additional FDA submission. Additional level 1 companion diagnostic claims, however, will continue to require a PMA supplement as discussed above.\nDuring the review of our PMA applications or PMA supplements, the FDA may indicate areas in which the FDA believes additional data or information is necessary to reach a decision on an application. We may need to expend significant time and resources in responding to such FDA requests, which could include performing additional testing or developing new data to support the PMA application. Depending on the nature of the requests, we may not be able to provide the data or information that the FDA believes necessary to resolve the deficiencies and obtain FDA approval of the PMA application or PMA supplement.\nIn addition, as part of its review of a PMA application, the FDA may conduct preapproval current good manufacturing practices inspections as well as a data integrity inspection pursuant to the FDA\u2019s Bioresearch Monitoring (BIMO) program and conduct preapproval inspections of our quality systems. During such inspections, FDA investigators may review the data and information supporting our PMA applications or may review the procedures and systems used to design or manufacture the device that is the subject of the PMA application. The FDA may indicate areas where additional data or information is necessary, or areas where corrective or preventive actions should be implemented. We may need to expend significant time and resources in responding to such FDA requests, and depending on the nature of the requests, we may not be able to provide the data or information or implement the actions that the FDA believes are necessary.\nClass II medical devices must obtain FDA clearance of a premarket notification, or 510(k), prior to marketing, unless the FDA has exempted the device from this requirement. Under the 510(k) process, we must demonstrate that our test is substantially equivalent in technological characteristics and intended use to a legally-marketed predicate device. The FDA\u2019s review and clearance of a 510(k) usually takes from four to twelve months, but it can take longer. Any modifications to an FDA-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new 510(k) clearance or, if the modified device is not substantially equivalent, possibly a de novo classification request or a PMA.\nIf we are unable to identify an appropriate predicate that is substantially equivalent to our device, we would be required to submit a PMA application or a de novo reclassification request, because devices that have not been classified are automatically categorized as Class III. Under the de novo process, we may request that the FDA classify a new low or moderate risk device that lacks an appropriate predicate as a Class I or Class II device. The de novo process typically requires the development of clinical data and usually takes between six to twelve months from the time of submission of the de novo application, but can take longer.\nFor tests that are subject to FDA regulation, if we do not comply with FDA regulatory requirements, we may be subject to enforcement action, which could substantially harm our business.\nAfter approval, devices subject to FDA regulation are required to comply with post-market requirements. Among the requirements, we and our suppliers must comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulations, or QSRs, which set forth requirements for the design and manufacture of devices, including the methods and documentation for the design, control testing, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, storage, and shipping of our devices. Our limited experience complying with these requirements may lead to operational challenges as we increase the scale of our QSR-compliant operations and develop and refine our policies and procedures for evaluating and mitigating issues we encounter with our processes. Further, if there are any modifications made to the manufacturing of our PMA-approved marketed services, a PMA supplement may be required to be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before the modified device may be marketed.\nAdditionally, the FDA medical device reporting, or MDR, regulations require that manufacturers of medical devices report to FDA adverse events when they learn that their devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, and when they become aware that their device has malfunctioned and would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. We may fail to report adverse events and malfunctions of which we become aware within the prescribed timeframe. We may also fail to recognize that we have become aware of a reportable event, especially if it is not reported to us as an adverse event or if the product characteristic that caused the adverse event is removed in time from our products.\nThe FDA has the authority to require the recall of our marketed devices if the FDA finds that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death. In addition, we may voluntarily initiate certain field actions, such as a correction or removal of our products. If a correction or removal is initiated to reduce a health risk posed by our device, or to remedy a violation of the FDCA caused by the device that may present a risk to health, the correction or removal must be reported to the FDA. If the FDA subsequently determines that a report was required for a correction or removal of our products that we did not believe required a report, we could be subject to enforcement actions. A government-mandated recall or voluntary field action by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects, or other deficiencies and issues. Any recalls of our products or enforcement actions could divert managerial and financial resources and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOther post-market requirements include post-approval studies, establishment registration and device listing, and restrictions on advertising and promotion. These requirements could subject our business to further regulatory risks and costs.\nThe FDA enforces the post-market requirements of the FDCA through announced and unannounced inspections. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could require us to expend time and resources to respond to the FDA\u2019s observations and to implement corrective and preventive actions, as appropriate. If we cannot resolve such issues to the satisfaction of the FDA, we may be subject to enforcement actions, including untitled or warning letters, fines, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties. In addition, we could be subject to a recall or seizure of current or future services, operating restrictions, a partial suspension, or a total shutdown of service. Any such enforcement action would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operations.\nHealthcare policy changes, including legislation reforming the United States healthcare system, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAffordable Care Act\nIn March 2010, legislation collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, was enacted in the United States. The ACA, as subsequently amended, made a number of substantial changes in the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among other things, the ACA requires each medical device manufacturer and importer to pay an excise tax equal to 2.3% of the sale price for its taxable medical devices. In 2015, Congress imposed a two-year moratorium on this medical device tax, so that medical device sales during the period between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017 are exempt from the tax. In 2018, Congress extended the moratorium to medical device sales made during the period between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2019. Absent further legislative action, the tax will be automatically reinstated for medical device sales starting on January 1, 2020. If the tax is reinstated, sales of our services that are regulated as medical devices, such as FoundationFocus CDx BRCA or FoundationOne CDx, would be subject to this tax.\nOn April 1, 2013, cuts to the federal budget were implemented, known as sequestration, resulting in a 2% annual cut in Medicare payments for all services, including clinical laboratory testing. Congress has since extended this 2% Medicare sequester through fiscal year 2025. At this time, it remains uncertain how long the cuts will be continued.\nMany CPT procedure codes for molecular pathology tests that we use to bill our services were revised by the American Medical Association, or AMA, effective January 1, 2013. These new CPT codes were developed and implemented for individual genes, or the components of a multi-gene panel. In a final rule for calendar year 2013, CMS announced that it decided to keep the new molecular codes on the CLFS rather than move them to the Physician Fee Schedule. CMS then announced that for 2013, it would price the new codes using a \u201cgap filling\u201d process. Under this approach, CMS referred the CPT codes to the MACs to allow them to determine an appropriate price. CMS then calculated the median of the pricing provided by the MACs to establish and publish a National Limitation Amount, or NLA, by CPT code for 2014.\nIn 2014, the AMA approved and implemented new CPT codes for genomic sequencing-based panel tests in cancer, effective January 1, 2015. In 2015, CMS used a \u201cgap filling\u201d process to price some of these new codes, which involved referring the new codes to the MACs to allow them to determine and submit to CMS an appropriate price. For 2016, CMS established and published an NLA for some of these codes, including the code associated with testing for 5-50 genes as calculated by determining the median price as provided by the MACs for the applicable code. If CMS reduces reimbursement for the CPT codes for individual genes or fails to price favorably multi-gene panel codes upon which commercial payors may base rates, or if commercial payors who often base pricing on Medicare fee schedules reduce non-contracted payment rates below the NLA amounts for CPT codes corresponding to individual genes, mandate use of the sequencing-based panel CPT codes, or decide to stop payment on specific CPT codes altogether, our revenue could be adversely affected. For 2018, CMS established and published an NLA for the CPT code associated with testing for over 51 genes as calculated based on the weighted median of the payment rates for private payors for such code.\nProtecting Access to Medicare Act\nIn April 2014 the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, was enacted into law. Section 216 of PAMA reforms the Medicare payment system for clinical laboratory tests paid through the CLFS. PAMA establishes a market-based payment system for Medicare payment for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests. Under this new methodology, CMS will establish Medicare payment for each test based on the weighted median of the private payor rates for the test. PAMA also creates a new class of test called the Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory Test, or ADLT, defined as a test offered and furnished only by a single laboratory that is not sold for use by a laboratory other than the original developing laboratory and is either a (1) multi-biomarker test of DNA, RNA or proteins with a unique algorithm yielding a single, patient-specific result, (2) test that is cleared or approved by the FDA, or (3) test meeting other similar criteria established by the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services.\nPAMA requires certain clinical laboratories meeting a threshold of Medicare revenues to report private payor rates and corresponding test volumes. We did not meet this threshold during the January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016 data collection period and therefore were not required to report this data in 2017, however, we anticipate that we will be required to report data during future reporting periods. In June 2016, CMS issued the Medicare Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory Tests Payment System Final Rule, or the Final Rule, to implement the laboratory test payment provisions of PAMA. As outlined in the Final Rule, CMS implemented the new payment system on January 1, 2018. CMS has issued sub-regulatory guidance on data collection and reporting and on additional\ntopics, including a list of specific billing codes for which laboratories must report data. CMS is expected to publish additional sub-regulatory guidance describing how PAMA will be implemented, including an application process for ADLTs. Once this guidance is published, it is possible FoundationOne CDx will not meet the requirements for classification as an ADLT or the requirements of the ADLT application process could create delays for us submitting or billing under PAMA. A delay in the issuance of this guidance or the occurrence of classification or application issues created by the guidance, could delay or materially change our approach to commercializing FoundationOne CDx and could negatively affect reimbursement and therefore revenue. Depending upon if and how commercial payors adopt, or are otherwise influenced by, this new Medicare pricing methodology and the payment rates, our average commercial payor rate for our tests, including FoundationOne CDx, could be adversely affected.\nThe Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation announced in June 2016 the launch of the Oncology Care Model, or OCM, beginning on July 1, 2016. The OCM is a five-year voluntary program that includes 192 physician practices in 32 states, as well as 14 private payors. Under the OCM, participating practices receive performance based payments on the basis of how their prices for 6-month \u201cepisodes\u201d of cancer care triggered by receipt of chemotherapy compare to \u201cbenchmark\u201d prices for similar episodes. These benchmarks are based on the historical data for the period of January 2012 through June 2015. The model may impact the utilization of our tests among those practices participating in OCM.\nMedicare 14-Day Rule\nCertain Medicare billing policy requirements for clinical laboratory tests impact our ability to bill Medicare directly, and under certain circumstances, requires us to bill and collect payments from hospitals for tests that we perform for inpatient or outpatient Medicare patients. Prior to January 1, 2018, under the so-called \u201c14-Day Rule,\u201d tests performed on specimens collected from hospital inpatients or outpatients, where those tests are ordered less than 14 days following the date of the patient's discharge from the hospital, could not be billed by us to Medicare directly; instead we had to bill the hospital for the test.\nIn November 2017, CMS finalized the 2018 Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System Final Rule, which allowed us to directly bill Medicare more frequently. Specifically, under the revised billing rules, a laboratory that performs molecular pathology tests on specimens collected during a hospital outpatient stay may bill Medicare directly for such tests if the test was performed following a hospital outpatient's discharge from the hospital outpatient department. To the extent these revisions to Medicare\u2019s billing policy permit us to bill Medicare directly for tests previously billed to hospitals under the 14-Day Rule, we will no longer bill hospitals for such tests. We continue to be subject to the 14-Day Rule, however, insofar as we perform tests on specimens collected during a hospital inpatient stay. Hospitals may assert that they are not required to pay these bills, or they may delay in paying these bills. In these cases, for hospitals who disclaim responsibility for our bills or delay payment of our bills under the 14-Day Rule, we may undertake collection activities, and as a result of such efforts, we may accept payments from hospitals that are less than the original invoice or we may be unable to collect from hospitals any payments at all.\nFinally, the recent presidential and congressional elections in the U.S. could result in significant changes in, and uncertainty with respect to, legislation, regulation and government policy that could significantly impact our business and the healthcare industry. While it is not possible to predict whether and when any such changes will occur, a variety of initiatives to repeal or significantly reform key provisions of the ACA have been introduced in Congress or otherwise proposed. Most notably, Congress enacted legislation in 2017 that eliminates the ACA\u2019s \u201cindividual mandate\u201d beginning in 2019, which may significantly impact the number of covered lives participating in exchange plans. Other potentially significant changes in policy include the possibility of modifications and elimination of programs and reductions in staffing at the FDA and CMS, and initiatives to contain or reduce governmental spending in the healthcare area, including Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. We cannot predict what future healthcare initiatives will be introduced or implemented at the federal or state level, or how any future legislation or regulation may affect us. Any taxes imposed by federal legislation and the expansion of the government\u2019s role in the U.S. healthcare industry generally, as well as changes to the reimbursement amounts paid by payors for our existing and future services, may reduce our profits and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIf we fail to comply with the complex federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that apply to our business, we could suffer severe consequences that could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to CLIA, a federal law that regulates clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease. CLIA regulations mandate specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance, and inspections. Our laboratory facilities located in the United States each have a current certificate of accreditation under CLIA to conduct our genomic analyses through our accreditation by the College of American Pathologists, or CAP. To renew these certificates, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years. Moreover, CLIA inspectors may make unannounced inspections of our clinical reference laboratories at any time.\nAny sanction imposed under CLIA, its implementing regulations, or state or foreign laws or regulations governing licensure, or our failure to renew a CLIA certificate, a state or foreign license, or accreditation, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Most CLIA deficiencies are not classified as \u201ccondition-level\u201d deficiencies, and there are no adverse effects upon the laboratory operations as long as the deficiencies are corrected. Remediation of these deficiencies are routine matters, with corrections\noccurring within several hours or weeks. More serious CLIA deficiencies could rise to the level of \u201ccondition-level\u201d deficiencies, and CMS has the authority to impose a wide range of sanctions, including revocation of the CLIA certification along with a bar on the ownership or operation of a CLIA certified laboratory by any owners or operators of the deficient laboratory. There is an administrative hearing procedure that can be pursued by the laboratory in the event of imposition of such sanctions, during which the sanctions are stayed, but the process can take a number of years to complete. If we were to lose our CLIA certification or CAP accreditation, we would not be able to operate our clinical laboratories and perform our molecular tests, which would result in material harm to our business and results of operations.\nWe are also required to maintain a license for our Massachusetts laboratory facility to perform testing in Massachusetts. Massachusetts laws establish standards for day-to-day operation of our clinical laboratory, including the training and skills required of personnel and quality control over and above that required by CLIA. We are also licensed to perform testing in our Massachusetts laboratory facility by the states of California, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Florida, Rhode Island, and New York, where we have received a permit from the New York State Department of Health to perform FoundationOne, FoundationOneHeme, and FoundationACT testing and deliver the related test report for specimens originating from New York.\nOur North Carolina laboratory facility became commercially operational in September 2016 and currently conducts limited testing activities. We are currently working towards adding additional services that will be conducted at this facility in the future. We have obtained the necessary licensure for the activities currently performed at this facility and are in the process of obtaining additional licensure to allow for expansion of services provided, when required. If, after acquiring laboratory licenses for our Massachusetts and North Carolina facilities, we do not maintain these licenses or if our approvals are revoked, our business would suffer. In addition, other states may adopt similar licensure requirements in the future.\nWe will become subject to additional regulations in foreign jurisdictions as we and Roche expand international distribution of our services and seek to expand clinical laboratory operations outside the United States. International regulation may require prior review or approval of our services, may impose limits on the export of tissue, data or personal information necessary for us to perform our tests, and, as we establish laboratory operations outside the United States, may require us to obtain licenses and other operating permits. This additional regulation may affect our ability to provide our services and to conduct laboratory operations outside of the United States. If we are unable to comply with existing laws and regulations or changes to the laws and regulations, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are also subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, under which the Department of Health and Human Services established comprehensive federal standards with respect to the privacy and security of protected health information and requirements for the use of certain standardized electronic transactions; certain of our services, including our online customer-facing portals for reporting and research, are subject to these standards and requirements. Amendments to HIPAA under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or the HITECH Act, and related regulatory amendments, which strengthen and expand HIPAA privacy and security standards, increase penalties for violators, extend enforcement authority to state attorneys general, and impose requirements for breach notification.\nWe furnish to biopharmaceutical partners and academic researchers genomic information that has been de-identified in accordance with HIPAA and relevant international health information privacy regulations. We may also furnish our biopharmaceutical partners and academic researchers with identifiable genomic information for research purposes, so long as such disclosure has been approved by an institutional review board or other ethical or privacy review board. The laws of certain states and countries may require specific consent from the individual either to retain or utilize certain genetic information for research or other purposes even if such information has been de-identified, or may require that we obtain a waiver of such consent from an ethical or privacy review board. Even where we furnish to biopharmaceutical partners and academic researchers genomic information that has been de-identified in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, biopharmaceutical partners or academic researchers may use technology or other methods to link that de-identified genomic information to the patient from whom it was obtained in contravention of one or more applicable laws and regulations. Similarly, as we expand our decision support applications and offerings, such as FoundationSmartTrials, we may encounter greater regulatory risk, such as compliance with HIPAA and other regulations governing the use of protected health information and the promotion of FDA-approved drugs. A finding that we have failed to comply with any such laws and any remedial activities required to ensure compliance with such laws could cause us to incur substantial costs, to be subject to unfavorable publicity or public opinion, to change our business practices, or to limit the retention or use of genetic information in a manner that, individually or collectively, could be adverse to our business.\nIn addition to CLIA and HIPAA, our operations are subject to other extensive federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, all of which are subject to change. These laws and regulations currently include, among others:\n\u2022\nFDA laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal healthcare program;\n\u2022\nthe federal Stark physician self-referral law, which prohibits a physician from making a referral for certain designated\nhealth services covered by a federal healthcare program, including laboratory and pathology services, if the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship with the entity providing the designated health services, unless the financial relationship falls within an applicable exception to the prohibition;\n\u2022\nthe federal False Claims Act, which imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government;\n\u2022\nthe federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or other federal or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or other federal or state healthcare program, unless an exception applies;\n\u2022\nother federal and state fraud and abuse laws, such as anti-kickback laws, prohibitions on self-referral, fee-splitting restrictions, prohibitions on the provision of services at no or discounted cost to induce physician or patient adoption, and false claims acts, which may extend to services reimbursable by any third-party payor, including private insurers;\n\u2022\nthe prohibition on reassignment of Medicare clinical laboratory claims, which, subject to certain exceptions, precludes the reassignment of such Medicare claims to any other party;\n\u2022\nthe rules regarding billing for diagnostic tests reimbursable by the Medicare program, which in certain circumstances prohibit laboratories from charging the Medicare program directly for services provided to hospital inpatients and outpatients, and also prohibit a physician or other supplier from marking up the price of the technical component or professional component of certain diagnostic tests ordered by the physician or other supplier and supervised or performed by a physician who does not \u201cshare a practice\u201d with the billing physician or supplier;\n\u2022\nstate laws regulating genetic testing and protecting the privacy of genetic test results, as well as state laws protecting the privacy and security of health information and personal data and mandating reporting of breaches to affected individuals and state regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nstate laws that prohibit other specified practices, such as billing physicians for testing that they order; waiving coinsurance, copayments, deductibles, and other amounts owed by patients; and billing a state Medicaid program at a price that is higher than what is charged to one or more other payors;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires medical device manufactures to track and report to the federal government certain payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws regulating lobbying activities, including the disclosure of payments made in connection with such activities; and\n\u2022\nsimilar foreign laws and regulations that apply to us in the countries in which we operate.\nOur failure to comply could lead to civil or criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, or prohibitions or restrictions on our ability to conduct commercial activities. We believe that we are in material compliance with all statutory and regulatory requirements, but there is a risk that one or more government agencies could take a contrary position. These laws and regulations are complex and are subject to interpretation by the courts and by government agencies. If one or more such agencies allege that we may be in violation of any of these requirements, regardless of the outcome, it could damage our reputation and adversely affect important business relationships with third parties, including managed care organizations and other commercial third-party payors.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about, and promotional activities related to, prescription services and medical devices. If we are found to have improperly promoted our services or devices, we may become subject to significant fines and other liabilities.\nOur molecular information services include a report to physicians that describes the tested cancer\u2019s genomic alterations and, based on peer-reviewed literature and a government-sponsored list of clinical trials (clinicaltrials.gov), matches them with FDA-approved therapies or open clinical trials for therapies targeting cancers driven by those alterations. Our PMA-approved FoundationOne CDx device, in addition to companion diagnostic information, provides information that can be used for patient management according to professional guidelines and clinical trials. In some cases, the therapies identified in our report are not approved for the patient\u2019s cancer or disease state.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription drug and devices. In particular, a device may not be promoted for uses or indications beyond those contained in the device\u2019s approved labeling, or \u201coff-label\u201d uses. If the FDA determines that we have promoted our products for off-label use, it could request that we modify those promotional materials or take regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities may take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use. If not successfully defended, enforcement actions related to off-label promotion could result in significant fines or penalties. The U.S. government has levied large\ncivil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has entered into corporate integrity agreements and deferred prosecution agreements with companies that engaged in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that such companies enter into consent decrees and has taken other enforcement action. If the United States Department of Justice, or DOJ, or FDA determines that we have engaged in off-label promotion in our test reports by providing information regarding approved therapies, we may be subject to civil or criminal fines. Although our policy is to refrain from statements that could be considered off-label promotion of our products, the regulatory standards regarding off-label promotion are ambiguous, and the FDA or another regulatory agency could conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion.\nIn addition to promoting our devices in a manner consistent with their approved indications, we must have adequate substantiation for the claims we make for our devices or services. If any of our claims are determined to be false, misleading or deceptive, our devices or services could be considered to be misbranded under the FDCA or to violate the Federal Trade Commission Act. We could also face lawsuits from our competitors under the Lanham Act alleging that our marketing materials are false or misleading. Such lawsuits, whether with or without merit, are typically time-consuming, costly to defend, and could harm our reputation.\nFederal and state legislation regulate interactions between medical device manufacturers and healthcare professionals. We are subject to federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in healthcare, including anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, and other laws constraining or otherwise related to financial arrangements manufacturers may enter into with healthcare professionals. For example, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires device manufacturers to report and disclose payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals. Violations of these laws can result in criminal or civil sanctions, including, fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, all of which could materially harm our business. We may also be required to comply with HIPAA and similar state laws.\nIn addition, incentives exist under applicable laws that encourage competitors, employees, and physicians to report violations of law governing promotional activities for pharmaceutical and device services. These incentives could lead to so-called whistleblower lawsuits as part of which such persons seek to collect a portion of monies allegedly overbilled to government agencies due to, for example, promotion of pharmaceutical or device services beyond labeled claims. These incentives could also lead to lawsuits that we have mischaracterized a competitor\u2019s service in the marketplace and, as a result, we could be sued for alleged damages to our competitors. Such lawsuits, whether with or without merit, are typically time-consuming and costly to defend. Such lawsuits may also result in related stockholder lawsuits, which are also costly to defend, or Congressional scrutiny.\nFurther, a federal law known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires medical device manufacturers to track and report to the federal government certain payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers must report data for the previous calendar year by the 90th day of the then-current calendar year. CMS then publishes the data on a publicly available website no later than June 30th. There are also state \u201csunshine\u201d laws that require manufacturers to provide reports to state governments on pricing and marketing information. Several states have enacted legislation requiring medical device manufacturers to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales and marketing activities, and such laws may also prohibit or limit certain other sales and marketing practices. These laws may adversely affect our sales, marketing, and other activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. If we fail to track and report as required by these laws or to otherwise comply with these laws, we could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.\nWe may be subject to fines, penalties, licensure requirements, or legal liability, if it is determined that through our test reports we are practicing medicine without a license.\nOur test reports delivered to physicians provide information regarding FDA-approved therapies and clinical trials that oncologists may use in making treatment decisions for their patients. We make members of our organization available to discuss the information provided in the reports. State laws prohibit the practice of medicine without a license. Our customer service representatives and medical affairs team provide support to our customers, including assistance in interpreting the test report results. A governmental authority or individual actor could allege that the identification of available therapies and clinical trials in our reports and the related customer service we provide constitute the practice of medicine. A state may seek to have us discontinue the inclusion of certain aspects of our test reports or the related services we provide, or subject us to fines, penalties, or licensure requirements. Any determination that we are practicing medicine without a license may result in significant liability to us.\nIf the validity of an informed consent from a patient enrolled in a clinical trial with one of our biopharmaceutical partners was challenged, we could be forced to stop using some of our resources, which would hinder our molecular information service development efforts.\nWe provide services, including molecular testing, to our biopharmaceutical partners in connection with clinical trials. We have implemented measures to ensure that all clinical data and genetic and other biological samples that we receive in connection with clinical trials from our biopharmaceutical partners have been collected from subjects who have provided appropriate informed consent for purposes which extend to our service development activities. We seek to ensure that data and samples are provided to us on a subject de-identified manner.\nWe also act as a sponsor of clinical trials in connection with data analyses we perform, which are frequently conducted in collaboration with biopharmaceutical partners. We seek and receive approval from an ethical review board, or Institutional Review Board, for projects that meet the definition of \u201chuman subjects research,\u201d which includes review and approval of processes for subject informed consent and authorization for use of personal information or waivers thereof.\nIn all our clinical trial-related activities, we also have measures in place to ensure that the subjects from whom the data and samples are collected do not retain or have conferred on them any proprietary or commercial rights to the data or any discoveries derived from them. Our biopharmaceutical partners conduct clinical trials in a number of different countries, and, to a large extent, and particularly when we are acting as a vendor in connection with a project sponsored by our biopharmaceutical partners, we rely upon them to comply with the subject\u2019s informed consent and with applicable local laws and international regulations. The collection of data and samples in many different countries results in complex legal questions regarding the adequacy of informed consent and the status of genetic material under a large number of different legal systems. The subject\u2019s informed consent obtained in any particular country could be challenged in the future, and those informed consents could prove invalid, unlawful, or otherwise inadequate for our purposes. Any findings against us, or our biopharmaceutical partners, could deny us access to or force us to stop using some of our clinical data or samples, which would hinder our molecular information service development efforts. We could become involved in legal challenges, which could consume our management and financial resources.\nIf we or our biopharmaceutical partners experience any of a number of possible unforeseen events in connection with clinical trials, our ability to conduct further clinical trials of, obtain regulatory approval of, or commercialize future services or improvements to existing services, could be delayed or prevented.\nWe or our biopharmaceutical partners may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to conduct further clinical trials or obtain regulatory approval of or commercialize future services or improvements to existing services. Unforeseen events that could delay or prevent our ability to conduct or support clinical trials, obtain regulatory approval of or commercialize future services, or improvements to existing services include:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities or ethical review boards, including IRBs, may not authorize us, our investigators or our biopharmaceutical partners to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u2022\nwe may have delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites;\n\u2022\nclinical trials of our future services candidates, or improvements to our existing services, may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulatory authorities may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon development programs of our services;\n\u2022\nthe number of patients, or amount of data, required for clinical trials of our future service or services candidates, or improvements to our existing services, may be larger than we anticipate, patient enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate or patients may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nour failure to conduct our clinical trials in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements of the FDA and of the regulatory authorities responsible for oversight of the conduct of clinical trials in other countries;\n\u2022\nwe are unable to develop additional companion diagnostic tests or add additional companion diagnostic claims to existing tests, and/or obtain regulatory approval to market any such test on a timely basis, or at all;\n\u2022\nthe therapeutic agents that we are developing companion diagnostic tests for may be associated with negative or inconclusive results in clinical trials, and our biopharmaceutical partners may decide to deprioritize or abandon these therapeutic agent programs, or regulatory authorities may require them to abandon these therapeutic agent programs or impose onerous changes or requirements, which could lead to de-prioritization or abandonment by the biopharmaceutical partner;\n\u2022\nclinical trials of our biopharmaceutical partners\u2019 therapeutic agents that we are developing companion diagnostic tests for may suggest or demonstrate that these therapeutic agents are not as efficacious and/or as safe as other similar therapeutic agents or a companion diagnostic test is not essential to determine which patients would benefit from these therapeutic agents;\n\u2022\nwe may decide, or regulatory authorities or institutional review boards may require us, or our investigators, or our biopharmaceutical partners, to suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\na finding that the patients are being exposed to unacceptable risks to their health or the privacy of their health information being disclosed associated with our future services candidates, or improvements to our existing services;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical trials of future services candidates, or improvements to our existing services, may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nwe may not have sufficient capacity in our laboratories to perform testing as requested or volumes or with the requested turnaround times; and\n\u2022\nthe supply or quality of materials or data necessary to conduct clinical trials of future services candidates, or improvements to our existing services, may be insufficient or inadequate.\nEthical, legal, and social concerns related to the use of genomic information could reduce demand for our molecular information services.\nGenomic testing, like that conducted using our molecular information platform and services, has raised ethical, legal, and social issues regarding privacy and the appropriate uses of the resulting information. Governmental authorities could, for social or other purposes, limit or regulate the use of genomic information or genomic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions, particularly for those that have no known cure. Similarly, these concerns may lead patients to refuse to use genomic tests even if permissible.\nEthical and social concerns may also influence United States and foreign patent offices and courts with regard to patent protection for technology relevant to our business. These and other ethical, legal, and social concerns may limit market acceptance of our services or reduce the potential markets for services enabled by our molecular information platform, either of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIntellectual Property Risks Related to Our Business\nLitigation or other proceedings or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from selling our services or impact our stock price.\nThird parties have asserted and may in the future assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. As we continue to commercialize our molecular information services in their current or updated forms, launch new services, and enter new markets, we expect that competitors will claim that our services infringe their intellectual property rights as part of business strategies designed to impede our successful commercialization and entry into new markets. We occasionally receive letters from third parties inviting us to take licenses under, or alleging that we infringe, their patents, and, in some instances, have become involved in patent litigation. Third parties may have obtained, and may in the future obtain, patents under which such third parties may claim that the use of our technologies constitutes patent infringement.\nWe could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against claims of this nature. Any adverse ruling or perception of an adverse ruling in defending ourselves against such claims could have a material adverse impact on our cash position and stock price. Furthermore, parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief, which could block our ability to develop, commercialize, and sell services, and could result in the award of substantial damages against us. In the event of a successful claim of infringement or misappropriation against us, we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties, or be prohibited from selling certain services, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our cash position and business and financial condition.\nIn addition, we may be unable to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost, if at all. We could, therefore, incur substantial costs related to royalty payments for licenses obtained from third parties, which could negatively affect our gross margins. Moreover, we could encounter delays in introducing new services while we attempt to develop alternative methods or services. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses on favorable terms could prevent us from commercializing services, and the prohibition of sale of any of our services would materially affect our ability to grow and maintain profitability and have a material adverse impact on our business.\nDevelopments in patent law could have a negative impact on our business.\nFrom time to time, the United States Supreme Court, or the Supreme Court, other federal courts, the United States Congress, or the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, may change the standards of patentability and any such changes could have a negative impact on our business.\nDiagnostic method claims and \u201cgene patents\u201d were considered in two landmark Supreme Court cases, Mayo Collaborative v. Prometheus Laboratories, or Prometheus, and Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, or Myriad. In Prometheus, a case involving patent claims directed to optimizing the amount of drug administered to a specific patient, Prometheus\u2019 claims failed to incorporate sufficient inventive content above and beyond mere underlying natural correlations to allow the claimed processes to qualify as patent-eligible processes that apply natural laws. In Myriad, a case brought by multiple plaintiffs challenging the validity of patent claims held by Myriad Genetics, Inc. relating to the breast cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, the court held that isolated genomic DNA that exists in nature, such as the DNA constituting the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, is not patentable subject matter, but that cDNA, which is an artificial construct created from RNA transcripts of genes, may be patent eligible. The Federal Circuit has begun to apply the holdings in Prometheus and Myriad. In 2015, the Federal Circuit, in Ariosa v. Sequenom, applying Prometheus, found claims to a prenatal diagnostic method that relied on a natural product to be patent ineligible, and clarified that the absence of preemption of a natural phenomenon was not sufficient to demonstrate patent eligibility. In 2016, the Federal Circuit, in Rapid Litigation Management v. CellzDirect, found claims to a method of preserving liver cells to be patent-eligible.\nIn response to the Supreme Court decisions in Prometheus, Myriad, and Alice Corporation Pty. Ltd. V. CLS Bank International, or Alice Corp., and others, the USPTO has updated the Manual of Patent Examination Procedure (MPEP) to provide guidance to USPTO personnel in examining patent claims reciting judicially recognized exceptions to patentable subject matter, including laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas, for patent eligibility. The USPTO guidance indicates that claims reciting a judicial exception to patent-eligible subject matter must amount to significantly more than the judicial exception itself in order to be patent-eligible subject matter. We cannot assure you that our efforts to seek patent protection for our technology and services will not be negatively impacted by this interim guidance issued by the USPTO, the decisions described above, rulings in other cases, or changes in guidance or procedures issued by the USPTO.\nWe cannot fully predict what impact the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Prometheus, Myriad, Alice Corp., and other decisions may have on the ability of biopharmaceutical companies or other entities to obtain or enforce patents relating to DNA, genes, or genomic-related discoveries in the future. Despite the USPTO interim guidance and Federal Circuit cases described above, the contours of when claims reciting laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas may meet the patent eligibility requirements are not clear and may take years to develop via interpretation at the USPTO and in the courts. There are many previously issued patents claiming nucleic acids and diagnostic methods based on natural correlations that issued before the recent Supreme Court decisions discussed, and although many of these patents may be invalid under the standards set forth in the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions, until successfully challenged, these patents are presumed valid and enforceable, and certain third parties could allege that we infringe, or request that we obtain a license to, these patents. Whether based on patents issued prior to or after these Supreme Court decisions, we could have to defend ourselves against claims of patent infringement, or choose to license rights, if available, under patents claiming such methods. In particular, although the Supreme Court has held in Myriad that isolated genomic DNA is not patent-eligible subject matter, certain third parties could allege that activities that we may undertake infringe other classes of gene-related patent claims, and we could have to defend ourselves against these claims by asserting non-infringement and/or invalidity positions, or pay to obtain a license to these claims. In any of the foregoing or in other situations involving third-party intellectual property rights, if we are unsuccessful in defending against claims of patent infringement, we could be forced to pay damages or be subjected to an injunction that would prevent us from utilizing the patented subject matter in question if we are unable to obtain a license on reasonable terms. Such outcomes could materially affect our ability to offer our services and have a material adverse impact on our business. Even if we are able to obtain a license or successfully defend against claims of patent infringement, the cost and distraction associated with the defense or settlement of these claims could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe may be unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property effectively, which could harm our competitive position.\nObtaining and maintaining a strong patent position is important to our business. A number of our patent applications are in the early stages of prosecution. Patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is complex and uncertain, so we cannot be assured that we will be able to obtain or maintain patent rights, or that the patent rights we may obtain will be valuable, provide an effective barrier to competitors or otherwise provide competitive advantages. Others have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications that are similar or identical to ours or those of our licensors. To determine the priority of inventions, or demonstrate that we did not derive our invention from another individual or entity, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO or in court that could result in substantial costs in legal fees and could substantially affect the scope of our patent protection. We cannot be assured our patent applications will prevail over those filed by others. Also, our intellectual property rights may be subject to other challenges by third parties. Patents we obtain could be challenged in litigation or in administrative proceedings such as ex parte reexam, inter partes review, or post-grant review in the United States or opposition proceedings in Europe or other jurisdictions.\nObtaining and maintaining a patent portfolio entails significant expense and resources. Part of the expense includes periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees, various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications due in several stages over the lifetime of patents and/or applications, as well as the cost associated with complying with numerous procedural provisions during the patent application process. We may or may not choose to pursue or maintain protection for particular inventions. In addition, there are situations in which failure to make certain payments or noncompliance with certain requirements in the patent process can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we choose to forego patent protection or allow a patent application or patent to lapse purposefully or inadvertently, our competitive position could suffer.\nLegal actions to enforce our patent rights can be expensive and may involve the diversion of significant management time. In addition, these legal actions could be unsuccessful and could also result in the invalidation of our patents, a narrow construction of the scope of our patents, or a finding that they are unenforceable. We may or may not choose to pursue litigation or interferences against those that have infringed our patents, due to the associated expense and time commitment of monitoring these activities. If we fail to protect or to enforce our intellectual property rights successfully, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, know-how, and other confidential and proprietary information, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to patent protection, we also rely upon copyright and trade secret protection, as well as non-disclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties, to protect our confidential and proprietary information. For example, significant elements of some of our tests, including aspects of sample preparation, computational-biological algorithms, and related processes and software, are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how that are not publicly disclosed. In addition to contractual measures, we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using physical and technological security measures. Such measures may not, for example, in the case of misappropriation of intellectual rights by an employee, consultant, or third party with authorized access, provide adequate protection for our proprietary information. Our security measures may not prevent an employee, consultant, or third party from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor, and recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated intellectual property can be difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Due to variation in the degree of protection afforded to intellectual property of this nature under the laws and regulations applicable to different international markets where our services are sold under our Ex-U.S. Commercialization Agreement with Roche, our ability to pursue and obtain an adequate remedy may depend significantly on the jurisdiction in which the misconduct takes place and our ability to enforce a favorable judgment against the offending party in a jurisdiction in which such party has substantial assets. In addition, trade secrets may be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us. If any of our confidential or proprietary information, such as our trade secrets, were to be disclosed or misappropriated, or if any such information were independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to enforce our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly, we may face an increased risk in these jurisdictions that unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use our trademarks, copyrights, formulations or other intellectual property. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Specifically, the legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to biotechnology. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents, if obtained, or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit. Patent protection must ultimately be sought on a country-by-country basis, which is an expensive and time-consuming process with uncertain outcomes. Accordingly, we may choose not to seek patent protection in certain countries, and we will not have the benefit of patent protection in such countries.\nMonitoring infringement and misappropriation of intellectual property can be difficult and expensive, and we may not be able to detect every instance of infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights. Even if we do detect infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights, proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain adequate protection for our technology and the enforcement of intellectual property.\nThird parties may assert ownership or commercial rights to inventions we develop.\nThird parties may in the future make claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our intellectual property. For example, we rely on certain third parties to provide us with tissue samples and biological materials that we use to conduct our genomic analyses. We have written agreements with collaborators that provide for the ownership of intellectual property arising from our collaborations. These agreements provide that we must negotiate certain commercial rights with collaborators with respect to joint inventions or inventions made by our collaborators that arise from the results of the collaboration. In some instances, there may not be adequate written provisions to address clearly the resolution of intellectual property rights that may arise from a collaboration. If we cannot successfully negotiate sufficient ownership and commercial rights to the inventions that result from our use of a third-party collaborator\u2019s materials where required, or if disputes otherwise arise with respect to the intellectual property developed with the use of a collaborator\u2019s samples, we may be limited in our ability to capitalize on the market potential of these inventions. In addition, we may face claims that our agreements with employees, contractors, or consultants obligating them to assign intellectual property to us are ineffective, or in conflict with prior or competing contractual obligations of assignment, which could result in ownership disputes regarding intellectual property we have developed or will develop and interfere with our ability to capture the commercial value of such inventions. Litigation may be necessary to resolve an ownership dispute, and if we are not successful, we may be precluded from using certain intellectual property, or may lose our exclusive rights in that intellectual property. Either outcome could have an adverse impact on our business.\nThird parties may assert that our employees or consultants have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information or misappropriated trade secrets.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other diagnostic or biopharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees and consultants do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of a former employer or other third parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with Roche\nWe may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of our broad strategic collaboration with Roche or realize them in the expected time frame.\nImplementation of the collaboration agreements, the Roche Credit Facility, and related corporate governance agreements with Roche may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships, and diversion of management\u2019s attention, including, among others:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated business objectives, opportunities and growth prospects;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing the expanded operations of a more complex company;\n\u2022\nchallenges related to adhering to our obligations to repurchase shares pursuant to Roche\u2019s anti-dilution protections contained in the Investor Rights Agreement;\n\u2022\nour ability to comply with the covenants set forth in the Roche Credit Facility;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining our independence, and the perception of our independence, due to Roche\u2019s beneficial ownership of our stock, the broad strategic collaboration, the Roche Credit Facility and as a result of our employing individuals who were previously employed by Roche, including our recent appointment of Troy Cox as Chief Executive Officer, who previously worked for Genentech, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Roche;\n\u2022\nchallenges resulting from increased complexities in accounting and tax matters related to our obligations under the Investor Rights Agreement and Tax Sharing Agreement by and between us and Roche, dated January 11, 2015, or the Tax Sharing Agreement, including our compliance with certain financial, accounting and tax reporting obligations, practices and procedures;\n\u2022\nchallenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers, including any biopharmaceutical customers that are actual or potential competitors with Roche;\n\u2022\nchallenges in our relationships with collaboration partners, suppliers, and patients; and\n\u2022\nchallenges in attracting and retaining key personnel that may arise from working in a more complex company or due to changes in our equity incentive program that we adopted to maintain Roche\u2019s percentage ownership interest pursuant to our obligations under the Investor Rights Agreement.\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control, and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if the full benefits of our relationship with Roche are realized, including the sales and growth opportunities that are expected, these benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in connection with the relationship. All of these factors could negatively impact the price of our common stock. As a result, we cannot assure you that our relationship with Roche will result in the realization of the anticipated benefits.\nAs long as Roche owns greater than a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock, other holders of our common stock may have limited ability to affect the outcome of certain matters requiring stockholder approval and Roche\u2019s interest may conflict with ours and other stockholders\u2019.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Roche owned approximately 57.5% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, until such time as Roche holds shares representing less, and potentially a material portion less, than a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of our outstanding common stock at a stockholder meeting, Roche generally will have the ability to control the outcome of any matter submitted for the vote of our stockholders, except in certain circumstances set forth in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and the Investor Rights Agreement.\nThe interests of Roche may not coincide with the interests of our other stockholders. Roche\u2019s ability, subject to the limitations in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and the Investor Rights Agreement, to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval limits the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our minority stockholders do not view as beneficial. As a result, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the existence of a majority stockholder could discourage third parties from acquiring us since the third party would be required to negotiate any such transaction with Roche, and the interests of Roche with respect to such transaction may be different from the interests of our other stockholders. In particular, it is possible that our minority stockholders may not receive a control premium for their shares upon any eventual sale of our business.\nIn addition, the standstill provision in the Investor Rights Agreement, which prohibits Roche from acquiring shares of our stock, terminates in April 2018. Speculation about the possibility of future actions Roche may take in connection with us, and the performance of Roche generally, may create significant volatility or otherwise adversely affect our share price.\nWe have entered into contractual provisions that may significantly limit our ability to undertake certain business opportunities, conduct certain operations, raise capital or require us to make material expenditures.\nPursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, until such time as Roche and its affiliates beneficially own less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock (subject to a cure period), we may not take certain actions without Roche\u2019s prior written consent, including any of the following: (a) appoint a new Chief Executive Officer; (b) incur any indebtedness (as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) that would result in the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the indebtedness of us and our subsidiaries exceeding the lesser of (A) $200 million and (B) 20% of our aggregate market capitalization at the time of such incurrence; (c) issue or sell any equity securities (including any securities convertible or exercisable into such equity securities), other than (X) common stock issued upon the exercise or settlement of equity awards granted as of the date of the Investor Rights Agreement in accordance with their terms, (Y) equity awards granted after the date of the Investor Rights Agreement pursuant to our 2013 Stock Option and Incentive Plan or any permitted new equity incentive plan or equity incentive plan amendment, and (Z) in connection with permitted acquisitions, certain shares of our common stock issued as stock consideration as long as such issuance does not result in Roche beneficially owning less than 50.5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock on a fully diluted basis; (d) establish or amend any of our equity incentive plans, except for certain permitted equity incentive plans and permitted equity incentive plan amendments; (e) acquire any entity, business or assets if the aggregate consideration payable by us exceeds the lesser of (X) $200 million and (Y) 20% of our aggregate market capitalization at the time of such transaction, unless Roche is separately contemplating acquiring the same entity, business or assets; (f) dispose of any entity, business or assets if the aggregate consideration payable to us exceeds $50 million; (g) change the scope and nature of our business; (h) amend our organizational documents; (i) take any action that would impair in any material respect our ability to perform our obligations under the Investor Rights Agreement or Roche\u2019s rights thereunder; or (j) voluntarily dissolve or liquidate or make any voluntary bankruptcy filings. Our Board or management team could believe that taking any one of these actions would be in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. As such, if we are unable to complete any of these actions because Roche does not provide its consent, it could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nThe Investor Rights Agreement also requires us to establish and maintain a stock repurchase program and to repurchase shares of our common stock in order to maintain Roche\u2019s aggregate percentage ownership at no less than 50.5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock on a fully diluted basis, less any shares transferred by Roche. Our obligation to maintain such stock repurchase program may involve material expenditures of cash by us. If we fail to or are unable to satisfy our repurchase obligations under the stock repurchase program and we issue any securities and, as a result thereof, Roche beneficially owns less than 50.1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock on a fully diluted basis, the restrictions on Roche under the Investor Rights Agreement (including with respect to the agreement to vote Roche\u2019s shares of common stock, the standstill restrictions and the transfer restrictions), but not the rights of Roche under the Investor Rights Agreement, will immediately terminate, and Roche will thereafter have the ability to exercise in full its rights as a stockholder.\nIn addition, the Transaction Agreement by and between us and Roche Holdings, Inc., dated January 11, 2015, or the Transaction Agreement, provides for us to indemnify Roche for breaches of the Transaction Agreement by us subject to negotiated limitations. If we are required to indemnify Roche for any such breaches, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nRoche\u2019s majority ownership of us and contractual restrictions on their ability to purchase and sell our common stock could have a material negative impact on the liquidity of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Roche owned approximately 57.5% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, under the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, until April 2018, Roche is restricted from acquiring additional shares, except in order to offset dilution and maintain its aggregate percentage ownership in us at no less than 50.5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock on a fully diluted basis. The Investor Rights Agreement also requires us to establish a stock repurchase program designed to maintain Roche\u2019s percentage ownership interest in our common stock. This ownership and these provisions will likely result in a less liquid trading market for our shares. Even when the standstill provision in the Investor Rights expires in April 2018, there can be no assurance that Roche will purchase shares of our stock. This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult for investors to transact in our shares and the price of our stock may suffer as a result.\nThe independent members of our Board, who are not our employees and are not Roche designees, do not represent a majority of our Board.\nWe have determined that the directors designated by Roche, who represent a minority on our Board, Troy Cox, our Chief Executive Officer, and Michael J. Pellini, M.D., our former Chief Executive Officer and current Chairman of the Board, are not independent directors under Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2). The other five members of our ten-person Board are independent under Nasdaq Rule 5605(a)(2), and therefore do not constitute a majority. NASDAQ Rule 5605(b) requires that a majority of the board of directors of NASDAQ listed companies be comprised of independent directors. However, due to Roche\u2019s majority ownership of our stock, we currently rely upon the \u201cControlled Company\u201d exemption (as set forth in Nasdaq Rule 5615(c)(2)) from the majority Board independence requirement of Nasdaq Rule 5605(b). As a result of our reliance on the \u201cControlled Company\u201d exemption, the perception of us as an independent entity could be diminished and our business could be harmed.\nPursuant to our agreements with Roche, certain development and commercialization decisions for our services are determined by Roche and we do not retain full control, which presents a number of risks including, among others:\n\u2022\nRoche may conduct multiple service development efforts within areas that are the subject of our collaboration with Roche, and Roche may develop, either alone or with others, services in related fields that are competitive with the current and future services that are the subject of our collaboration with Roche. Competing services, either developed by Roche, or to which Roche has rights, may result in withdrawal of or reduction in Roche\u2019s support for our programs or services, or otherwise impair the development, marketability and commercialization of our services;\n\u2022\nCollaborations often require the parties to cooperate, and failure to do so effectively could adversely affect or result in the termination or delay of development, regulatory approval or sales of our services, or result in litigation or arbitration;\n\u2022\nRoche\u2019s interests may not always be aligned with our interests, and Roche may not market our services in the same manner or to the same extent that we would or on the time schedule we currently contemplate, which could adversely affect our business;\n\u2022\nIf our interests come into conflict with those of Roche, Roche may choose to act in its self-interest, which may limit our ability to implement our strategies or result in delays and other obstacles in the development or commercialization of our current and future services;\n\u2022\nRoche will have control and broad discretion over certain aspects of the commercialization of our services in its territory, and we will have little, if any, influence on how this commercialization will be conducted. This lack of control could cause delays or other difficulties, which may prevent us from receiving any royalty, milestone or other payments, or limit such payments, with respect to such commercialization;\n\u2022\nRoche may be unable to successfully commercialize our services in its territory, which would negatively impact our revenues and our strategy to develop these services;\n\u2022\nAny failure by Roche to comply with applicable laws and regulatory requirements in the marketing, sale and maintenance of regulatory approvals of our services could adversely affect our revenues or give rise to legal proceedings in which we would be involved;\n\u2022\nRoche has certain rights to terminate our agreements with them. If Roche terminates one or more of our agreements, the actual milestone, royalty and other payments that we receive under these agreements may be lower than expected, our ability to generate revenue under such agreements could be delayed or could cease entirely and our business and results of operations could be materially impacted; and\n\u2022\nThere is no guarantee that the various milestone events set forth in our agreements with Roche will be achieved. To the extent we or Roche do not succeed in developing and commercializing our services, or if we or Roche fail to achieve such milestones, our revenues under these agreements will be limited.\nThese risks introduce considerable uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative efforts with Roche. If these efforts fail, our service development or commercialization of new and existing services in various territories could be delayed, and revenues from our current and future services could be adversely affected.\nThe Roche Credit Facility contains restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nIn July 2017, we entered into an amendment, or the Credit Facility Amendment, to our secured credit facility agreement with Roche Finance, an affiliate of Roche, as amended, the Roche Credit Facility. As amended by the Credit Facility Amendment, we may borrow up to $200 million under the Roche Credit Facility. The Roche Credit Facility is secured by a lien on all of our assets, including shares of our subsidiaries, our intellectual property, insurance, trade and intercompany receivables, inventory and equipment and contract rights. The Roche Credit Facility requires us to meet specified minimum cash requirements and contains various affirmative and negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nsell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of certain assets;\n\u2022\nacquire another company or business or enter into a merger or similar transaction with third parties;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness, subject to customary exceptions;\n\u2022\nencumber or permit liens on certain assets; and\n\u2022\npay dividends on our common stock.\nOur Board or management team could believe that taking any one of these actions would be in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. As such, if we are unable to complete any of these actions because Roche Finance does not provide its consent, it could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nIn the event of a default, including, among other things, our failure to make any payment when due or our failure to comply with any provision of the Roche Credit Facility, Roche Finance could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we are unable to repay those amounts, Roche Finance could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness.\nRoche Finance\u2019s interests as a lender may not always be aligned with our interests, or with Roche\u2019s interests as a stockholder. If our interests come into conflict with those of Roche Finance, including in the event of a default under the Roche Credit Facility, Roche Finance may choose to act in its self-interest, which could adversely affect the success of our current and future collaborative efforts with Roche.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe have a history of net losses. We expect to incur net losses in the future and we may never achieve sustained profitability.\nWe have historically incurred substantial net losses, including a net loss of $161.5 million in 2017. From our inception in 2009 through December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $506.3 million. We expect our losses to continue as a result of not being broadly contracted with commercial payors, ongoing research and development expenses and increased selling and marketing costs. These losses have had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on our working capital, total assets, and stockholders\u2019 equity. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our research, development, and commercialization efforts, we are unable to predict when we will become profitable, and we may never become profitable. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our inability to achieve and then maintain profitability would negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may need to raise additional capital to fund our existing operations, develop our molecular information platform, commercialize new services, and expand our operations.\nIf our available cash balances, available borrowings under the Roche Credit Facility, and anticipated cash flow from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements, including because of lower demand for our services as a result of lower than currently expected rates of reimbursement from commercial third-party payors and government payors or other risks described in this Annual Report, we may seek to sell common or preferred equity or convertible debt securities, enter into another credit facility or another form of third-party funding, or seek other debt financing.\nWe may consider raising additional capital in the future to expand our business, to pursue strategic investments, to take advantage of financing opportunities, or for other reasons, including to:\n\u2022\nincrease our sales and marketing efforts to drive market adoption of our services and address competitive developments;\n\u2022\nfund development and marketing efforts of any future services;\n\u2022\nfurther expand our laboratory operations domestically and outside of the United States;\n\u2022\nexpand our technologies into other types of cancers;\n\u2022\nacquire, license or invest in technologies, including information technologies;\n\u2022\nacquire or invest in complementary businesses or assets; and\n\u2022\nfinance capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses.\nOur present and future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to achieve revenue growth;\n\u2022\nour rate of progress in establishing reimbursement arrangements with domestic and international commercial third-party payors and government payors;\n\u2022\nthe cost of expanding our laboratory operations and offerings, including our sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nour rate of progress in, and cost of the sales and marketing activities associated with, establishing adoption of and reimbursement for our services;\n\u2022\nour rate of progress in, and cost of research and development activities associated with, services in research and early development;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022\ncosts related to international expansion; and\n\u2022\nthe potential cost of and delays in research and development as a result of any regulatory oversight applicable to our services.\nThe various ways we could raise additional capital carry potential risks and are, in certain cases as set forth in the Investor Rights Agreement and Roche Credit Facility, subject to the prior consent of Roche. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to our stockholders could result. Any equity securities issued also could provide for rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. If we raise funds by issuing debt securities, those debt securities would have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. The terms of debt securities issued or borrowings pursuant to a credit agreement, like the Roche Credit Facility, could impose significant restrictions on our operations. If we raise funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our platform technologies or services, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nAdditional equity or debt financing might not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. If we cannot secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more research and development programs or sales and marketing initiatives. In addition, we may have to work with a partner on one or more of our development programs, which could lower the economic value of those programs to us. Lastly, if we are unable to obtain the requisite amount of financing needed to fund our planned operations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and ability to continue operating as a going concern.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management devotes substantial time to public company compliance programs.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses due to our compliance with regulations and disclosure obligations applicable to us, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and the NASDAQ Stock Market, or NASDAQ. The SEC and other regulatory authorities have continued to adopt new rules and regulations and make additional changes to existing regulations that require our compliance. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that have required the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas. Stockholder activism, the current political environment, and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact, in ways we cannot currently anticipate, the manner in which we operate our business. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance programs and monitoring of public company reporting obligations, and as a result of the new corporate governance and executive compensation related rules, regulations, and guidelines prompted by the Dodd-Frank Act, and further regulations and disclosure obligations expected in the future, we will likely need to devote additional time and costs to comply with such compliance programs and rules. These rules and regulations will cause us to incur significant legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nTo comply with the requirements of being a public company, we may need to undertake various actions, including implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring new accounting or internal audit staff. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate, and weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which we may be required to include in our periodic reports we file with the SEC under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, or result in a restatement of our prior period financial statements. In the event that we are not able to demonstrate compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, that our internal control over financial reporting is perceived as inadequate, or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our operating results, and the price of our common stock could decline.\nWe are required to comply with certain of the SEC rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment needs to include the disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by our management or our independent registered public accounting firm. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or if we are unable to complete our evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the first annual report required to be filed with the SEC following the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, which we expect to occur in our annual report for the year ended December 31, 2018. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls in the future. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nIn addition, adherence to our obligations to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to Roche\u2019s anti-dilution protections in the Investor Rights Agreement may be costly and require substantial resources and efforts. Furthermore, adherence to our other obligations under the Investor Rights Agreement and the Tax Sharing Agreement, including our compliance with certain financial, accounting and tax reporting obligations, may be costly and time-consuming, require substantial resources and efforts, and result in changes to our existing business practices.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to annual limitations on its ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income or reduce taxes. In 2015, we completed a Section 382 analysis and believe we experienced one or more ownership changes in our corporate history, within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code, including in connection with our transaction with Roche that closed in April 2015; accordingly, our pre-change NOLs are subject to certain annual limitations under Section 382. Future changes in our stock ownership could result in additional ownership changes under Section 382 of the Code further limiting our ability to utilize our NOLs. Furthermore, our ability to use NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. For these reasons, we may not be able to use a material portion of the NOLs even if we attain profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe expect that our stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, an active public market for our common stock may not be sustained, among other reasons, due to the ownership of a majority of our outstanding stock by Roche and contractual restrictions set forth in the Investor Rights Agreement on Roche\u2019s and our ability to transact our shares.\nIn addition, the market price of shares of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many risk factors listed in this section, and others beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\ncompetition from existing services or new services that may emerge;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us, our biopharmaceutical partners, or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations, or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed financial estimates and projections of the investment community or that we provide to the public and the revision of any financial estimates and projections that we provide to the public;\n\u2022\nissuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u2022\nadditions, transitions or departures of key management or scientific personnel;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nchanges to reimbursement levels by commercial third-party payors and government payors, including Medicare, and any announcements relating to reimbursement levels;\n\u2022\nannouncement or expectation of additional debt or equity financing efforts;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us, our insiders, or our other stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe perception of us in the marketplace as an independent entity;\n\u2022\nthe performance of Roche or speculation about the possibility of future actions Roche may take in connection with us; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nThese and other market and industry factors may cause the market price and demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, regardless of our actual operating performance, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of our common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In addition, the stock market in general, and NASDAQ and biopharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. In the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. If any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us, we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit. Such a lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and will be able to avail ourselves of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we are electing not to take advantage of such extended transition period, and as a result we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to not take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on any of the exemptions available under the JOBS Act. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion or more; (ii) December 31, 2018; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock, the Roche Credit Facility prohibits the payment of dividends, and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our common stock will likely depend on whether the price of our common stock increases.\nWe have not paid dividends on any of our classes of capital stock to date, the Roche Credit Facility prohibits the payment of dividends and we currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Consequently, in the foreseeable future, you will likely only experience a gain from your investment in our common stock if the price of our common stock increases.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts. The price of our common stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our common stock or if they issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business.\nOur relationship with Roche and anti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Roche beneficially owned approximately 57.5% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, until such time as Roche and its affiliates hold shares representing less, and potentially a material portion less, than a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of our outstanding common stock at a stockholder meeting, Roche generally will have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted for the vote of our stockholders related to a proposed takeover attempt. In addition, pursuant to the Roche Credit Facility, a \u201cChange in Control\u201d is considered to be an \u201cEvent of Default\u201d which triggers the acceleration of all unpaid indebtedness under the Roche Credit Facility. The existence of a majority stockholder and the acceleration of the repayment of the indebtedness under the Roche Credit Facility could discourage third parties from acquiring our business since the third party would be required to negotiate any such transaction with Roche, and the interests of Roche with respect to such transaction may be\ndifferent from the interests of our other stockholders. In particular, it is possible that our minority stockholders may not receive a control premium for their shares upon any eventual sale of our business.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions which could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our Board. Our corporate governance documents include provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorizing \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our Board without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022\nlimiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings;\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our Board;\n\u2022\ncontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of Board and stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nproviding our Board with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings and to cancel previously scheduled special meetings.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock.\nAny provision of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of our certificate of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are recently the subject of securities litigation, which could result in substantial costs and may divert our management\u2019s attention.\nFrom time to time, we are a party to litigation arising in the ordinary course of its business. As of December 31, 2017, we were not currently a party to any significant litigation. On July 28, 2017, a purported stockholder of the Company filed a putative class action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, against the Company and certain of its current and former executives, captioned Mahoney v. Foundation Medicine, Inc., et al., No. 1:17-cv-11394. The complaint alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder based on allegedly false and misleading statements when providing 2015 financial guidance. The lawsuit seeks among other things, unspecified compensatory damages in connection with the Company\u2019s allegedly inflated stock price between February 26, 2014 and November 3, 2015, interest, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, and unspecified equitable/injunctive relief. On December 22, 2017, the plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder based on allegedly false and misleading statements concerning certain of the Company\u2019s tests. On February 20, 2018, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. We believe this case is without merit and, therefore, continue to vigorously defend ourselves against the allegations.", "PERMNO": 14160, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "FMI"}
