RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment in our common stock. The risks described below are not the only ones we face in our business. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed. In such an event, our common stock could decline in price and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nOur results and financial condition are affected by global and local market conditions, and competitors\u2019 pricing strategies, which can adversely affect our sales, margins, and net income.\nOur results of operations can be affected by local, national and worldwide market conditions. The consequences of domestic and international economic uncertainty or instability, volatility in commodity markets, and domestic or international policy uncertainty, all of which we have seen, can all impact economic activity. Unfavorable conditions can depress the demand for our products and thus sales in a given market and may prompt competitor\u2019s pricing strategies that adversely affect our margins or constrain our operating flexibility. Certain macroeconomic events, such as the past crisis in the financial markets, could have a more wide-ranging and prolonged impact on the general business environment, which could also adversely affect us. Whether we can manage these risks effectively depends mainly on the following:\n\u2022\nOur ability to manage movements in commodity prices and the impact of government actions to manage national economic conditions such as consumer spending, inflation rates and unemployment levels, particularly given the past volatility in the global financial markets; and\n\u2022\nThe impact on our margins of labor costs given our labor-intensive business model, the trend toward higher wages in both mature and developing markets and the potential impact of union organizing efforts on day-to-day operations of our manufacturing facilities.\nThe terms and conditions of our credit facility impose certain restrictions on our operations. We may not be able to raise additional capital, if needed, for proposed expansion projects.\nThe terms and conditions of our credit facility impose certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, make capital expenditures, acquisitions and asset dispositions, as well as impose other customary covenants, such as requiring that our fixed charge coverage ratio not be less than 1.25:1.00 and our total leverage ratio not exceed 3.00:1:00. Our ability to comply with the covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, such as distressed and volatile financial and/or consumer markets, etc. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit facility. In the event of a default, the bank could elect to declare the outstanding principal amount of our credit facility, all interest thereon, and all other amounts payable under our credit facility to be immediately due and payable. As of February 28, 2017, we were in compliance with all terms and conditions of our credit facility, which matures on August 11, 2020 and have cash on hand in excess of 2.7 times our current outstanding debt level.\nDeclining financial market conditions and continued decline in long-term interest rates could adversely impact the funded status of our pension plan.\nWe maintain a noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan (the \u201cPension Plan\u201d) covering approximately 8% of our employees. Included in our financial results are Pension Plan costs that are measured using actuarial valuations. The actuarial assumptions used may differ from actual results. In addition, as our Pension Plan assets are invested in marketable securities, severe fluctuations in market values could potentially negatively impact our funded status, recorded pension liability, and future required minimum contribution levels. In addition, a decline in long-term debt interest rates puts downward pressure on the discount rate used by plan sponsors to determine their pension liabilities. Each 10 basis point change in the discount rate impacts our computed liability by about $900,000. Similar to fluctuations in market values, a drop in the discount rate could potentially negatively impact our funded status, recorded pension liability and future contribution levels. In addition, continued changes in the mortality tables could potentially impact our funded status.\nWe may be required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets, which could cause our financial condition and results of operations to be negatively affected in the future.\nWhen we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition may be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The amount of the purchase price which is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable tangible assets acquired. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. An impairment may be caused by any number of factors outside our control, such as a decline in market conditions caused by a recession, or protracted recovery there-from, or other factors like competitor\u2019s pricing strategies, which may be tied to such economic events. Though to date, we have not been required to take an impairment charge relating to our print business, continued sale-side pressures due to technology transference, competitor pricing pressures, and economic uncertainties could result in a determination that a portion of the recorded value of goodwill and intangible assets may be required to be written down. Although such a charge would be a non-cash expense, it would impact our reported operating results and financial position. At February 28, 2017, our consolidated goodwill and other intangible assets were approximately $70.6 million and $53.9 million, respectively.\nDigital technologies will continue to erode the demand for our printed business documents.\nThe increasing sophistication of software, internet technologies, and digital equipment combined with our customers\u2019 general preference, as well as governmental influences for paperless business environments will continue to reduce the number of traditional printed documents sold. Moreover, the documents that will continue to coexist with software applications will likely contain less value-added print content.\nMany of our custom-printed documents help companies control their internal business processes and facilitate the flow of information. These applications will increasingly be conducted over the internet or through other electronic payment systems. The predominant method of our customers\u2019 communication to their customers is by printed information. As their customers become more accepting of internet communications, our clients may increasingly opt for what is perceived to be less costly electronic option, which would reduce our revenue. The pace of these trends is difficult to predict. These factors will tend to reduce the industry-wide demand for printed documents and require us to gain market share to maintain or increase our current level of print-based revenue which could place pressure on our operating margins.\nIn response to the gradual obsolescence of our standardized forms business, we continue to develop our capability to provide custom and full-color products. If new printing capabilities and new product introductions do not continue to offset the obsolescence of our standardized business forms products, and we aren\u2019t able to increase our market share, our sales and profits will be affected. Decreases in sales of our standardized business forms and products due to obsolescence could also reduce our gross margins or impact the value of our recorded goodwill and intangible assets. This reduction could in turn adversely impact our profits, unless we are able to offset the reduction through the introduction of new high margin products and services or realize cost savings in other areas.\nOur distributor customers may be acquired by other manufacturers who redirect business within their plants.\nSome of our customers are being absorbed by the distribution channels of some of our manufacturing competitors. However, we do not believe this will significantly impact our business model. We have continued to sell to some of these customers even after they were absorbed by our competition because of the breadth of our product line and our geographic diversity.\nOur distributors face increased competition from various sources, such as office supply superstores. Increased competition may require us to reduce prices or to offer other incentives in order to enable our distributors to attract new customers and retain existing customers.\nLow price, high value office supply chain stores offer standardized business forms, checks and related products. Because of their size, these superstores have the buying power to offer many of these products at competitive prices. These superstores also offer the convenience of \u201cone-stop\u201d shopping for a broad array of office supplies that our distributors do not offer. In addition, superstores have the financial strength to reduce prices or increase promotional\ndiscounts to expand market share. This could result in us reducing our prices or offering incentives in order to enable our distributors to attract new customers and retain existing customers, which could reduce our profits.\nTechnological improvements may reduce our competitive advantage over some of our competitors, which could reduce our profits.\nImprovements in the cost and quality of printing technology are enabling some of our competitors to gain access to products of complex design and functionality at competitive costs. Increased competition from these competitors could force us to reduce our prices in order to attract and retain customers, which could reduce our profits.\nWe could experience labor disputes that could disrupt our business in the future.\nAs of February 28, 2017, approximately 9% of our employees are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements, which are subject to periodic negotiations. While we feel we have a good working relationship with all of the unions, there can be no assurance that any future labor negotiations will prove successful, which may result in a significant increase in the cost of labor, or may break down and result in the disruption of our business or operations.\nWe obtain our raw materials from a limited number of suppliers, and any disruption in our relationships with these suppliers, or any substantial increase in the price of raw materials or material shortages could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe purchase our paper products from a limited number of sources, which meet stringent quality and on-time delivery standards under long-term contracts. However, fluctuations in the quality of our paper, unexpected price changes or other factors that relate to our paper products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nPaper is a commodity that is subject to periodic increases or decreases in price, which are sometimes quite significant. There is no effective market of derivative instruments to cost-effectively insulate us against unexpected changes in price of paper, and corporate negotiated purchase contracts provide only limited protection against price increases. Generally, when paper prices are increased, we attempt to recover the higher costs by raising the prices of our products to our customers. In the price-competitive marketplaces in which we operate, we may not always be able to pass through any or all of the higher costs. As such, any significant increase in the price of paper or shortages in its availability, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Lately, paper pricing has been decreasing due to excess domestic capacity and the abundance of cheap foreign paper. This availability of cheap foreign paper allows smaller competitors to be able more competitive in the marketplace which tends to put more pressure on selling prices and operating margins.\nWe face intense competition to gain market share, which may lead some competitors to sell substantial amounts of goods at prices against which we cannot profitably compete.\nOur marketing strategy is to differentiate ourselves by providing quality service and quality products to our customers. Even if this strategy is successful, the results may be offset by reductions in demand or price declines due to competitors\u2019 pricing strategies or other micro or macro-economic factors. We face the risk of our competition following a strategy of selling its products at or below cost in order to cover some amount of fixed costs, especially in stressed economic times.\nEnvironmental regulations may impact our future operating results.\nWe are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and foreign laws and regulations establishing health and environmental quality standards, concerning, among other things, wastewater discharges, air emissions and solid waste disposal, and may be subject to liability or penalties for violations of those standards. We are also subject to laws and regulations governing remediation of contamination at facilities currently or formerly owned or operated by us or to which we have sent hazardous substances or wastes for treatment, recycling or disposal. We may be subject to future liabilities or obligations as a result of new or more stringent interpretations of existing laws and regulations. In addition, we may have liabilities or obligations in the future if we discover any environmental contamination or liability at any of our facilities, or at facilities we may acquire.\nWe are exposed to the risk of non-payment by our customers on a significant amount of our sales.\nOur extension of credit involves considerable judgment and is based on an evaluation of each customer\u2019s financial condition and payment history. We monitor our credit risk exposure by periodically obtaining credit reports and updated financials on our customers. We generally see a heightened amount of bankruptcies by our customers during economic downturns. While we maintain an allowance for doubtful receivables for potential credit losses based upon our historical trends and other available information, in times of economic turmoil, there is heightened risk that our historical indicators may prove to be inaccurate. The inability to collect on sales to significant customers or a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business incurs significant freight and transportation costs.\nWe incur transportation expenses to ship our products to our customers. Significant increases in the costs of freight and transportation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, as there can be no assurance that we could pass on these increased costs to our customers.\nWe depend upon the talents and contributions of a limited number of individuals, many of whom would be difficult to replace.\nThe loss or interruption of the services of our Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President or Chief Financial Officer could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Although we maintain employment agreements with these individuals, it cannot be assured that the services of such individuals will continue.\nIncreases in the cost of employee benefits could impact our financial results and cash flow.\nOur expenses relating to employee health benefits are significant. Unfavorable changes in the cost of such benefits could impact our financial results and cash flow. Healthcare costs have risen significantly in recent years, and recent legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform could result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. While new healthcare reform is currently being discussed in Washington, we cannot predict with any assurance if it will in fact be passed and what the impact that such Reform could have on the Company-sponsored medical plans. While the Company has various cost controls measures in place and employs outsight and outside cost reviews on larger claims, this has been and is expected to continue to be a significant cost to the Company. As seen during the fiscal year 2017, the Company incurred additional medical costs in excess of that anticipated. As such, effective with the start of calendar year 2017, the Company made changes to its medical reimbursement program. While the initial indications are promising, as we are still in the early phases of this program, it is too early to tell whether or not these changes will be successful in stemming the rising trend-line of the Company\u2019s medical costs.", "PERMNO": 47511, "SIC": 2761, "TIC": "EBF"}
