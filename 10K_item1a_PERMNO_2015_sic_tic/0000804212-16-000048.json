Although our diverse product offering and customer base help provide some stability to our business in difficult times, a broad decline in general economic conditions or changes in other external factors including the price of commodities, such as crude oil, could result in customers postponing capital projects and could negatively impact the demand for our products and services as well as our customers\u2019 ability to fulfill their obligations to us. The impact of a strong U.S. dollar could give rise to higher imports and reduce production activity for domestic customers that export, thereby reducing demand for our products. In addition, falling demand could lead to lower sales volumes, lower pricing and/or lower profit margins. It could also impact our ability to fulfill our volume purchase obligations under take-or-pay supply agreements, resulting in lower profit margins. A protracted period of lower product demand and profitability could result in diminished values for both tangible and intangible assets, increasing the possibility of future impairment charges. Further, suppliers could be impacted by an economic downturn, which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. If economic conditions deteriorate, our operating profit, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by gas supply disruptions and supply/demand imbalances.\nWe are one of the nation\u2019s leading suppliers of industrial, medical and specialty gases and have supply contracts with the major gas producers. Additionally, we operate 17 air separation units, 11 acetylene plants and eight liquid carbon dioxide production facilities, which provide us with substantial production capacity. Our supply contracts and our own production capacity mitigate supply disruptions to various degrees. However, natural disasters, plant shut-downs, labor strikes and other supply disruptions may occur within our industry. Regional supply disruptions may create shortages of raw materials and certain products. Consequently, we may not be able to obtain the products required to meet our customers\u2019 demands or may incur significant costs to ship product from other regions of the country to meet customer requirements. Such additional costs may adversely impact operating results until product sourcing can be restored. When we experience supply shortages, we work to meet customer demand by arranging for alternative supplies and transporting product into an affected region, but we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in arranging alternative product supplies or passing the additional transportation or other costs on to customers in the event of future supply disruptions, which could negatively impact our operations, financial results or liquidity.\nInterruptions in the proper functioning of our information systems could disrupt business and operational activities.\nWe rely on information systems for business and operational activities, including the processing and storage of proprietary and sensitive information. These systems are susceptible to disruptions as a result of events such as fires, natural disasters, hardware and software failures, network outages, power disruptions, and other problems. Although we maintain data center and network resiliency and recovery capabilities for our critical systems, interruptions in the proper functioning of these systems could adversely impact our ability to process orders, shipments, inventory receipts, vendor payments, and accounts receivable collections - any of which could negatively impact our operations or financial results.\nBreaches of our information systems and e-Business platform could adversely impact our reputation, disrupt operations, and result in increased costs and loss of revenue.\nInformation security risks and threats have increased in recent years as a result of the interconnectedness of the systems, networks, and e-Business platform used to conduct business with our customers, suppliers and other third parties. Our business is also subject to complex and evolving U.S. and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection and other matters. Despite maintaining and continuously improving our technologies and processes to mitigate these risks and comply with laws and regulations, sophisticated cyberattacks and security breaches could compromise our systems and data. Such events could expose us to reputational damage, business disruptions, regulatory and legal actions, and claims from customers,\nsuppliers, financial institutions, and employees - any of which could have a material adverse impact to our financial condition and results of operations.\nCatastrophic events and operating failures may disrupt our business and adversely affect our operating results.\nAlthough our operations are widely distributed across the U.S., and safety is a primary focus in all we do, we manage and distribute hazardous materials and a catastrophic event could result in significant property losses, injuries and third-party claims. Examples of such events include, but are not limited to, the following: a fire, explosion or release of hazardous materials at one of our facilities, a supplier\u2019s facility or a customer\u2019s facility; a natural disaster, such as a hurricane, tornado or earthquake; and an operating failure at one of our facilities or in connection with the delivery of our products. Additionally, such events may severely impact our regional customer base and supply sources resulting in lost revenues, higher product costs and increased bad debts.\nOperational and execution risks may adversely impact our financial results.\nOur operating results are reliant on the continued operation of our production and distribution facilities and delivery fleet, as well as our ability to meet customer requirements. Inherent in our operations are risks that require continuous oversight and control, such as risks related to mechanical failure, fire, explosion, toxic releases and vehicle accidents. We have policies, procedures and safety protocols in place requiring continuous training, oversight and control in order to address these risks to our operations. However, significant operating failures at our production, distribution or storage facilities, or vehicle transportation accidents, could result in loss of life, loss of production or distribution capabilities, and/or damage to the environment, thereby adversely impacting our operations and financial results. These factors could subject us to lost sales, litigation contingencies and reputational risk.\nU.S. credit markets may impact our ability to obtain financing or increase the cost of future financing.\nAs of March 31, 2016, we had total consolidated debt of approximately $2.6 billion, which had an average length to maturity of approximately four years and includes $250 million of long-term debt obligations maturing during the year ending March 31, 2017. During periods of volatility and disruption in the U.S. credit markets, obtaining additional or replacement financing may be more difficult and costly. Higher cost of new debt may limit our ability to finance future acquisitions on terms that are acceptable to us. Additionally, although we actively manage our interest rate risk through the use of diversified debt obligations and occasional derivative instruments, approximately 30% of our debt has a variable interest rate. If interest rates increase, our interest expense could increase, affecting earnings and reducing cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions. Based on our outstanding borrowings at March 31, 2016, for every 25 basis point increase in our average variable borrowing rates, we estimate that our annual interest expense would increase by approximately $2.0 million.\nFinally, our cost of borrowing can be affected by debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based in large part on our performance as measured by certain liquidity metrics. An adverse change in these debt ratings could increase the cost of borrowing and make it more difficult to obtain financing on favorable terms.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment and such competition could negatively impact us.\nThe U.S. industrial gas industry operates in a highly competitive environment. Competition is generally based on price, reliable product delivery, product availability, technical support, quality and service. If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, we may suffer lower revenue and/or a loss of customers, which could result in lower profits and adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows.\nVolatility in product and energy costs could reduce our profitability.\nThe cost of industrial gases represents a significant percentage of our operating costs. The production of industrial gases requires significant amounts of electricity. Therefore, industrial gas prices have historically increased as the cost of electricity increases. Unforeseen increases in power fuel costs, namely natural gas prices and to a degree oil, can result in unanticipated higher electric prices and operating costs. Severe weather conditions can adversely impact both our sales and expenses, causing an impediment to fully and timely recoup such unanticipated costs from our customers. In addition, a significant portion of our product distribution expenses consists of fuel costs. Energy prices can be volatile and may rise in the future, resulting in an increase in the distribution costs of industrial gases. While we have historically been able to pass increases in operating expenses on to our customers, we cannot guarantee our ability to do so in the future, which could negatively impact our operations, financial results or liquidity.\nWe may not be successful in integrating acquisitions and achieving intended benefits and synergies.\nWe have successfully integrated approximately 480 acquisitions in our history and consider the acquisition and integration of businesses to be a core competency. However, the process of integrating acquired businesses into our operations may result in unexpected operating difficulties and may require significant financial and other resources. Unexpected\ndifficulties may impair our ability to achieve targeted synergies or planned operating results, which could diminish the value of acquired tangible and intangible assets resulting in future impairment charges. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nacquired companies may not have internal control structures appropriate for a larger public company, resulting in a need for significant revisions;\n\u2022\nacquired operations, information systems and products may be difficult to integrate;\n\u2022\nacquired operations may not achieve targeted synergies;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to retain key employees, customers and business relationships of acquired companies; and\n\u2022\nour management team may have its attention and resources diverted from ongoing operations.\nWe depend on our key personnel to manage our business effectively and they may be difficult to replace.\nOur performance substantially depends on the efforts and abilities of our senior management team and key employees. Furthermore, much of our competitive advantage is based on the expertise, experience and know-how of our key personnel regarding our distribution infrastructure, systems and products. The loss of key employees could have a negative effect on our business, revenues, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to litigation and reputational risk as a result of the nature of our business, which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time-to-time, we are involved in lawsuits that arise from our business. Litigation may, for example, relate to product liability claims, personal injury, property damage, vehicle accidents, regulatory issues, contract disputes or employment matters. The occurrence of any of these matters could also create possible damage to our reputation and our operations. The defense and ultimate outcome of lawsuits against us may result in higher operating expenses. Higher operating expenses or reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on our business, including to our liquidity, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe have established insurance programs with significant deductibles and maximum coverage limits which could result in the recognition of significant losses.\nWe maintain insurance coverage for workers\u2019 compensation, business automobile and general liability claims with significant per occurrence deductibles. In the past, we have incurred significant workers\u2019 compensation, business automobile and general liability losses. Such losses could impact our profitability. Additionally, claims in excess of our insurance limits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation relating to health, safety and environmental matters, as well as anti-corruption laws that generate ongoing compliance costs and could subject us to liability.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations relating to health, safety and the protection of the environment and natural resources, as well as regulations related to social policy. These include, among other things, reporting on chemical inventories and risk management plans, and management of hazardous substances and wastes, air emissions and water discharges. More recently, we have examined our supply chain with respect to certain products we manufacture or contract to manufacture as a result of new regulations around the use of conflict minerals. Violations of existing laws and enactment of future legislation and regulations could result in substantial penalties, temporary or permanent plant closures, restrictions on our operations caused by the temporary or permanent loss of our licenses and other legal consequences, as well as reputational and other risks. Moreover, the nature of our existing and historical operations exposes us to the risk of liabilities to third parties. These potential claims include property damage, personal injuries and cleanup obligations.\nThe issue of greenhouse gas emissions has been subject to increased scrutiny and public awareness, and may result in legislation, both internationally and in the U.S., to reduce its effects. Increased regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could impose additional costs on us, both directly through new compliance and reporting requirements as well as indirectly through increased industrial gas and energy costs. Until such time as any new legislation is passed, it will remain unclear as to what industries would be impacted, the period of time within which compliance would be required, the significance of the greenhouse gas emissions reductions and the costs of compliance. Although we do not believe that increased greenhouse gas emissions regulation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, we cannot provide assurance that such costs will not increase in the future or will not become material.\nAlthough our operations are predominantly in the United States, we conduct operations internationally in Canada, Mexico, Russia, Dubai and several European countries. Our international operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-corruption laws of the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We maintain policies and procedures designed to comply with anti-corruption laws.\nHowever, there can be no guarantee that these policies and procedures will effectively prevent violations by our employees or representatives in the future.\nRisk Factors Related to the Merger\nThe proposed Merger may not be completed on a timely basis, or at all, and the failure to complete the Merger could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock.\nOn November 17, 2015, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Air Liquide and the Merger Sub. Completion of the Merger is subject to various conditions, including the receipt of necessary antitrust and regulatory approvals. Failure to complete the Merger could adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock in a number of ways, including the following:\n\u2022\nIf the Merger is not completed, and there are no other parties willing and able to acquire the Company for consideration that is equivalent or more attractive than that in the Merger Agreement, on terms acceptable to us, our stock price may decline.\n\u2022\nWe have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed Merger, for which we will have received little or no benefit if the Merger is not completed. Many of these fees and costs will be payable by us even if the Merger is not completed and may relate to activities that we would not have undertaken other than to complete the Merger.\nThe prospective Merger could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe prospective Merger could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding our ongoing business operations, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, regardless of whether the Merger is completed. These risks to our business include the following, all of which could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of the Merger:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of significant management time and resources towards the completion of the Merger;\n\u2022\nthe impairment of our ability to retain and hire key personnel, including our senior management;\n\u2022\ndifficulties maintaining relationships with customers, suppliers and others with whom we conduct business;\n\u2022\nthe impairment of our ability to execute on our strategy of growth through acquisitions; and\n\u2022\npotential litigation relating to the Merger and the costs related thereto.", "PERMNO": 70308, "SIC": 5084, "TIC": "ARG"}
