{"cik": "1528557", "company": "Corindus Vascular Robotics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-18", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nInvesting in our common stock or any other security that may be issued by us involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Report, before making an investment decision. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. In that case, the trading price of our shares of common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. You should read the section entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d above for a discussion of what types of statements are forward-looking statements, as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this Report.\nRisks Related to our Financial Position\nOur net losses and significant cash used in operating activities may hinder our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have incurred losses since inception and have funded our cash flow deficits primarily through the issuance of capital stock and debt. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $215.4 million. As of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $23.8 million and working capital of $22.8 million.\nWe have evaluated whether or not our cash and cash equivalents on hand and the cash proceeds from the financing activities described above would be sufficient to sustain projected operating activities through March 18, 2020 as required by Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 205-40 Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. Based on our current forecast of cash flow deficits we will not have sufficient resources to meet our cash requirements through March 18, 2020.\nWe have considered our plans to alleviate our projected cash deficit at March 18, 2020 and the probability and effectiveness of such plans eliminating our projected cash deficit at March 18, 2020. In the event we do not achieve our year to date plan revenue by the third quarter of 2019 or obtain anticipated financing, we will undertake the following activities to reduce our cash flow deficits:\n\u25cf Eliminate or defer the 2019 discretionary bonus payouts for all bonus eligible employees, including executive management;\n\u25cf Reduce spending on prototypes and clinical trials;\n\u25cf Eliminate planned headcount additions in research and development, marketing and medical affairs;\n\u25cf Defer or limit some or all spending on capital equipment planned for 2019; and\n\u25cf Reduce employee travel and entertainment expenses, external consulting resources and our presence at tradeshows.\nAs we continue to incur losses and cash flow deficits, our transition to profitability is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure, but we will otherwise rely on additional capital funding until such time as that is achieved. We may never achieve profitability, and unless and until doing so, we intend to fund future operations through additional non-dilutive or dilutive financings. There can be no assurances, however, that additional funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nAs we continue to incur losses, our transition to profitability is dependent upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure. We may never achieve profitability, and unless and until doing so, we intend to fund future operations through additional non-dilutive or dilutive financings. There can be no assurances, however, that additional funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nUntil we reach profitability and generate operating cash flows to grow the business, we will need to continue to raise additional funding. We may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs, commercialization efforts and growth strategy.\nWe will need additional funding for establishing and expanding our sales and marketing infrastructure and for future product development and we may be unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe have funded operations primarily through the issuance of capital stock and debt. On May 28, 2015, our Company completed a public offering by issuing 12,650,000 shares of our common stock at $3.80 per share in exchange for proceeds of $44.4 million, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering costs. In March 2017, we completed a private placement of 68,055,700 shares of our common stock at $0.6616 per share in exchange for gross proceeds of approximately $45.0 million, before deducting offering expenses. On March 16, 2018, we closed on a private placement of convertible preferred stock for gross proceeds of $25.0 million. The preferred stock is convertible into an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares of common stock and is entitled to receive non-compounding dividends in additional shares of preferred stock, at the rate of 12.0% per annum, subject to reduction in the event certain milestones are achieved. The preferred stock purchasers were also issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 8,750,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.40 per share, exercisable either for cash or on a cashless basis. Also, on March 16, 2018, we completed a financing arrangement with two lenders which provided for borrowings of up to $26.0 million in the form of up to $23.0 million in term loans and up to a $3.0 million revolving line-of-credit through March 2022. As of December 31, 2018, we had $12.0 million in principal outstanding under the term loan facility and no principal outstanding under the revolving loan facility. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had not achieved the gross profit or equity financing milestones required to draw on the additional $11.0 million that had been available under the term loan. The revolving line-of-credit also has various clauses which restrict its availability and for which we currently do not meet such restrictions. On August 31, 2018, we entered into a Sales Agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC (\u201cCowen\u201d) with respect to an at-the-market offering program under which we may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $30,000,000 (the \u201cPlacement Shares\u201d) through Cowen as our sales agent. Cowen may sell the Placement Shares by any method permitted by law deemed to be an \u201cat the market\u201d offering as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As of December 31, 2018, we have sold 2,569,159 shares of common stock at a weighted average per share price of $1.19 at the market pursuant to the Sales Agreement for $2.7 million in net proceeds.\nIn the first quarter of 2019, we closed a private placement with a large institutional investor and existing stockholders consisting of the sale of 14,384,840 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, at a price of $1.3796 per share, for gross proceeds of approximately $19.8 million and net proceeds of approximately $19.5 million.\nOn March 14, 2019, we amended our financing arrangement with our two lenders to add an additional term loan of $2.8 million, all of which was outstanding principal as of March 14, 2019.\nShould we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders will experience immediate dilution. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. Any additional debt or equity financing that we close may contain terms, such as liquidation and other preferences, which are not favorable to us or our stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If additional financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund expansion, successfully promote our brand name, develop or enhance our services, take advantage of business opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements, any of which could seriously harm our business and reduce the value of your investment.\nThe terms of our term loan facility and revolving credit facility place restrictions on our ability to operate our business and on our financial flexibility, and we may be unable to achieve the milestones necessary for us to incur additional borrowings under the term loan facility or to satisfy the minimum revenue covenants.\nOn March 16, 2018, we completed a financing arrangement with two lenders which provided for borrowings of up to $26.0 million in the form of up to $23.0 million on in term loans and up to a $3.0 million revolving line-of-credit through March 2022. As of December 31, 2018, we had $12.0 million in principal outstanding under the term loan facility and no principal outstanding under the revolving loan facility. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had not achieved the gross profit or equity financing milestones required to draw on the additional $11.0 million that had been available under the term loan. On March 14, 2019, we amended our financing arrangement with our two lenders to add an additional term loan of $2.8 million, all of which was outstanding principal as of March 14, 2019. The revolving line-of-credit also has various clauses which restrict its availability and for which the Company currently does not meet such restrictions. See Note 6 for additional details.\nBoth loan facilities include customary affirmative and negative covenants, which may make it difficult for us to run our business. Upon the earlier of the second advance under the term loan facility or the first advance under the revolving loan facility, we must also achieve minimum revenue on a monthly basis measured against a percentage of our Board of Directors approved projections for the applicable fiscal year. We cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve the minimum revenue requirements provided for in the loan facilities. Our failure to satisfy the revenue, or any other covenant could result in an event of default under the loan facilities. Other events of default include, among other things, our failure to pay principal or interest due, a breach of other covenants under the loan facilities, our insolvency, a material adverse change, the occurrence of any default under certain other indebtedness in an amount greater than $250,000 and judgments against us in an amount greater than $250,000 individually or in the aggregate.\nChanges in our effective tax rate may harm our results of operations.\nA number of factors may harm our future effective tax rates including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf\nthe jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n\u25cf\nthe resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various taxing authorities;\n\u25cf\nchange in valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n\u25cf\nincreases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes;\n\u25cf\nchanges in available tax credits and deductions;\n\u25cf\nchanges in share-based compensation; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause we have incurred losses to date, we have not recorded any income tax provision thus far. At December 31, 2018, we had U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $180.8 million and $103.7 million, respectively, that can be carried forward and offset against future taxable income. The federal net operating loss carryforward will begin to expire in 2028 and the state net operating loss carryforward will begin to expire in 2022.\nUtilization of net operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the \u201cchange in ownership\u201d provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state provisions. This limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization. We have not yet determined whether any changes in ownership have triggered any such limitations. There can be no assurance that we will utilize the entire amount of our net operating loss carryforwards.\nFederal Income Tax Reform could have unforeseen effects on our financial condition and our results of operations and adversely affect our business.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, which contains significant changes to federal income tax law. Among other things, the Tax Act requires complex computations that were not previously provided for under U.S. tax law and significantly revised the U.S. tax code by, among other changes, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, requiring a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creating new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. Our net deferred tax assets and liabilities will be revalued at the newly enacted U.S. corporate rate, and the impact will be recognized in our tax expense in the year of enactment. At December 31, 2018, we have completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. However, additional guidance may be issued by the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, the Department of the Treasury, or other governing body that may significantly differ from our interpretation of the law, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, results of operations or financial conditions. We urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to such legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe are completely dependent on the success of our CorPath System, which has a limited commercial history. If our CorPath System fails to gain or loses market acceptance, our business will suffer.\nDuring 2016, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for our CorPath GRX System, the second-generation of the CorPath System. We commercially introduced our CorPath GRX System in January 2017 and expect that sales of our CorPath GRX System will account for the majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future. Demand for our CorPath GRX System has not increased as quickly as we expected and we do not know if we will be successful over the long term in generating increased demand for the use of our products. Failure of our CorPath GRX System to significantly penetrate current or new markets would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a competitive industry and if our competitors have products that are marketed more effectively or develop products, treatments or procedures that are similar, more advanced, safer or more effective than ours, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated and our business will be harmed.\nOur potential competitors may develop products, treatments or procedures that are similar, more advanced, safer or more effective than ours. The medical device industry is very competitive and subject to significant technological and practice changes. We expect to face competition from many different sources with respect to our existing products and products that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future.\nCompeting against large established competitors with significant resources may make establishing a market for any products that we develop difficult which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Our commercial opportunity could also be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products, treatments or procedures that are safer, more effective, are more convenient or are less expensive than our existing products or any product that we may develop. Many of our potential competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we may have. Mergers and acquisitions in the medical device industry market may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our potential competitors. Smaller and other early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These companies compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.\nHealthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade. There have been and may continue to be proposals by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to keep, contain or reduce healthcare costs.\nThe continuing efforts of governments, insurance companies and other payors of healthcare costs to contain or reduce these costs, combined with closer scrutiny of such costs, could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these third-party payors. The cost containment measures that healthcare providers are instituting both in the U.S. and internationally could harm our business. Some healthcare providers in the U.S. have adopted or are considering a managed care system in which the providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person. Healthcare providers may attempt to control costs by authorizing fewer elective surgical procedures or by requiring the use of the least expensive devices possible, which could adversely affect the demand for our products or the price at which we can sell our products. Some healthcare providers have sought to consolidate and create new companies with greater market power, including hospitals. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide products and services has become and will continue to become more intense. This has resulted and likely will continue to result in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important marketing segments.\nIf institutions or physicians are unable to obtain coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures using our products, or if reimbursement is insufficient to cover the costs of purchasing our products, we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to support our business.\nIn the United States, hospitals generally bill for the services performed with our products to various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs and private insurance plans. Currently, there is no incremental reimbursement provided for robotic-assisted interventional procedures. Therefore, using the CorPath System and consumable cassette without an incremental reimbursement will initially increase the up-front cost of the procedure and the cath lab operation based on the cost of the CorPath System and also consumable cassettes. This lack of incremental reimbursement from third-party payors for procedures performed with our products, or lack of coverage by governmental and private payors\u2019 policies of interventional procedures performed using our products, could deter hospitals from purchasing our products and may make us unable to generate the revenues necessary to support our business.\nThe commercial success of our products will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by hospitals and physicians. Should we not achieve market acceptance, we will not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business.\nThe CorPath System is a new technology that represents a fundamentally new way of performing interventional procedures; however, it competes with established treatment options for these procedures. Achieving physician, patient and third-party payor acceptance of the CorPath System as a preferred method of performing vascular procedures will be crucial to our success. If our products fail to achieve market acceptance, hospital customers will not purchase our products and we will not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business. We believe that acceptance by hospitals, physicians and third-party payors regarding the benefits of procedures performed using our products will be essential for acceptance of our products by patients. Physicians will not recommend the use of our products unless we can demonstrate that they produce results comparable or superior to existing techniques. Even though we have proven the effectiveness of our products through clinical trials, physicians may elect not to use our products for any number of other reasons. For example, physicians may continue to recommend conventional techniques simply because they are already widely accepted. In addition, physicians may be slow to adopt our products because of the perceived liability risks arising from the use of new products and the uncertainty of reimbursement from third-party payors, particularly in light of ongoing health care reform initiatives. We expect that there will be a learning process involved for physicians and their surgical teams to become proficient in the use of our products. Market acceptance could be delayed by the time required to complete this training. We may not be able to rapidly train physicians and their surgical teams in numbers sufficient to generate adequate demand for our products.\nDevelopment and awareness of our brand will largely depend upon our success in increasing our customer base. In order to attract and retain customers and to promote and maintain our brand in response to competitive pressures, management plans to significantly increase our sales and marketing budgets, particularly for our field sales force. If we are unable to economically promote or maintain our brand, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be severely harmed.\nThe successful use of our CorPath System depends in part on physician skill and experience. If we are unable to train physicians on the proper use of our system, we may experience a high risk of product liability.\nThe successful use of our CorPath System depends in part on the physician\u2019s skill and experience. We train users on the proper techniques in using our system to achieve the intended outcome. Because of the acute nature of the procedure, we are unable to have a company representative attend cases using the CorPath System. As the number of users of our system increases, it is possible that the level of training that we are accustomed to providing will be insufficient and some physicians may not be willing to invest the time required to become properly trained with our procedure. We may find that physicians who are less skilled in the use of interventional devices will increasingly use the CorPath System, potentially leading to a higher rate of device failure, injury, negative publicity and an increased risk of product liability. We may be subject to claims against us even if the apparent injury is due to the actions of others. Any litigation that may occur based on physician error in the use of our products and our potential inability to properly train physicians to use our CorPath System may lead to inadequate demand for our products and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success is dependent upon expanding our technology platform for use in other segments. Our potential inability to expand our technology platform beyond PCI and PVI to other segments may adversely affect our ability to increase our revenues.\nCurrently, our only users are interventional physicians in PCI and PVI procedures. We are dependent on our ability to expand our technology platform and sell our products to other vascular markets in the future, including neurointerventional and other more complex cardiac interventions, and achieve the advances required for tele-stenting and remote procedures. The techniques used in these procedures are similar to those used by not only our current user base of interventionalists, but also to those used by other specialists who are generally trained in interventional techniques. Our revenue growth will depend on our ability to obtain approval to sell our CorPath System into these other markets and to sell our products to their physicians and their affiliated hospitals. Convincing physicians to dedicate the time and energy necessary for adequate training in the use of our CorPath System is challenging, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in these efforts. In addition, we do not have significant experience in selling our products to other specialists. They may require, among other things, additional clinical evidence supporting patient and physician benefits, training in a manner to which we are not accustomed or other resources that we do not readily have available or are not cost effective for us to provide. Furthermore, our ability to expand our technology platform for use in other segments of the vascular intervention market beyond PCI, including neurointerventional and other more complex cardiac interventions may be limited by our ability to develop the necessary technology as well as obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for the use on humans and marketing of our products in the United States and in other countries. If we are unable to expand into other markets, growth of our sales will be limited and our revenue will be adversely impacted.\nDecreasing cath lab patient volume and CorPath Cassette utilization could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur current target market consists of cath lab rooms and interventional suites performing percutaneous coronary and vascular procedures. The U.S. cath lab patient volume has decreased over the past several years, leading to increased competition for patients. If the U.S. cath lab patient volume continues to decrease, it may become more difficult for us to grow revenue and increase market share and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, revenue from the sale of our consumable cassettes to cath labs which already have a CorPath System installed is dependent on how often the systems are utilized. We sell CorPath Cassettes and accessories to end users and distributors on an as-needed basis. The revenue from the sale of these products is generally recorded when the items are shipped. If the utilization rate in cath labs decreases, our revenues, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely impacted.\nOur marketing strategy is dependent on collaboration with physician \u201ckey opinion leaders.\u201d\nOur research and development efforts and our marketing strategy depend heavily on obtaining support, physician training assistance and collaboration from highly-regarded physicians at leading commercial and research hospitals, in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to gain and/or maintain such support, training services and collaboration, or if the reputation or standing of these physicians is impaired or otherwise adversely affected, our ability to market our products and, as a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow, could be materially and adversely affected.\nRevenue related to our CorPath Cassettes is derived predominately from customers using our CorPath GRX System. If we do not receive repeat orders of CorPath Cassettes for use with the CorPath GRX System from our customers, our revenue may not grow as expected.\nFor the full year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 96% of our unit volume of revenue generated from the sale of cassettes is from customers using our CorPath GRX System. Cassettes sales for our CorPath 200 first generation platform have declined since the launch of the CorPath GRX System as utilization for CorPath 200 has slowed down significantly and we expect this trend to continue. There are 52 CorPath GRX Systems currently installed at customer sites. The CorPath Cassette is consumed and replaced during each procedure and represents an opportunity for recurring revenue for each procedure. If our customers do not purchase CorPath Cassettes for the CorPath GRX System in the future, our revenue would be adversely impacted.\nOur products face the risk of technological obsolescence, which, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological change. There can be no assurance that third parties will not succeed in developing or marketing technologies and products that are more effective than ours or that would render our technology and products obsolete or noncompetitive. Additionally, new, less invasive surgical procedures and medications could be developed that replace or reduce the importance of current procedures that use or could use our products.\nThe iterative regulatory approvals we have been granted to date for our products demonstrate how rapidly the technology is evolving. In October 2015, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for our robotic-assisted CorPath System to be used during percutaneous coronary interventions performed via radial access, and in March 2016, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for our robotic-assisted CorPath System for use in peripheral vascular interventions. In October 2016, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the CorPath GRX, the second generation of our CorPath System and in February 2018, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for CorPath GRX to be used during peripheral vascular interventions. In March 2018, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the first automated robotic movement designed for the CorPath GRX platform.\nOur success will depend in part upon our ability to respond quickly to medical and technological changes through the development of new products. Product development involves a high degree of risk, and we cannot assure you that our new product development efforts will result in any commercially successful products.\nWe may experience long and variable capital sales cycles and/or seasonality in our business, which may cause fluctuations in our financial results.\nOur CorPath System may have a lengthy sales and purchase order cycle because it is a major capital item and such a purchase generally requires the approval of senior management of hospitals, their parent organizations, purchasing groups, and/or government bodies, as applicable. In addition, hospitals may delay or accelerate system purchases in conjunction with timing of their capital budget timelines. As a result, it is difficult for us to predict the length of capital sales cycles and, therefore, the exact timing of capital sales. We believe that our sales may tend to be heaviest during the third month of each fiscal quarter, and lighter in the third and first fiscal quarters and heavier in the fourth fiscal quarter. Timing of procedures and changes in the procedure market could directly affect the timing of the purchase of our products by hospitals.\nThe above factors may contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results and it is possible that in some future quarters our operating results will fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If that happens, the market price of our stock would likely decrease. These fluctuations, among other factors, also mean that you will not be able to rely upon our operating results in any particular period as an indication of future performance. In addition, the introduction of new products could adversely impact our sales cycle as customers take additional time to assess the benefits and costs of such products.\nIf defects are discovered in our products, we may incur additional unforeseen costs, hospitals may not purchase our products and our reputation may suffer.\nOur products incorporate mechanical parts, electrical components, optical components and computer software, any of which can contain errors or failures, especially when first introduced. In addition, new products or enhancements may contain undetected errors or performance problems that, despite testing, are discovered only after commercial shipment. Because our products are designed to be used to perform complex medical procedures, we expect that our customers will have an increased sensitivity to such defects. We cannot provide any assurances that our products will not experience component aging, errors or performance problems in the future. If we experience flaws or performance problems, any of the following could occur:\n\u25cf\ndelays in product shipments;\n\u25cf\nloss of revenue;\n\u25cf\ndelay in market acceptance;\n\u25cf\ndiversion of our resources;\n\u25cf\ndamage to our reputation;\n\u25cf\nproduct recalls;\n\u25cf\nregulatory actions;\n\u25cf\nincreased service or warranty costs; or\n\u25cf\nproduct liability claims.\nWe may be subject to product recalls that could negatively affect our business.\nWe may be subject to product recalls, withdrawals or seizures if any of our products are believed to cause injury or are subject to serious malfunctions or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations in the manufacture, labeling, promotion, sale or distribution of our products. A recall, withdrawal or seizure of any of our products could materially and adversely affect consumer confidence in our brand and lead to decreased demand for our products. In addition, a recall, withdrawal or seizure of our products would require significant management attention, would likely result in substantial and unexpected expenditures and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business may be affected by unfavorable publicity or lack of consumer acceptance.\nWe are highly dependent upon consumer acceptance of the safety, efficacy and quality of our products. Consumer acceptance of a product can be significantly influenced by scientific research or findings, national media attention and other publicity about product use. A product may be received favorably resulting in high sales associated with that product that may not be sustainable as consumer preferences change. Future scientific research or publicity could be unfavorable to our industry or to any of our products and may not be consistent with earlier favorable research or publicity. A future research report or publicity that is perceived by our consumers as less than favorable or that may question earlier favorable research or publicity could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue. Adverse publicity in the form of published scientific research, statements by regulatory authorities or otherwise, whether or not accurate, that associates the use of our product with adverse effects, or that questions the benefits of our product or a similar product, or that claims that our products are ineffective or unsafe, could reduce market acceptance of our products and could result in decreased product demand and could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. There has been an increased focus on medical device safety over the past year from both the general population and regulatory agencies, including the FDA\u2019s launch of a Medical Device Safety Action Plan in 2018, all of which could materially affect consumer acceptance of technological advances in medical devices generally or in the robotics space in particular.\nWe could be subject to significant, uninsured liabilities.\nIn the future, we may not continue to maintain certain existing insurance coverage or adequate levels of coverage. Premiums for many types of insurance have increased significantly in recent years, and depending on market conditions and our circumstances, in the future, certain types of insurance such as directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance or products liability insurance may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe may encounter manufacturing problems or delays that could result in lost revenue.\nManufacturing our products is a complex process. We may encounter difficulties in scaling up or maintaining production of our products, including:\n\u25cf\nproblems involving production yields;\n\u25cf\nquality control and assurance;\n\u25cf\ncomponent supply shortages;\n\u25cf\nimport or export restrictions on components, materials or technology;\n\u25cf\nshortages of qualified personnel; and\n\u25cf\ncompliance with state and federal regulations.\nIf demand for our products exceeds our manufacturing capacity, we could develop a substantial backlog of customer orders. If we are unable to maintain larger-scale manufacturing capabilities, our ability to generate revenues will be limited and our reputation in the marketplace could be damaged.\nWe depend on limited or single source suppliers and vendors for components and services used in the manufacture of our products, and the partial or complete loss of these suppliers or vendors could cause customer supply or production delays and a substantial loss of revenues.\nWe depend on limited or single source suppliers for certain key components and limited vendors for certain services used to manufacture our products, making us susceptible to quality issues, shortages and price changes. Any of these limited or single source suppliers or vendors could stop producing or supplying our components or stop performing services used to manufacture our products, cease operations or be acquired by, or enter into exclusive arrangements with, one or more potential competitors. As a result, these suppliers and vendors could stop providing components or services to us at commercially reasonable prices, or at all. Because there are a limited number of suppliers and vendors that manufacture the components and provide the services used to manufacture our products, it may be difficult to quickly identify alternate suppliers or vendors or to qualify alternative components or services on commercially reasonable terms, and our ability to satisfy customer demand may be adversely affected, which could result a substantial loss of revenue.\nDisruption of critical information systems or material breaches in the security of our systems could harm our business, customer relations and financial condition.\nInformation technology helps us operate efficiently, interface with customers, maintain financial accuracy and efficiency, comply with data security laws and accurately produce our financial statements. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could violate the law, be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, reputational harm or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through security breach. If our data management systems do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies or human error, our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired, perhaps materially. As the use of digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks and attempts to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and networks, have increased in frequency and sophistication. Despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems are vulnerable to damage from such cyberattacks, including computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Any such impairment could materially and adversely affect our business, including financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the timeliness with which we report our internal and external operating results.\nOur business requires us to use and store personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) of our customers, employees and business partners. This may include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers and payment account information. We require user names and passwords in order to access our information technology systems. We also use encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data. These security measures may be compromised as a result of third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management or other irregularity, and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to our data or accounts. Third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing user names, passwords or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology systems.\nAny such disruption or security breach, as well as any action by us or our employees, contractors or consultants that might be inconsistent with the rapidly evolving data privacy and security laws and regulations applicable within the United States and elsewhere where we conduct business, could result in enforcement actions by the states, the United States Federal government or foreign governments, liability or sanctions under data privacy laws that protect personally identifiable information, regulatory penalties, other legal proceedings, such as but not limited to private litigation, class action law suits, fines and penalties, the incurrence of significant remediation costs, disruptions to our development programs, business operations and collaborations, diversion of management efforts and damage to our reputation, which could harm our business and operations. Because of the rapidly evolving nature of technology and the increasing sophistication of cybersecurity threats, our measures to prevent, respond to and minimize such risks may be unsuccessful.\nWe devote significant resources to network security, data encryption and other security measures to protect our systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security. We may experience a breach of our systems and may be unable to protect sensitive data. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in preventing cyber-attacks or successfully mitigating their effects. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in unexpected interruptions, delays, cessation of service and may harm our business operations. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects our systems or results in the unauthorized release of PII, our reputation and brand could be materially damaged and use of our products and services could decrease. As we grow our business outside of the U.S., we will be subject to additional, complex data security obligations. Compliance with these obligations may be costly and failure to comply may materially harm our business.\nWe may be subject to, or may in the future become subject to, U.S. federal and state, and foreign laws and regulations imposing obligations on how we collect, use, disclose, store and process personal information. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could result in liability or reputational harm and could harm our business.\nThe privacy and security of personally identifiable information stored, maintained, received or transmitted, including electronically, is subject to significant regulation in the United States and abroad. The United States has a \u201csectoral\u201d approach to privacy and data security law, which means that different sectors of the economy have different legal and regulatory requirements for the protection of specific types of data. In the health care industry, for example, there are laws at the federal and state level that overlap and impose differing and sometimes conflicting requirements for the protection of health information. The applicability of these laws can be complex but we must identify and comply with all applicable laws in all of the jurisdictions in which we do business. While we strive to comply with all applicable privacy and security laws and regulations, legal standards for privacy continue to evolve and any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could lead to civil and/or criminal enforcement, civil litigation including class action lawsuits and significant reputational harm and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted a comprehensive general data privacy regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) in 2016 to replace the current European Union Data Protection Directive and related country-specific legislation. The GDPR took effect in May 2018 and governs the collection and use of personal data in the European Union. The GDPR, which is wide-ranging in scope, imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the European Union to the United States. Many important GDPR provisions are vaguely drafted and guidance is lacking, making compliance a complex and resource-intensive effort. GDPR enhances the enforcement authority of data protection authorities and imposes large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to \u20ac20.0 million or 4.0% of the annual global revenues of the infringer, whichever is greater. In addition, data protection authorities of the different European Union member states may interpret the GDPR differently, and guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data in the European Union.\nIn the United States, California recently adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, which will come into effect beginning in January 2020. The CCPA has been characterized as the first \u201cGDPR-like\u201d privacy statute to be enacted in the United States because it mirrors a number of the key provisions of the EU GDPR. The CCPA establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches.\nWe also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to protect such data, could result in enforcement action against us, including fines and public censure, claims for damages by affected individuals and damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill, any of which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to manage growth effectively could prevent us from achieving our goals.\nOur growth strategy may impose a significant burden on our administrative and operational resources. Our ability to effectively manage growth depends on our ability to substantially expand the capabilities of our administrative and operational resources and to attract, train, manage and retain qualified management and other personnel. Our failure to successfully manage growth could result in our sales not increasing commensurately with capital investments. Our inability to successfully manage growth could materially adversely affect our business.\nAny failure to adequately expand our direct sales force will impede our growth. If we are unable to attract, hire and retain qualified sales and management personnel, the commercial opportunity for our products may be diminished.\nWe expect to be substantially dependent on a direct sales force to attract new business and to manage customer relationships. We plan to expand our direct sales force and believe that there is significant competition for qualified, productive direct sales personnel with advanced sales skills and technical knowledge of our industry. Our ability to achieve significant growth in revenue in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient direct sales personnel. Recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as expected and we may be unable to hire sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business. If we are unable to hire and develop sufficient numbers of productive sales personnel, our business prospects could suffer.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our sales force consisted of 16 and 9 Regional Sales Managers and Clinicals, respectively. We may not be able to attract, hire, train and retain qualified sales and sales management personnel. If we are not successful in our efforts to maintain and grow a qualified sales force, our ability to independently market and promote our products may be impaired. Even if we are able to effectively maintain a qualified sales force, our sales force may not be successful in commercializing our products.\nTo successfully market and sell our CorPath System internationally, we must address many issues with which we have little or no experience.\nTo date, we have marketed our CorPath System both domestically in the United States and internationally. Over the long term, we intend to grow our business internationally, and to do so we will need to continue to attract distributors and expand our sales operations to effectively sell our CorPath System internationally. Distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market and sell our CorPath System in accordance with our expectations. If future distributors do not perform adequately, or we are unable to locate distributors for particular geographic areas, we may not realize expected long-term international revenue growth. International sales are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf\ndifferent regulatory pathways to get to market and different marketing requirements upon commercialization;\n\u25cf\nvarying coverage and reimbursement processes and procedures;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u25cf\nexport restrictions, trade regulations and foreign tax laws;\n\u25cf\nfluctuating foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf\nforeign certification and regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\ncomplex data privacy and security regulations;\n\u25cf\nlengthy payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u25cf\ncustoms clearance and shipping delays;\n\u25cf\nlegal and regulatory requirements related to anti-bribery laws in foreign jurisdictions, as well as in relation to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA);\n\u25cf\npolitical and economic instability; and\n\u25cf\npreference for locally produced products.\nIf one or more of these risks is realized, it could require us to dedicate significant resources to remedy the situation, our plan to expand internationally may fail and our financial performance may suffer as a result.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel, or to retain our executive management team, we may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize our products.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified managerial personnel. We are highly dependent upon our executive management team. The loss of the services of any one or more of the members of our executive management team could delay or prevent the successful completion of some of our development and commercialization objectives.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified sales and marketing personnel is critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain these personnel on acceptable terms. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may also be employed by other companies and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include, but is not limited to, intentional or negligent failures to comply with FDA or U.S. health care laws and regulations or applicable laws, regulations, guidance or codes of conduct set by foreign governmental authorities or self-regulatory industry organizations, provide accurate information to any governmental authorities such as the FDA, comply with manufacturing standards we may establish, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the medical device industry are subject to extensive laws, regulations, guidance and codes of conduct intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws, regulations, guidance or codes of conduct. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines and/or other sanctions.\nOur business entails a significant risk of product liability and our ability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nOur business exposes us to significant product liability risks inherent in the development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical device products, including product liability exposure relating to the testing of our CorPath System in human clinical trials. Because our CorPath System is designed to be used in complex surgical procedures, defects could result in a number of complications, including serious personal injury or death. Claims could be brought against us if use or misuse of our CorPath System causes, or merely appears to have caused, personal injury or death. Product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class. Product liability claims could lead to an inadequate demand for our products and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such claims could result in an investigation by certain regulatory authorities, such as the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, of the safety and effectiveness of our products, our manufacturing processes and potentially a recall of our products or more serious enforcement action, or suspension or withdrawal of marketing clearances or approvals. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may also result in decreased demand for our products, injury to our reputation, costs to defend related litigation, a diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources, substantial monetary awards to clinical trial participants or patients and/or a decline in our stock price. Additionally, we have entered into various agreements where we indemnify third parties for certain claims relating to our products. These indemnification obligations may require us to pay significant sums of money for claims that are covered by these indemnification obligations. We have and intend to maintain product liability insurance that we believe is appropriate for our stage of commercialization. Any insurance we have or may obtain in the future may not provide sufficient coverage against potential liabilities. Furthermore, product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, we may be unable to obtain sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost to protect us against losses caused by product liability claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business. We are not currently subject to any product liability claims; however, future product liability claims against us, regardless of their merit, may result.\nOur current operations are concentrated in one location and any events affecting this location may have material adverse consequences.\nOur current operations are located in our facilities situated in Waltham, Massachusetts. Any unplanned event, such as flood, fire, explosion, earthquake, extreme weather condition, medical epidemics, power shortage, telecommunication failure or other natural or manmade accidents or incidents that prevent us from fully utilizing the facilities, may have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business, particularly on a daily basis, and have significant negative consequences on our financial and operating conditions. Loss of access to these facilities may result in increased costs, delays in the development of our product candidates or interruption of our business operations. As part of our risk management policy, we maintain insurance coverage at levels that we believe are appropriate for our business. However, in the event of an accident or incident at these facilities, we cannot assure you that the amounts of insurance will be sufficient to satisfy any damages and losses. If our facilities are unable to operate because of an accident or incident or for any other reason, even for a short period of time, any or all of our research and development programs may be harmed. Any business interruption may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.\nChanges in accounting rules and regulations, or interpretations thereof, could result in unfavorable accounting charges or require us to change our compensation policies.\nAccounting methods and policies for medical device companies, including policies governing revenue recognition, research and development and related expenses and accounting for stock-based compensation, are subject to review, interpretation and guidance from our independent registered accounting firm and relevant accounting authorities, including the SEC. Changes to accounting methods or policies, or interpretations thereof, may require us to reclassify, restate or otherwise change or revise our consolidated financial statements, including those contained in our Annual Reports on Form 10-K.\nSoftware errors or other defects may be discovered in our products.\nOur products incorporate many components, including sophisticated computer software. Complex software frequently contains errors, especially when first introduced. Because our products are designed to be used to perform complex procedures, we expect that physicians and hospitals will have an increased sensitivity to the potential for software defects. We cannot assure you that our software or other components will not experience errors or performance problems in the future. If we experience software errors or performance problems, we would likely also experience:\n\u25cf\nloss of revenue;\n\u25cf\ndelay in market acceptance of our products;\n\u25cf\ndamage to our reputation;\n\u25cf\nadditional regulatory filings;\n\u25cf\nproduct recalls;\n\u25cf\ndata breaches;\n\u25cf\nincreased service or warranty costs; and/or\n\u25cf\nproduct liability claims relating to the software defects.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain protection for intellectual property relating to our technology and products, the value of our technology and products will be adversely affected.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection for the intellectual property covering or incorporated into our technology and products. The patent situation in the field of medical devices involves complex legal and scientific questions. We rely upon patents, trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements to protect our technology and products. We may not be able to obtain patent rights relating to our technology or products and pending patent applications to which we have rights may not issue as patents or if issued, may not issue in a form that will be advantageous to us. Even if issued, any patents issued to us may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated, held to be unenforceable or circumvented. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nTrademarks and trademark protection of our products may not provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage.\nWe use trademarks on our products and believe that having distinctive marks is an important factor in marketing them. Distinctive marks may also be important for any additional products that we successfully develop and commercially market. If we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected. Our trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. Any trademark litigation, including legal proceedings to seek to protect our trademarks, could be expensive, and it is possible that our efforts could be unsuccessful. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names or may be forced to stop using these names.\nWe may in the future be a party to patent litigation and administrative proceedings that could be costly and could interfere with our ability to sell our CorPath System.\nLitigation related to infringement and other intellectual property claims, with or without merit, is unpredictable, can be expensive and time consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from our core business. If we lose this kind of litigation, a court could require us to pay substantial damages, and prohibit us from using technologies essential to our CorPath System, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If relevant patents are upheld as valid and enforceable and we are found to infringe, we could be prevented from selling our CorPath System unless we can obtain a license to use technology or ideas covered by such patents or are able to redesign our CorPath System to avoid infringement. We do not know whether any necessary licenses would be available to us on satisfactory terms, if at all, or whether we could redesign our CorPath System or processes to avoid infringement.\nCompeting products may also appear in other countries in which our patent coverage might not exist or be as strong. If we lose a foreign patent lawsuit, we could be prevented from marketing our CorPath System in one or more foreign countries.\nRisks Related to Government Regulations\nHealthcare legislative reform measures may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the \u201cPPACA\u201d), was signed into law which makes changes that significantly impact healthcare providers, insurers, pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers.\nThe PPACA contains a number of provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions, among other things. This includes new fees or taxes on certain health-related industries, including medical device manufacturers, regardless of whether the companies are profitable. Beginning in 2013, medical device manufacturers were required to pay an excise tax (or sales tax) of 2.3% of certain United States medical device revenues. Under this provision, we have paid an excise tax of approximately $0.1 million through December 31, 2015, which tax is reflected in our operating expenses. Though there are some exceptions to the excise tax, this excise tax applies to all or most of our products sold within the United States. The excise tax was suspended due to the operation of a provision in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016, signed into law on December 18, 2015 but that two-year suspension period ended on December 31, 2017. In mid-January 2018, with the signing of P.L. 115-120, suspension of the medical device excise tax was extended for an additional two years ending on December 31, 2019 and made retroactive to January 1, 2018. At the present time, there is no guarantee that the excise tax will continue to be suspended by congressional action after this two-year moratorium ends, or that any provisions of the PPACA will continue to exist in their current form. The PPACA also establishes a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical effectiveness research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research; implements payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians, and other providers to improve the coordination, quality, and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models; and creates an independent payment advisory board that will submit recommendations to reduce Medicare spending if projected Medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate.\nThe PPACA provisions on comparative clinical effectiveness research also extend the initiatives of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, known as the stimulus package, which included $1.1 billion in funding to study the comparative effectiveness of health care treatments and strategies. This stimulus funding was designated for, among other things, conducting, supporting or reviewing research that compares and evaluates the risks and benefits, clinical outcomes, effectiveness and appropriateness of products. The PPACA appropriates additional funding to comparative clinical effectiveness research. Although Congress has indicated that this funding is intended to improve the quality of health care, it remains unclear how the research will impact current Medicare coverage and reimbursement or how new information will influence other third-party payor policies. The taxes imposed by the PPACA and the expansion in the government\u2019s role in the United States. healthcare industry may result in decreased profits to us, lower reimbursement by payors using our products, and/or reduced medical procedure volumes, all of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, creates the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2.0% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Strong, partisan disagreement in Congress has prevented implementation of various PPACA provisions, and the Trump administration has made repeal of the PPACA a priority. One of the first executive orders of the Trump administration granted federal agencies broad powers to unwind regulations under the PPACA. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. The uncertainty around the future of the PPACA, and in particular the impact on reimbursement levels and the number of insured individuals, may lead to uncertainty or delay in the purchasing decisions of our customers, which may in turn negatively impact our product sales. If there are not adequate reimbursement levels, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. For the immediate future, there is significant uncertainty regarding the health care, health care coverage and health care insurance market.\nWe expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and our ability to successfully commercialize our products or could limit or eliminate our spending on certain development projects.\nThe United States government has in the past considered, is currently considering and may in the future consider healthcare policies and proposals intended to curb rising healthcare costs, including those that could significantly affect both private and public reimbursement for healthcare services. State and local governments, as well as a number of foreign governments, are also considering or have adopted similar types of policies. Future significant changes in the healthcare systems in the United States or elsewhere, and current uncertainty about whether and how changes may be implemented, could have a negative impact on the demand for our products. We are unable to predict whether other healthcare policies, including policies stemming from legislation or regulations affecting our business, may be proposed or enacted in the future; what effect such policies would have on our business; or the effect ongoing uncertainty about these matters will have on the purchasing decisions of our customers.\nWe are subject to federal and state laws governing our business practices which, if violated, could result in substantial civil and criminal penalties. Additionally, challenges to or investigations of our practices could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to and could otherwise harm our business.\nThe Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback laws, and similar state laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, prohibit payments or other remuneration that could be considered to induce hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers of our products either to refer patients or to purchase, lease or order, or arrange for or recommend the purchase, lease or order of healthcare products or services for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Further, the recently enacted PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal health care fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government or a whistleblower may assert that a claim (including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute) constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims act. These laws may affect our sales, marketing and other contractual and promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers of our products. They particularly impact how we structure our sales offerings, including discount practices, customer support, education and training programs, physician consulting and other service arrangements. These laws are broadly written, and it is often difficult to determine precisely how these laws will be applied to specific circumstances. Violating anti-kickback laws can result in civil and criminal penalties, which can be substantial and include exclusion from government healthcare programs for noncompliance. Even an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity, and be costly to defend, and thus could materially harm our business and results of operations.\nThe PPACA also imposes new reporting and disclosure requirements on device manufacturers for any \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to physicians, teaching hospitals and other healthcare providers. Such information must be made publicly available in a searchable format. In addition, device manufacturers will also be required to report and disclose any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of approximately $0.2 million per year (and up to an aggregate of $1.0 million per year for \u201cknowing failures\u201d), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission. Device manufacturers were required to begin collecting data on August 1, 2013 and were required to submit reports to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) by March 31, 2014 and the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. We submitted our report due March 31, 2014 in a timely manner and continue to be in compliance with this reporting requirement.\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians, including the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. Certain states mandate implementation of corporate compliance programs to ensure compliance with these laws, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. The shifting corporate compliance environment, and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and/or reporting requirements, increases the possibility that we may be found out of compliance of one or more of the requirements, subjecting us to significant civil monetary penalties.\nCompliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our potential international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and could expose us or our employees to fines and penalties in the United States and/or abroad. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar laws in foreign countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation. There can be no assurance that our policies and procedures are sufficient to ensure compliance with these laws or that our employees, contractors or agents will not violate our policies and procedures.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires us to track and disclose the source of certain metals used in manufacturing which may stem from minerals (so-called \u201cconflict minerals\u201d) which originate in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining regions. These metals include tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten. In most cases no acceptable alternative material exists which has the necessary properties. It is not possible to determine the source of the metals by analysis but instead a good faith description of the source of the intermediate components and raw materials must be obtained. The components which incorporate those metals may originate from many sources and we may purchase fabricated products from manufacturers who may have a long and difficult-to-trace supply chain. As the spot price of these materials varies, producers of the metal intermediates can be expected to change the mix of sources used, and components and assemblies which we buy may have a mix of sources as their origin. We do not believe these materials are present in the component parts that we use in our CorPath System, but there can be no assurance that these metals will not be included in our components and assemblies from time to time.\nOur products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain domestic regulatory review process. If we do not obtain and maintain the necessary domestic regulatory authorizations, we will not be able to provide our products in the United States. Recent initiatives by the FDA to enhance and modernize various regulatory pathways for device products and its overall approach to safety and innovation in the medical technology industry creates additional uncertainty and the possibility of changing product development costs, requirements, and other factors.\nOur products and operations are subject to extensive regulation in the United States by the FDA. The FDA regulates the development, bench and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, promotion, marketing, sales, distribution and post-market support and reporting of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In order for us to market our Class II products for use in the United States, we must first obtain clearance from the FDA pursuant to Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFFDCA\u201d). In October 2015, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for our robotic-assisted CorPath System to be used during PCI procedures performed via radial access, and on March 29, 2016, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for our robotic-assisted CorPath System for use in peripheral vascular interventions. In October 2016, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for the CorPath GRX, the second generation of the CorPath System and in February 2018, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for CorPath GRX to be used during peripheral vascular interventions. In March 2018, we received 510k) clearance from the FDA for the first automated robotic movement designed for the CorPath GRX platform.\nClearance under Section 510(k) requires demonstration that a new device is substantially equivalent to another device with 510(k) clearance or grandfathered (\u201cpre-amendment\u201d) status or to a device that was reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I (those are referred to as predicate devices). If we significantly modify our products after they receive FDA clearance, or seek to market them for additional indications for use, the FDA may require us to submit a separate 510(k) or premarket approval application (\u201cPMA\u201d), or potentially a De Novo request, for the modified product before we are permitted to market the products in the U.S. In addition, if we develop products in the future that are not considered to be substantially equivalent to a predicate device, we will be required to obtain FDA approval by submitting a PMA. The FDA may not act favorably or quickly in its review of our 510(k) or PMA submissions or we may encounter significant difficulties and costs in our efforts to obtain FDA clearance or approval, any of which could delay or preclude our sale of new products in the United States. Furthermore, the FDA may request additional data or require us to conduct further testing, or compile more data, including clinical data and clinical studies, in support of a 510(k) submission.\nRegulatory policy affecting our products can change at any time. The changes and their impact on our business cannot be accurately predicted. For example FDA and other government agencies, have been focusing on the cybersecurity risks associated with certain medical devices and encouraging device manufacturers to take a more proactive approach to assessing the cybersecurity risks of their devices both during development and on a periodic basis after the devices are in commercial distribution. These regulatory efforts could lead to new FDA requirements in the future or additional product liability or other litigation risks if one of our products is considered to be susceptible to third-party tampering. In August 2016, the FDA released its proposals for reforming long-standing procedures and requirements related to modifications to medical devices already on the market, and those proposals were finalized in October 2017. In December 2016, Congress passed the 21st Century Cures Act, which makes multiple changes to the FDA\u2019s rules for medical devices as well as for clinical trials, and Congress passed another large piece of legislation related to medical devices in August 2017, the Medical Device User Fee reauthorization package, that could have certain impacts on our business. In recent months beginning in early 2018, FDA has also announced a series of efforts to modernize and streamline the 510(k) notification and regulatory review process and monitoring of post-market safety, as well as issued a Proposed Rule to formalize the De Novo classification process to provide clarity to innovative device developers. Changes in the FDA 510(k) process could make clearance more difficult to obtain, increase delay, add uncertainty and have other significant adverse effects on our ability to obtain and maintain clearance for our products.\nIt is unclear at this time whether and how various activities recently initiated or announced by the FDA to modernize the United States medical device regulatory system could affect our business, given the timing and the undeveloped nature of some of the FDA\u2019s new medical device safety and innovation initiatives. One of the recent initiatives was announced in April 2018, when the FDA Commissioner issued a statement with the release of a Medical Device Safety Action Plan. Among other key areas of the Medical Device Safety Action Plan, the Commissioner stated that the FDA is \u201c exploring what further actions we can take to spur innovation towards technologies that can make devices and their use safer.\u201d An update to the Safety Action Plan was communicated by FDA leadership in November 2018 with a particular focus on post-market surveillance and how to respond when new safety concerns emerge once a product in on the market. Similarly, the FDA Commissioner announced various agency goals under a Medical Innovation Access Plan in 2017. These initiatives create the possibility of unanticipated regulatory and other potential changes to our products and our overall business that could adversely affect our business and results of operations\nThe FDA may also, instead of accepting a 510(k) submission, require us to submit a PMA, which is typically a much more complex, lengthy and burdensome application than a 510(k) submission. To support a PMA, the FDA would likely require that we conduct one or more clinical studies to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective. In some cases such studies may be requested for a 510(k) as well. We may not be able to meet the requirements to obtain 510(k) clearance or PMA approval (or a De Novo classification request), in which case the FDA may not grant any necessary clearances or approvals. In addition, the FDA may place significant limitations upon the intended uses of our products as a condition to a 510(k) clearance or PMA approval. Product applications can also be denied or withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following clearance or approval. Any delays or failure to obtain FDA clearance or approval of new products we develop, any limitations imposed by the FDA on new product use or the costs of obtaining FDA clearance or approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn order to conduct a clinical investigation involving human subjects for the purpose of demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a medical device, a company must, among other things, apply for and obtain Institutional Review Board (\u2018IRB\u201d) approval of the proposed investigation. In addition, if the clinical study involves a \u201csignificant risk\u201d (as defined by the FDA) to human health, the sponsor of the investigation must also submit and obtain FDA approval of an Investigational Device Exemption (\u201cIDE\u201d) application. Our system product is considered a significant risk device requiring IDE approval prior to investigational use. We may not be able to obtain FDA and/or IRB approval to undertake clinical trials in the United States for any new devices we intend to market in the United States in the future. If we do obtain such approvals, we may not be able to conduct studies which comply with the IDE and other regulations governing clinical investigations or the data from any such trials may not support clearance or approval of the investigational device. Failure to obtain such approvals or to comply with such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Certainty that clinical trials will meet desired endpoints, produce meaningful or useful data and be free of unexpected adverse effects, or that the FDA will accept the validity of foreign clinical study data cannot be assured, and such uncertainty could preclude or delay market clearance or authorizations resulting in significant financial costs and reduced revenue.\nIf we fail to obtain regulatory clearances in other countries for existing products or products under development, we will not be able to commercialize these products in those countries.\nIn order for us to market our products in other countries, we must comply with extensive safety and quality regulations in other countries regarding the quality, safety and efficacy of our products. These regulations, including the requirements for approvals, clearance or grant of Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne (\u201cCE\u201d) Certificates of Conformity, PMDA approval in Japan, and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Failure to obtain regulatory approval, clearance or CE Certificates of Conformity (or equivalent) in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products may harm our ability to generate revenue and harm our business. Approval and CE marking procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval or CE Certificate of Conformity in other countries might differ from that required to obtain FDA clearance. The regulatory approval or CE marking process in other countries may include all of the risks detailed above regarding FDA clearance in the United States. Regulatory approval or the CE marking of a product in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval or a CE Certificate of Conformity in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. Failure to obtain regulatory approval or a CE Certificate of Conformity in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval could have the same adverse effects described above regarding FDA clearance in the United States.\nThe primary regulatory environment in Europe is that of the European Economic Area (the \u201cEEA\u201d), which is comprised of the 28 Member States of the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Although we received a CE Certificate of Conformity for our CorPath GRX System in 2016, we cannot be certain that we will be successful in meeting and continuing to meet the requirements to market a medical device in the EEA in light of the current transition period between the prior system called the Medical Device Directive, to the current system called the Medical Device Regulation (\u201cMDR\u201d). The MDR went into force in May 2017 and allows a three-year transition period until 2020 for Member States, regulatory authorities, and medical device stakeholders to come into compliance with the new requirements. The new rules and procedures that have been created under the overhauled European regulations will likely result in increased regulatory oversight of all medical devices marketed in the E.U., and this may, in turn, increase the costs, time and requirements that need to be met in order to place an innovative or high-risk medical device on the EEA market.\nWe may incur liability related to the off-label marketing or misleading advertising of our products.\nThe FDA regulates the promotional labeling for and the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) regulates the advertising of our products to ensure that the claims we make are consistent with our regulatory clearances, that there is scientific data to substantiate the claims and that our promotion and advertising is neither false nor misleading. The off-label marketing or false advertising of our products may harm our image in the marketplace, result in injuries that lead to product liability suits, which could be costly to our business, or result in costly investigations and sanctions from the FDA and other regulatory bodies if we are deemed to have engaged in off-label promotion or false advertising.\nIf we are found to have violated laws protecting the confidentiality of patient health information, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities and harm our reputation or our business.\nThere are a number of federal and state laws in the United States protecting the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restricting the use and disclosure of that information. In particular, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services promulgated patient privacy rules and security standards under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the HITECH Act of 2009 (collectively, \u201cHIPAA\u201d), which expanded the application of those rules and added breach notification requirements. These privacy rules protect medical records and other patient health information by limiting their use and disclosure. HIPAA also gives individuals the right to access, amend and seek accounting of their own health information and limits most use and disclosures of health information to the minimum amount reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose of the use or disclosure. HIPAA does not apply to us, but it imposes significant restrictions on our customers and their ability to share patient information with us. Our failure to structure interactions with our physician customers in a HIPAA compliant manner may result in significant penalties to our customers and harm to our business.\nComplying with FDA regulations is a complex process, and our failure to comply fully could subject us to significant enforcement actions.\nBecause our products are commercially distributed in the U.S., numerous quality and post-market regulatory requirements apply, including the following:\n\u25cf\ncontinued compliance with the FDA CGMPs/Quality System Regulations (\u201cQSR\u201d), which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the development and manufacturing process, as well as to take into account newly emerging risks associated with a medical device such as cybersecurity vulnerabilities;\n\u25cf\nlabeling regulations;\n\u25cf\nthe FDA\u2019s general prohibition against false or misleading statements in the labeling or promotion of products for unapproved uses;\n\u25cf\nstringent complaint reporting and Medical Device Reporting regulations, which requires that manufacturers keep detailed records of investigations or complaints against their devices and to report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur;\n\u25cf\nadequate use of the Corrective and Preventive Actions process to identify and correct or prevent significant systemic failures of products or processes or in trends which suggest same; and\n\u25cf\nthe reporting of Corrections and Removals, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA recalls and field corrective actions taken to reduce a risk to health or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may pose a risk to health.\nWe are subject to inspection and marketing surveillance by the FDA to determine our compliance with these and other regulatory requirements. If the FDA finds that we have failed to comply, it can institute a wide variety of regulatory or enforcement actions, ranging from inspectional observations (Form FDA 483) to a public Warning Letter to more severe civil and criminal sanctions including the seizure of our products and equipment or a ban on the import or export of our products. Our failure to comply with applicable requirements could lead to an enforcement action that may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAny modification or change of medical devices cleared for market requires the manufacturer to make a determination whether the change is significant enough to require new 510(k) clearance. We have created labeling, advertising, and user training for our CorPath System to describe specific procedures that we believe are fully within the scope of our existing 510(k) indications for use as cleared by FDA and stated in our 510(k) clearance letters. We cannot assure you that the FDA would agree that all such specific procedures are within the scope of the existing general clearance or that we have compiled adequate information to support the safety and efficacy of using the CorPath System for all such specific procedures.\nInadequate funding for the FDA, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other government agencies could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory, and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) and other government agencies on which our operations may rely are subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new products to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, including beginning in December 2018, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA and the SEC, have had to furlough critical FDA, SEC and other government employees and stop critical activities. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, future government shutdowns could impact our ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to properly capitalize and continue our operations.\nIf our manufacturing facilities do not continue to meet federal, state or other manufacturing standards, we may be required to temporarily cease all or part of our manufacturing operations, cease distribution of our products and/or recall our products, any of which would result in significant product delivery delays and lost revenue.\nOur manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities and our operations will continue to be regulated and inspected by the FDA and other regulatory agencies for compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices (\u201cCGMP\u201d) requirements including in the QSR and other applicable regulatory requirements. For any CorPath Systems shipped internationally, we are also required to comply with the International Organization for Standardization (\u201cISO\u201d) quality system standards as well as European Directives and norms in order to produce products for sale in the EU. In addition, many countries such as Canada and Japan have very specific additional regulatory requirements for quality assurance and manufacturing. If we fail to continue to comply with CGMP requirements, as well as ISO or other regulatory standards, we may be required to cease all or part of our operations until we comply with these regulations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nIf our stock price declines, our common stock may be subject to delisting from NYSE American.\nOur common stock was approved for listing on NYSE American and commenced trading on May 29, 2015 under the symbol \u201cCVRS.\u201d Our Company\u2019s common stock was previously traded on the OTCQB as provided by OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the symbol \u201cCVRS.\u201d Our common stock is currently trading at a price of less than $2.00 per share. We currently meet the continued listing standards of NYSE American. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to comply with the standards that we are required to meet in order to maintain a listing of our common stock on NYSE American. Our failure to continue to meet these requirements may result in our common stock being delisted from NYSE American. If our common stock is delisted, this would, among other things, substantially impair our ability to raise additional funds and could result in a loss of institutional investor interest and fewer development opportunities for us.\nThe price of our common stock could be highly volatile due to a number of factors, which could lead to losses by investors and costly securities litigation.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our Company will result in an active trading market on NYSE American or any other exchange that we may trade on in the future. The trading price of our common stock on NYSE American has been highly volatile and is likely to continue to be highly volatile in response to a number of factors including, without limitation, the following:\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in price and volume due to investor speculation and other factors that may not be tied to our financial performance;\n\u25cf\nperformance by us in the execution of our business plan;\n\u25cf\nfinancial viability;\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of developments by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nmarket conditions in our industry;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf\nadoption of new accounting standards affecting our industry;\n\u25cf\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf\nintroduction of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nsales of our common stock or other securities in the open market;\n\u25cf\nthe issuance of additional shares of our preferred stock common stock, or the perception that such issuances may occur, including through our \u201cat-the-market\u201d offering program;\n\u25cf\nregulatory developments in both the United States and foreign countries;\n\u25cf\nperformance of products sold and advertised by licensees in the marketplace;\n\u25cf\neconomic and other external factors;\n\u25cf\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in financial results; and\n\u25cf\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations. In the past, and several recent situations, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has been initiated against such company. Litigation initiated against us, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to successfully maintain our internal controls over financial reporting or if material weaknesses are discovered in our internal accounting procedures, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nAny failure to develop or maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting or difficulties encountered in maintaining or improving our internal controls over financial reporting could harm our operating results and prevent us from meeting our reporting obligations. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly. In addition, investors relying upon this misinformation could make an uninformed investment decision, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the Commission or other regulatory authorities or to stockholder class action securities litigation.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our common stockholders might otherwise receive a premium price for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u25cf\nestablish a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time;\n\u25cf\nallow the authorized number of our directors to be changed only by resolution of our board of directors;\n\u25cf\nlimit the manner in which stockholders can remove directors from the board;\n\u25cf\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals that can be acted on at stockholder meetings and for nominations to our board of directors;\n\u25cf\nlimit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf\nprohibit actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u25cf\nrequire that stockholder actions be effected at a duly called stockholders meeting;\n\u25cf\nauthorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u25cf\nrequire the approval of the holders of at least 75% of the votes that all our stockholders would be entitled to cast to amend or repeal certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation or by-laws.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a manner prescribed by the statute.\nIn addition, in the event of a change of control, we would be required to redeem all outstanding shares of our redeemable preferred stock for an aggregate of $26.8 million, at the price of $1.25 per share. Further, our certificate of incorporation permits us to issue additional shares of preferred stock. The terms of our redeemable preferred stock or any new preferred stock we may issue could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control.\nInsiders have substantial control over the outstanding shares of our common stock and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control, including a transaction in which our stockholders could sell or exchange their shares for a premium.\nAs of March 1, 2019, our directors and executive officers beneficially own an aggregate of approximately 35% of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, our directors and executive officers, if acting together, may have the ability to affect the outcome of matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election and removal of directors, and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these persons acting together may have the ability to control our management and business affairs. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may harm the value of our common stock by:\n\u25cf\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change in control;\n\u25cf\nimpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination; or\n\u25cf\ndiscouraging a potential acquirer from making an acquisition proposal or otherwise attempting to obtain control.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock and investors should not buy our common stock expecting to receive dividends.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate that we will declare or pay any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, we are restricted from pay cash dividends on our common stock under our term loan and revolving loan facilities. Consequently, you will only realize an economic gain on your investment in our common stock if the price appreciates. You should not purchase our common stock expecting to receive cash dividends. Since we do not pay dividends on our common stock, and if we are not successful in establishing an orderly trading market for our shares, then you may not have any manner to liquidate or receive any payment on your investment. Therefore our failure to pay dividends on our common stock may cause you to not see any return on your investment even if we are successful in our business operations. In addition, because we do not pay dividends on our common stock, we may have trouble raising additional funds which could affect our ability to expand our business operations.\nWe are likely to raise additional funds, finance acquisitions or develop strategic relationships by issuing capital stock.\nWe have financed our operations, and we expect to continue to finance our operations, make acquisitions and develop strategic relationships by issuing equity or convertible debt securities which could significantly reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. Furthermore, any newly issued securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing common stock. Moreover, any issuances by us of equity securities may be at or below the prevailing market price of our common stock and in any event may have a dilutive impact on your ownership interest, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. We may also raise additional funds through the incurrence of debt, and the holders of any debt we may issue would have rights superior to your rights in the event we are not successful and are forced to seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws.\nWe have issued shares of our preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock and we may from time to time issue additional shares of preferred stock with greater rights than our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue one or more additional series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from our stockholders. In 2018, we issued two series of our preferred stock, Series A preferred stock and Series A-1 preferred stock, with rights greater than our common stock. Holders of our Series A preferred stock are entitled to non-compounding dividends in shares of Series A-1 preferred stock, at the rate of 12% per annum. Our preferred stock also rank senior to the common stock and to any other class of our capital stock existing now or hereafter created that are not specifically designated as ranking senior to the preferred stock. In addition, holders of our preferred stock are entitled to a liquidation preference and certain conversion rights. Holders of our Series A and Series A-1 preferred stock are also entitled to voting rights, which require their consent for certain corporate actions as further described in our certificate of designation.\nSecurities analysts may not cover our common stock and this may have a negative impact on our common stock\u2019s market price.\nThe future trading market for our common stock may depend on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. We may face additional risks since we became a public company through an acquisition which, for accounting purposes, was treated as a reverse merger. There is no guarantee that securities analysts will cover our common stock and there may be little incentive to brokerage firms to recommend the purchase of our common stock. If securities analysts do not cover our common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect our common stock\u2019s market price, if any. If we are covered by securities analysts who downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to publish regular reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur management devotes substantial time to our compliance with regulations and we incur significant costs as a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and NYSE American have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives and we anticipate that such efforts will continue, particularly as we cease to be able to avail ourselves of the reduced disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly.\nIn particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules subsequently implemented by the Commission impose various requirements on public companies with respect to corporate governance practices. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that our management maintain adequate disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and, as applicable, our independent registered public accounting firm, to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting\nWe may become involved in securities class action litigation that could divert management\u2019s attention and harm our business.\nThe stock market, in general, and the market for medical device companies, in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation often is expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially harm our financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 15344, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "CVRS"}
