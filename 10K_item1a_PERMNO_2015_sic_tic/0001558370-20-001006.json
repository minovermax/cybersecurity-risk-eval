{"cik": "1606745", "company": "Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks described below and elsewhere in this annual report are not the only ones that relate to our businesses or our capitalization. The risks described below are considered to be the most material. However, there may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that also could have material adverse effects on our businesses. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any of the events described below were to occur, our businesses, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nFactors Relating to Our Corporate History and Structure\nWe are a holding company, and we could be unable in the future to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service our financial obligations or meet our other commitments.\nOur ability to meet our financial obligations and other contractual commitments, including to make debt service payments under the Margin Loan Agreement (as defined below) and any other credit facilities that we may obtain in the future, depends upon our ability to access cash. We are a holding company, and our sources of cash include our available cash balances, any dividends and interest we may receive from our investments and proceeds from any asset sales we may undertake in the future. We currently have no plans with respect to any asset sales. The ability of Tripadvisor to pay dividends or to make other payments or advances to us depends on its operating results and any statutory, regulatory or contractual restrictions to which it may be or may become subject.\nWe do not have access to the cash that Tripadvisor generates from its operating activities.\nTripadvisor generated $424 million, $405 million and $238 million of cash from its operations during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Tripadvisor uses the cash it generates from its operations to fund its investing activities and to service its debt and other financing obligations. We do not have access to the cash that Tripadvisor generates unless Tripadvisor declares a dividend on its capital stock payable in cash, repurchases any or all of its outstanding shares of capital stock for cash or otherwise distributes or makes payments to its stockholders, including us. Other than the special dividend paid in December 2019, Tripadvisor has not historically paid any dividends on its capital stock or, with limited exceptions, otherwise distributed cash to its stockholders and instead has used all of its available cash in the expansion of its business and to service its debt obligations. Covenants in Tripadvisor\u2019s existing debt instruments also restrict the payment of dividends and cash distributions to stockholders. We expect that Tripadvisor will continue to apply its available cash to the expansion of its business.\nOur company may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing, or refinance our existing indebtedness, on acceptable terms.\nWe had outstanding borrowings of $355 million (the \u201cMargin Loan\u201d) at December 31, 2019, including paid in kind interest, under a margin loan agreement (the \u201cMargin Loan Agreement\u201d) entered into by our bankruptcy remote wholly-owned subsidiary (\u201cTripSPV\u201d). Borrowings under the Margin Loan Agreement are guaranteed solely by our company and secured by our ownership interest in Tripadvisor. The Margin Loan matures in November 2022, and if we decide to refinance the Margin Loan, we may not be able to do so on acceptable terms. All of our equity interests in Tripadvisor are and will be held through TripSPV. Because our primary asset consists of our equity interests in Tripadvisor and the Margin Loan Agreement prohibits, with limited exceptions, the incurrence of additional indebtedness by TripSPV, our company is very limited in its ability to incur additional financing and our cash reserves may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations. In addition, the Margin Loan Agreement provides that, among other triggering events, if at any time the closing price per share of Tripadvisor common stock falls below certain minimum values, a partial repayment of the Margin Loan to a certain specified amount will be due and payable with respect to each such circumstance, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If the company or TripSPV is unable to pay such amounts, the lenders may foreclose on the pledged stock of Tripadvisor that TripSPV holds and any other collateral that then secures TripSPV\u2019s obligations under the Margin Loan Agreement, which would materially adversely affect our asset composition and financial condition as well as our access to capital on a going forward basis.\nI-10\nIn addition, the availability of capital for our company will be subject to prevailing general economic and credit market conditions, including interest rate levels and the availability of credit generally, and financial, business and other factors, all of which are beyond the control of our company. In light of periodic uncertainty in the capital and credit markets, there can be no assurance that sufficient financing will be available on desirable terms, if at all, to fund investments, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends, debt refinancing or extraordinary actions or that counterparties in any such financings would honor their contractual commitments. If financing is not available when needed or is not available on favorable terms, our company may be unable to complete acquisitions, repurchase equity or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of our company. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution.\nOur company has significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nAs discussed above, we entered into the Margin Loan Agreement as the guarantor with TripSPV as the borrower, pursuant to which TripSPV had outstanding borrowings of $355 million at December 31, 2019, including paid in kind interest. As a result of this significant indebtedness, our company may:\n\u25cf Experience increased vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf Be required to dedicate a substantial portion of its available cash to make payments on its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes (and we further note that, in the case of our company, we have a limited amount of cash and do not have access to the cash of Tripadvisor as a result of the significant non-controlling interest in Tripadvisor);\n\u25cf Be handicapped in its ability to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for its businesses;\n\u25cf Be limited in its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its businesses and the markets in which it operates;\n\u25cf Possibly be placed at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt;\n\u25cf Be exposed to the risk of increased interest rates with respect to any variable rate portion of its indebtedness; and\n\u25cf Be limited in its ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow funds at rates or on other terms that it finds acceptable.\nIn addition, it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business. However, there is no assurance that additional financing will be available to our company on terms favorable to us, if at all. If new debt is added to the current debt levels, the risks described above could intensify. In addition, TripSPV is prohibited from incurring additional indebtedness under the Margin Loan Agreement, and we expect our company to have limited capacity to incur indebtedness outside of TripSPV.\nAlthough Tripadvisor has substantial cash flow from operations, we have limited sources of cash and liquidity. Our cash balance is expected to enable us to fund our parent level operating expenses and debt service obligations for the foreseeable future; however, we cannot assure you that we will not experience unexpected expenses or that we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations and service our direct debt obligations during the foreseeable future. For additional information about our company\u2019s ability to potentially service our direct debt obligations, see \u201cWe are a holding company, and we could be unable in the future to obtain cash in amounts sufficient to service our financial obligations or meet our other commitments.\u201d and \u201cWe do not have access to the cash that Tripadvisor generates from its operating activities.\u201d above.\nI-11\nThe Margin Loan Agreement contains various covenants that will restrict the activities of TripSPV and could trigger an early repayment obligation.\nAs discussed above, we entered into the Margin Loan Agreement as the guarantor with TripSPV as the borrower, pursuant to which we had outstanding borrowings of $355 million, including paid in kind interest at December 31, 2019. The Margin Loan Agreement contains various covenants, including those that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf Incur indebtedness by TripSPV;\n\u25cf Enter into financing arrangements with respect to the stock of Tripadvisor; and\n\u25cf Cause TripSPV to enter into unrelated businesses or otherwise conduct business other than owning common stock or other shares of Tripadvisor.\nIn addition, as discussed above, the Margin Loan Agreement provides that, among other triggering events, if at any time the closing price per share of Tripadvisor common stock falls below certain minimum values, a partial repayment of the Margin Loan to certain specified amounts will be due and payable with respect to each such circumstance, together with accrued and unpaid interest, and if the company or TripSPV is unable to pay such amounts, the lenders may foreclose on the pledged stock of Tripadvisor that TripSPV holds and any other collateral that then secures TripSPV\u2019s obligations under the Margin Loan Agreement, which would materially adversely affect our asset composition and financial condition.\nAny failure to comply with the restrictions of the Margin Loan Agreement may result in an event of default under the agreement governing such facility. Such default may allow the applicable creditors to accelerate the debt incurred thereunder. For additional information regarding the potential impact of the restrictions in this debt arrangement, see \u201cOur company may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing, or refinance our existing indebtedness, on acceptable terms.\u201d\nOur company has overlapping directors and officers with Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, LBC and GCI Liberty, which may lead to conflicting interests.\nAs a result of the TripCo Spin-Off and other transactions between 2011 and 2018 that resulted in the separate corporate existence of Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, LBC and GCI Liberty, most of our executive officers also serve as executive officers of Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, LBC and GCI Liberty and there are overlapping directors. Other than GCI Liberty\u2019s current ownership of shares of LBC\u2019s non-voting Series C common stock, none of the foregoing companies has any ownership interest in any of the others. Our executive officers and members of our company\u2019s board of directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, LBC, GCI Liberty or any other public company have fiduciary duties to that company\u2019s stockholders. For example, there may be the potential for a conflict of interest when our company, Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, LBC or GCI Liberty looks at acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be suitable for each of them. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting more than one of the companies to which they owe fiduciary duties. Moreover, many of our company\u2019s directors and officers own Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, LBC and/or GCI Liberty stock and equity awards. These ownership interests could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when the applicable individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for our company, Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, LBC and GCI Liberty. Each of our company, LBC and GCI Liberty has renounced its rights to certain business opportunities and their respective restated certificate of incorporation provides that no director or officer of the respective company will breach their fiduciary duty and therefore be liable to the respective company or its stockholders by reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to another person or entity (including Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, LBC, GCI Liberty and TripCo, as the case may be) instead of the respective company, or does not refer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to the respective company, unless (x) such opportunity was expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the respective company or as a director or officer of any of the respective company\u2019s subsidiaries, and (y) such opportunity relates to a line of business in which the respective company or any of its subsidiaries is then directly engaged. In addition, any potential conflict that qualifies as a \u201crelated party transaction\u201d (as defined in Item 404 of Regulation S-K) is subject to review by an independent committee of the applicable issuer\u2019s board of directors in accordance with its corporate governance guidelines. Any other potential conflicts that arise\nI-12\nwill be addressed on a case-by-case basis, keeping in mind the applicable fiduciary duties owed by the executive officers and directors of each issuer. From time to time, we may enter into transactions with Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, LBC, GCI Liberty and/or their subsidiaries or other affiliates. There can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favorable to our company, Qurate Retail, Liberty Media, LBC, GCI Liberty or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates as would be the case where there is no overlapping officer or director.\nCertain of our inter-company agreements were negotiated while we were a subsidiary of Qurate Retail.\nWe entered into a number of inter-company agreements covering matters such as tax sharing and our responsibility for certain liabilities previously undertaken by Qurate Retail for certain of our businesses. In addition, we entered into a services agreement with Liberty Media pursuant to which it provides to us certain management, administrative, financial, treasury, accounting, tax, legal and other services, for which we pay Liberty Media a services fee, and pursuant to a recent amendment to the services agreement, components of our President and Chief Executive Officer\u2019s compensation will either be paid directly to him by our company or reimbursed to Liberty Media, in each case, based on the allocation set forth in the amendment. The terms of all of these agreements (other than the amendment to the services agreement relating to Mr. Maffei\u2019s compensation) were established while we were a wholly owned subsidiary of Qurate Retail, and hence may not be the result of arms\u2019 length negotiations. Although we believe that the negotiations with Liberty Media were at arms\u2019 length, the persons negotiating on behalf of Liberty Media also serve as officers of Qurate Retail, as described above. We believe that the terms of these inter-company agreements are commercially reasonable and fair to all parties under the circumstances; however, conflicts could arise in the interpretation or any extension or renegotiation of the foregoing agreements.\nGoodwill and other identifiable intangible assets, specifically trademarks, represent a significant portion of our total assets, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had intangible assets not subject to amortization, which consisted of goodwill and trademarks, of approximately $3,507 million, which represented approximately 74% of total assets as of December 31, 2019. These intangible assets were recorded in connection with our acquisition of a controlling interest in Tripadvisor in 2012 and subsequent acquisitions by Tripadvisor. We perform our annual assessment of the recoverability of our goodwill and other non-amortizable intangible assets during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. Impairments may result from, among other things, deterioration in financial and operational performance, declines in stock price, increased attrition, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and/or regulations, deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, increased competitive markets in which Tripadvisor operates in, declining financial performance over a sustained period, changes in key personnel and/or strategy, and a variety of other factors.\nDue to deteriorations in revenue, impairment losses of $288 million and $527 million were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2017, respectively, related to trademarks. The trademarks were related to the hotels, media & platform reporting unit in 2019 and the legacy hotels reporting unit in 2017, which is now included in the hotels, media & platform reporting unit. Due to certain marketplace factors impacting Tripadvisor\u2019s operating results, which led to a decline in Tripadvisor\u2019s stock price, an impairment loss of $1,271 million was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 related to goodwill, related to the legacy hotels reporting unit, which is now included in the hotels, media & platform reporting unit. TripCo will continue to monitor Tripadvisor\u2019s financial performance, stock price and other events and circumstances that may negatively impact the estimated fair values to determine if an additional impairment assessment is necessary.\nThe amount of any quantified impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge to results of operations. Any impairment charge relating to goodwill or other intangible assets would have the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses in such period. At least annually, or as circumstances arise that may trigger an assessment, we will test our goodwill for impairment. There can be no assurance that our future evaluations of goodwill will not result in our recognition of impairment charges, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial statements and results of operations.\nI-13\nFactors Relating to Tripadvisor\nIf Tripadvisor is unable to continue to attract a significant amount of visitors to its websites and mobile apps and to cost-effectively convert these visitors into revenue-generating users, and to continue to engage its users, its revenue, financial results and business could be harmed.\nTripadvisor\u2019s long-term success depends on its continued ability to attract a significant number of visitors to its platforms in a cost effective manner, to convert those visitors into consumers and to then to continue to engage those consumers throughout the travel planning, booking and trip-taking phases. Tripadvisor\u2019s traffic and user engagement could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including but not limited to increased competition; inability to provide quality content, inventory or supply to its consumers; declines or inefficiencies in traffic acquisition; reduced awareness of Tripadvisor\u2019s brands; and macroeconomic conditions. Certain of Tripadvisor\u2019s competitors have advertising campaigns expressly designed to drive traffic directly to their websites, and these campaigns may negatively impact traffic to Tripadvisor\u2019s site. Tripadvisor\u2019s traffic growth could decline over time and its success could become increasingly dependent on Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to increase levels of user engagement on its platform. There can be no assurances that Tripadvisor will continue to provide content and products in a manner that meets rapidly changing demand. Any failure to obtain and manage content and products in a cost-effective manner that will engage users, or any failure to provide content and products that are perceived as useful, reliable and trustworthy, could adversely affect user experiences and their repeat behavior, reduce traffic to its websites and negatively impact its business and financial performance.\nTripadvisor relies on Internet search engines and application marketplaces to drive traffic to its platform, certain providers of which offer products and services that compete directly with its products. If links to its websites and apps are not displayed prominently, traffic to Tripadvisor\u2019s platform could decline and its business would be negatively affected.\nTripadvisor relies heavily on Internet search engines to generate a significant amount of traffic to its websites, principally through search engine marketing, or SEM (i.e., the purchase of travel-related keywords) as well as through search engine optimization, or SEO (i.e., free, or organic, search). The number of consumers Tripadvisor attracts from search engines to its platform is due in large part to how and where information from, and links to, Tripadvisor\u2019s websites are displayed on search engine results pages, or SERPs. The display, including rankings, of search results can be affected by a number of factors, many of which are not in Tripadvisor\u2019s control and may change frequently. Search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user\u2019s search, such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to Tripadvisor\u2019s websites can be negatively affected. In addition, a search engine could, for competitive or other purposes, alter its search algorithms or results causing Tripadvisor\u2019s websites to place lower in search query results. If a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking of Tripadvisor\u2019s websites or those of its travel partners, or if competitive dynamics impact the cost or effectiveness of SEO or SEM in a negative manner, Tripadvisor\u2019s business and financial performance would be adversely affected. Furthermore, Tripadvisor\u2019s failure to successfully manage its SEO and SEM strategies and/or other traffic acquisition strategies could result in a substantial decrease in traffic to its websites, as well as increased costs to the extent Tripadvisor replaces free traffic with paid traffic.\nIn some instances, search and metasearch companies and application marketplaces may change their displays or rankings in order to promote their own competing products or services or the products or services of one or more of Tripadvisor\u2019s competitors. For example, Google, a significant source of traffic to Tripadvisor\u2019s website accounting for a substantial portion of the visits to its websites, frequently promotes its own competing products in its web search results, which has negatively impacted placement of references to Tripadvisor\u2019s company and its website on the SERP. Google\u2019s promotion of its own competing products, or similar actions by Google in the future that have the effect of reducing Tripadvisor\u2019s prominence or ranking on its search results, could have a substantial negative effect on its business and results of operations.\nTripadvisor also relies on application marketplaces, or app stores such as Apple\u2019s App Store and Google\u2019s Play, to drive downloads of its applications. In the future, Apple, Google or other marketplace operators may make changes to their marketplaces that make access to Tripadvisor\u2019s products more difficult. For example, Google has entered various aspects of the online travel market, including by establishing a flight metasearch product and a hotel metasearch product,\nI-14\nas well as reservation functionality. Tripadvisor\u2019s applications may receive unfavorable treatment compared to the promotion and placement of competing applications, such as the order in which they appear within marketplaces. Similarly, if problems arise in Tripadvisor\u2019s relationships with providers of application marketplaces, traffic to its site and its user growth could be harmed.\nTripadvisor derives a substantial portion of its revenue from advertising and any significant reduction in spending by advertisers or redirections of advertising spend could harm its business. In addition, Tripadvisor relies on a relatively small number of significant advertising partners and any reduction in spending by or loss of these partners could seriously harm its business.\nTripadvisor derives a substantial portion of its revenue from the sale of advertising, primarily through click-based advertising and, to a lesser extent, display-based and subscription-based advertising. Tripadvisor enters into advertising contracts with its advertising partners; however, the agreement terms are generally limited to legal matters, with campaign details and economics governed by insertion orders, and most of these contracts can be terminated by its partners at will or on short notice. Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to grow advertising revenue with its existing or new advertising partners is dependent in large part on its ability to generate revenue for them relative to other alternatives. Advertisers will not continue to do business with Tripadvisor if their investment in such advertising does not generate sales leads, customers, bookings, or revenue and profit on a cost-effective basis. Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to provide value to its advertising partners depends on a number of factors, including effectiveness of online advertising, competitiveness of its products, traffic quality, perception of its platform, availability and accuracy of analytics and measurement solutions to demonstrate its value, and macroeconomic conditions, whether in the advertising industry generally, among specific types of marketers or within particular geographies. Tripadvisor cannot guarantee that its current advertisers will fulfill their obligations under existing contracts, continue to advertise beyond the terms of existing contracts or enter into any additional contracts with it.\nIn addition, advertising revenue could be impacted by a number of other factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf Tripadvisor\u2019s inability to increase or maintain user engagement;\n\u25cf Tripadvisor\u2019s inability to increase or maintain the quantity and quality of ads shown to consumers, including as a result of technical infrastructure constraints;\n\u25cf The development of technologies that can block the display of Tripadvisor\u2019s ads or block its ad measurement tools, particularly for advertising displayed on tablets and/or on mobile platforms;\n\u25cf The effectiveness of Tripadvisor\u2019s ad targeting or degree to which consumers opt out of certain types of ad targeting;\n\u25cf Adverse government actions or legal developments relating to advertising, including legislative and regulatory developments and developments in litigation that limit Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to deliver or target advertising; and\n\u25cf The impact of macroeconomic conditions, whether in the advertising industry in general or among special types of marketers or within particular geographies.\nThe occurrence of any of these or other factors could result in a reduction in demand for Tripadvisor\u2019s ads, which may reduce the prices it receives for ads, or cause marketers to stop advertising with Tripadvisor altogether, either of which would negatively affect Tripadvisor\u2019s revenue and financial results.\nClick-based advertising revenue accounts for the majority of Tripadvisor\u2019s advertising revenue. Tripadvisor\u2019s CPC pricing for click-based advertising depends, in part, on competition between advertisers. If its large advertisers become less competitive with each other, merge with each other or with its competitors, focus more on per-click profit than on traffic volume, or are able to reduce CPCs, this could have an adverse impact on Tripadvisor\u2019s click-based advertising revenue which would, in turn, have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nI-15\nTripadvisor derives a substantial portion of its revenue from a relatively small number of advertising partners and relies significantly on these relationships. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2019, Tripadvisor\u2019s two most significant advertising partners, Expedia and Booking Holdings, accounted for a combined 33% of total revenue. While Tripadvisor enters into master advertising contracts with its partners, as discussed above, most of these contracts can be terminated by its partners at will or on short notice. If any of its significant advertisers were to cease or significantly curtail advertising on Tripadvisor\u2019s websites, Tripadvisor could experience a rapid decline in its revenue over a relatively short period of time which would have a material impact on its business.\nTripadvisor\u2019s business depends on a strong brand and any failure to maintain, protect and enhance its brand could hurt its ability to retain and expand its base of consumers and partners, as well as increase the frequency with which consumers utilize its products and services.\nTripadvisor believes that the strength of its brands (particularly the Tripadvisor brand) has contributed significantly to its success. Tripadvisor also believes that maintaining, protecting and enhancing its brands is critical to expanding its base of consumers, increasing the frequency with which consumers utilize its solutions and attracting advertisers and business partners. Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to maintain and protect its brand depends, in part, on its ability to maintain consumer trust in its products and in the quality, integrity, reliability of usefulness of the content and other information found on its platform. For example, if consumers do not view Tripadvisor\u2019s reviews to be useful and reliable, they may seek other sources to obtain the information they are looking for and may not return to Tripadvisor\u2019s platform as often in the future, or at all. This would negatively impact Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to attract and retain consumers and partners and the frequency with which they use its platform.\nTripadvisor dedicates significant resources to these goals, primarily through its computer algorithms and teams of moderators that are focused on identifying inappropriate, unreliable or deceptive content. Tripadvisor removes those types of content from its website and, in certain cases, takes legal action against individuals or businesses that it believes have engaged in deceptive practices.\nMedia, legislative or regulatory scrutiny of Tripadvisor\u2019s decisions regarding user privacy, content, advertising, and other issues may adversely affect its reputation and brands. Negative publicity about Tripadvisor, including its content, technology, business practices or strategic plans, could diminish Tripadvisor\u2019s reputation and confidence in Tripadvisor\u2019s brand, thereby negatively affecting the use of its products and potentially even Tripadvisor\u2019s share price. For example, certain media outlets have alleged that Tripadvisor has improperly filtered or screened reviews, that it has not properly verified reviews, or that Tripadvisor manipulates reviews, ranking and ratings in favor of its advertisers against non-advertisers. Tripadvisor expends significant resources to ensure the integrity of its reviews and to ensure that the most relevant reviews are available to its consumers; Tripadvisor does not establish rankings and ratings in favor of its advertisers. Nevertheless, Tripadvisor\u2019s reputation and brand, the traffic to its platform, its business and potentially even Tripadvisor\u2019s share price may suffer from negative publicity about Tripadvisor or if consumers otherwise perceive that its content is manipulated or biased. In addition, regulatory inquiries or investigations require management time and attention and could result in further negative publicity, regardless of their merits or ultimate outcomes.\nIn addition, unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, Tripadvisor\u2019s practices relating to privacy and data protection, product changes, competitive pressures, litigation or regulatory activity could adversely affect Tripadvisor\u2019s reputation with its consumers and its partners. Such negative publicity also could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement, and loyalty of its user base and result in decreased revenue.\nTripadvisor continues to invest significant time and effort towards educating users about its brand and its product offerings and there can be no assurances that these efforts will continue to be successful.\nIn an effort to enhance its brand, Tripadvisor invests significantly in brand marketing, including, but not limited to, television advertising. Tripadvisor expects these investments to continue, and potentially even increase, as a result of a variety of factors, including relatively high levels of advertising spending by competitors, the increasing costs of supporting multiple brands, expansion into new geographies, product positioning where Tripadvisor\u2019s brands are less well known and the continued emergence and relative traffic share growth of search engines as destination sites for travelers. Tripadvisor expects to continue its television advertising campaign and to adjust its marketing efforts and spend among\nI-16\nthe different marketing channels, in each case as Tripadvisor thinks appropriate based on the relative growth opportunity, the expected returns and the competitive environment in the different businesses in which Tripadvisor operates.\nSuch efforts may not maintain or enhance consumer awareness of Tripadvisor\u2019s brands and, even if Tripadvisor is successful in its branding efforts, such efforts may not be cost-effective or as efficient as they have been historically. If Tripadvisor is unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of its brands or to generate demand in a cost-effective manner, it would have a material adverse effect on Tripadvisor\u2019s business and financial performance. In addition, there are no assurances that these actions will have a positive impact on Tripadvisor\u2019s marketing efficiencies or operating margins or when the financial benefit expected to result from these efforts will exceed the costs of such efforts. Furthermore, some of Tripadvisor\u2019s current and potential competitors have access to significantly greater and more diverse resources than Tripadvisor does, and they may also be able to leverage other aspects of their businesses to enable them to compete more effectively with Tripadvisor.\nConsumer adoption and use of mobile devices creates new challenges. If Tripadvisor is unable to operate effectively on these platforms or its products for such devices are not compelling, its business may be adversely affected.\nWidespread adoption of mobile devices, such as the iPhone, Android-enabled smartphones and tablets, such as the iPad, coupled with web browsing functionality and development of thousands of useful apps available on these devices, is driving substantial online traffic and commerce to mobile platforms. Tripadvisor has experienced a significant shift of business to mobile platforms and its advertising partners are also experiencing a rapid shift of traffic to mobile platforms. Tripadvisor anticipates that the rate of use of these devices will continue to grow. The functionality and user experience associated with these alternative devices, such as a smaller screen size or lack of a screen, may make the use of Tripadvisor\u2019s platform through such devices more difficult. Tripadvisor\u2019s websites and apps, when utilized on mobile phone devices, monetize at a significantly lower rate than desktops and advertising opportunities are more limited on these mobile devices. Additionally, consumer purchasing patterns differ on alternative devices. For example, accommodation reservations made on a mobile device typically are for shorter lengths of stay and are not made as far in advance. Mobile consumers may also be unwilling to download multiple apps from multiple companies providing similar services or contribute high quality content through such devices. As a result, the consumer experience with mobile apps and brand recognition are likely to become increasingly important. Tripadvisor expects that the ways in which consumers engage with its platform will continue to change over time as consumers increasingly engage via alternative devices.\nIt is increasingly important for Tripadvisor to develop and maintain effective platforms to drive adoption and user engagement by providing consumers with an appealing, easy-to-use experience. As new devices and platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the problems Tripadvisor may encounter in adapting its products and services to them - and developing competitive new products and services - and Tripadvisor may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support and maintenance of such products. If Tripadvisor is unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new, user-friendly and differentiated offerings and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platforms, or if Tripadvisor\u2019s offerings are not used by consumers, Tripadvisor could lose market share and its business, future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTripadvisor\u2019s success will also depend on the interoperability of its products with a range of technologies, systems, networks and standards or in creating, maintaining and developing relationships with key participants in related industries, some of which may be Tripadvisor\u2019s competitors. For example, Google\u2019s Android and Apple\u2019s iPhone are the leading smartphones in the world; therefore, Tripadvisor\u2019s products need to synergistically function on their respective operating systems in order to create a positive user experience on a mobile device. However, Google could leverage its Android operating system to give its travel services a competitive advantage, either technically or with prominence on its Google Play app store or within its mobile search results. Similarly, Apple obtained a patent for \u201ciTravel,\u201d a mobile app that would allow a traveler to check in for a travel reservation. In addition, Apple\u2019s iPhone operating system includes \u201cWallet,\u201d a virtual wallet app that holds tickets, boarding passes, coupons and gift cards, and, along with iTravel, may be indicative of Apple\u2019s intent to enter the travel reservations business in some capacity. Apple has substantial market share in the smartphone category and controls integration of offerings, including travel services, into its mobile operating system. Apple also has more experience producing and developing mobile apps and has access to greater resources than Tripadvisor does. Apple may use or expand iTravel, Wallet, Siri (Apple\u2019s voice recognition \u201cconcierge\u201d service), Apple Pay (Apple\u2019s mobile payment system) or another mobile app or functionality as a means of entering the travel reservations\nI-17\nmarketplace. To the extent Google or Apple use their mobile operating systems, app distribution channels or, in the case of Google, search services, to favor their own travel service offerings, there may be an adverse effect on Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to compete in the mobile space. Tripadvisor may not be successful in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, systems, networks and standards or in creating, maintaining and developing relationships with key participants in related industries. If Tripadvisor experiences difficulties or increased costs in integrating its products into alternative devices, or if manufacturers elect not to include its products in their devices, make changes that degrade the functionality of its products, give preferential treatment to competitive products or prevent Tripadvisor from delivering advertising, Tripadvisor\u2019s user growth and results of operations may be harmed. This risk may be exacerbated by the frequency with which consumers change or upgrade their devices. In the event consumers choose devices that do not already include or support Tripadvisor\u2019s platform or do not install its products when they change or upgrade their devices, Tripadvisor\u2019s traffic and user engagement may be harmed.\nIn addition, the market for advertising products on mobile and other devices is rapidly evolving. As new devices and platforms are released, consumers may begin consuming content in a manner that is more difficult to monetize. Similarly, as advertising products for mobile and other platforms develop, demand may increase for products that Tripadvisor does not offer or that may alienate its user base, which it must balance against its commitment to prioritizing the quality of user experience over short-term monetization. If Tripadvisor is not able to balance these competing considerations successfully to develop compelling advertising products, advertisers may stop or reduce their advertising with Tripadvisor and Tripadvisor may not be able to generate meaningful revenue from alternative devices despite the expected growth in their usage.\nDeclines or disruptions in the economy in general and the travel industry, in particular, could adversely affect Tripadvisor\u2019s businesses and financial performance.\nTripadvisor\u2019s businesses and financial performance are affected by the health of the global economy generally as well as the travel industry and leisure travel in particular. Sales of travel services tend to decline or grow more slowly during economic downturns and recessions when consumers engage in less discretionary spending, are concerned about unemployment or economic weakness, have reduced access to credit or experience other concerns that reduce their ability or willingness to travel. The global economy may be adversely impacted by unforeseen events beyond Tripadvisor\u2019s control, including incidents of actual or threatened terrorism, regional hostilities or instability, unusual weather patterns, natural disasters, political instability and health concerns (including epidemics or pandemics), defaults on government debt, significant increases in fuel and energy costs, tax increases and other matters that could reduce discretionary spending, tightening of credit markets and declines in consumer confidence. Decreased travel spending could reduce the demand for Tripadvisor\u2019s services and have a negative impact on its business and financial performance.\nIn addition, the uncertainty of macro-economic factors and their impact on consumer behavior, which may differ across regions, makes it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trends and the timing and degree of their impact on Tripadvisor\u2019s markets and business, which in turn could adversely affect Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to effectively manage its business and its results of operations.\nFor example, since the United Kingdom (the \u201cU.K.\u201d) initiated the process to exit the European Union (the \u201cE.U.\u201d), known as Brexit, global markets and foreign exchange rates have experienced increased volatility, including a decline in the value of the British pound as compared to the U.S. Dollar. Tripadvisor has significant operations in both the U.K. and the E.U. Tripadvisor\u2019s operations and those of its merchants are highly integrated across the U.K. and the E.U. and are highly dependent on the free flow of labor and goods in those regions. Although the U.K. ceased to be a member of the E.U. on January 31, 2020, the U.K. and E.U. will continue to work on the terms of the departure through a transition period ending December 31, 2020. As a result, there remains significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. The ongoing uncertainty and potential outcomes could negatively impact Tripadvisor\u2019s merchant and customer relationships and financial performance. In addition, uncertainty could continue to adversely affect consumer confidence and spending in the U.K. Tripadvisor could face new regulatory costs and challenges when the final terms of the governing relationships and final U.K. regulations are determined. Since the final terms of that exit and the U.K. regulatory environment are uncertain, Tripadvisor is unable to predict the effect Brexit will have on its business and results of operations.\nI-18\nAs another example, Tripadvisor\u2019s financial results may be negatively impacted by the 2019 Novel Coronavirus outbreak. The extent and duration of such impacts remain largely uncertain and dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the coronavirus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken and the impact of these and other factors on travel behavior.\nTripadvisor operates in an increasingly competitive global environment and its failure to compete effectively could reduce its market share and harm its financial performance.\nTripadvisor competes in a rapidly evolving and competitive industry. It faces competition for content, consumers, advertisers, online travel search and price comparison services, or what is known in the industry as metasearch, and online reservations. Tripadvisor competes globally with both online and offline, established and emerging, providers of travel, lodging, experiences and restaurant reservation and related services. The markets for the services Tripadvisor offers are intensely competitive, and current and new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost.\nTripadvisor also competes with different types of companies in the various markets and geographies where it operates, including large and small companies in the travel space as well as broader service providers. More specifically:\n\u25cf Tripadvisor\u2019s Hotels, Media & Platform segment faces competition, and in some cases partners with, the following businesses: OTAs (including Expedia and Booking Holdings and many of their respective subsidiaries and operating companies); hotel metasearch providers (including trivago, Kayak and HotelsCombined, subsidiaries of Booking Holdings and Trip.com Group Limited, formerly known as Ctrip.com International, Ltd.); large online search, social media, and marketplace platform and companies (including Google, FaceBook, Microsoft\u2019s Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, Alibaba, and Amazon); and traditional offline travel agencies, and global hotel chains seeking to promote direct bookings.\n\u25cf Tripadvisor also faces competition from different companies in each of the Experiences & Dining segment businesses. Experiences competes with online travel agencies, such as Airbnb, Booking Holdings, GetYourGuide and Klook; traditional travel agencies; online travel service providers; and wholesalers, among others. Dining competes with other online restaurant reservation services, such as SeatMe (owned by Yelp) and OpenTable (a subsidiary of Booking Holdings).\nThere has been a proliferation of new channels through which providers can offer accommodations, experiences and restaurant reservations. Metasearch services may lower the cost for new companies to enter the market by providing a distribution channel without the cost of promoting the new entrant\u2019s brand to drive consumers directly to its website. Some of Tripadvisor\u2019s competitors and potential competitors offer a variety of online services, many of which are used by competitors more frequently than online travel services. In addition, in some cases, Tripadvisor\u2019s competitors are willing to make little or no profit on a transaction, or offer travel services at a loss, in order to gain market share. Many of Tripadvisor\u2019s competitors (such as Google, Booking Holdings and Trip.com Group Limited) have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than Tripadvisor and have more expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating Internet traffic as well as large client bases. They also have the ability to leverage other aspects of their business to enable them to compete more effectively against Tripadvisor. For example, Google has entered various aspects of the online travel market, including by establishing a flight metasearch product (\"Google Flights\") and a hotel metasearch product (\"Google Hotel Ads\") that are growing rapidly, as well as its \"Book on Google\" reservation functionality and its Google Trips app.\nIn addition, Google and other large, established companies with substantial resources and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating Internet traffic have launched travel or travel-related search, metasearch and/or reservation booking services and may create additional inroads into online travel. Google's travel metasearch services, Google Hotel Ads and Google Flights, are growing rapidly and have achieved significant market share in a relatively short time. In addition, many of Tripadvisor\u2019s competitors, including online search companies, continue to expand their voice and artificial intelligence capabilities, which may provide them with a competitive advantage in travel. Tripadvisor cannot provide assurance that it will be able to compete successfully against its current, emerging and future competitors or on platforms that may emerge, or provide differentiated products and services to its traveler base.\nI-19\nTripadvisor competes with certain companies that Tripadvisor also does business with, including some of its click-based advertising travel partners. The consolidation of Tripadvisor\u2019s competitors and travel partners, including Expedia (through its acquisitions of Orbitz, Travelocity, and HomeAway) and Booking Holdings (through its acquisitions of KAYAK and OpenTable), may affect Tripadvisor\u2019s relative competitiveness and its travel partner relationships. Competition and consolidation could result in higher traffic acquisition costs, reduced margins on Tripadvisor\u2019s advertising services, loss of market share, reduced customer traffic to its websites and reduced advertising by travel companies on its websites.\nAs the industry shifts towards online travel services and the technology supporting it continues to evolve, including platforms such as mobile phone and tablet computing devices, competition is likely to intensify. Competition in Tripadvisor\u2019s industry may result in pricing pressure, loss of market share or decreased user engagement, any of which could adversely affect its business and financial performance.\nTripadvisor relies on information technology to operate its business and remain competitive, and any failure to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm its businesses.\nTripadvisor depends on the use of sophisticated information technologies and systems for website and mobile apps, supplier connectivity, communications, reservations, payment processing, procurement, customer service and fraud prevention. Tripadvisor\u2019s future success depends on its ability to continuously improve and upgrade its systems and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while at the same time maintaining the reliability and integrity of its systems and infrastructure. Tripadvisor may not be able to maintain or replace its existing systems or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as it would like or in a cost-effective manner. Tripadvisor may not be successful, or as successful as its competitors, in developing technologies and systems that operate effectively across multiple devices and platforms in a way that is appealing to its consumers. In addition, the emergence of alternative devices such as mobile phones and tablets and the emergence of niche competitors who may be able to optimize products, services or strategies for such platforms, will require additional investment in technology. New developments in other areas could also make it easier for competitors to enter Tripadvisor\u2019s markets due to lower up-front technology costs. Technology changes, including new devices, services and home assistants, such as Amazon\u2019s Alexa Voice and Google Home, and developing technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, could negatively impact Tripadvisor\u2019s business.\nIf Tripadvisor does not continue to innovate and provide products, services and features that are useful to users, it may not remain competitive, and its business and financial performance could suffer.\nTripadvisor\u2019s success depends in part on continued innovation to provide products, features and services that make its platform compelling to users and engage its consumers. Its competitors are continually developing innovations in online travel-related services and features. As a result, Tripadvisor is continually working to improve its business model and consumer experience in order to engage its consumers and drive user traffic and conversion rates. Tripadvisor has invested, and expects to continue to invest significant resources in developing and marketing these innovations. Tripadvisor can give no assurances that the changes it makes will yield the benefits it expects and will not have unintended or adverse impacts that Tripadvisor did not anticipate. If Tripadvisor is unable to continue offering innovative products and services and quality features that users want to use, existing consumers may become dissatisfied and use competitors\u2019 offerings and it may be unable to attract additional consumers, which could adversely affect its business and financial performance.\nTripadvisor\u2019s dedication to making the user experience its highest priority may cause it to prioritize rapid innovation and user experience over short-term financial results.\nTripadvisor strives to create the best experience for its users, providing them with the information, products and tools to enable them to plan, book and experience the perfect trip. Tripadvisor believes that in doing so it will increase its rates of conversion, revenuer and, ultimately, its financial performance over the long-term. Tripadvisor has taken actions in the past and may continue to make decisions in the future that have the effect of reducing its short-term revenue or profitability if it believes that the decisions benefit the overall user experience. For example, Tripadvisor may introduce new products or changes to existing products or the user experience that decrease rates of conversion but increases revenue. In addition, Tripadvisor\u2019s approach of putting users first may negatively impact its relationship with existing or prospective\nI-20\npartners. These actions and practices could result in a loss of partners, which in turn could harm Tripadvisor\u2019s results of operations. The short-term reductions in revenue or profitability could be more severe than Tripadvisor anticipates or these decisions may not produce the long-term benefits that Tripadvisor expects, in which case its user growth and engagement, its relationships with consumers and travel partners, and its business and results of operations could be harmed. In addition, if new or enhanced products fail to engage users or if Tripadvisor is unsuccessful in its effort to monetize these initiatives, Tripadvisor may fail to generate sufficient revenue, profit margin or other value to justify its investments, in which case Tripadvisor\u2019s business and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nTripadvisor is dependent upon the quality of traffic in its network to provide value to Tripadvisor\u2019s partners, and any failure in its ability to deliver quality traffic and/or the metrics to demonstrate the value of the traffic could have a material adverse effect on the value of its websites to its partners and adversely affect its revenue.\nTripadvisor uses technology and processes to monitor the quality of the Internet traffic that it delivers to its partners and has identified metrics to demonstrate the quality of that traffic. These metrics are used to not only identify the value of advertising on Tripadvisor\u2019s website, but also to identify low quality clicks such as non-human processes, including robots, spiders or other software; the mechanical automation of clicking; and other types of invalid clicks or click fraud. Even with such monitoring in place, there is a risk that a certain amount of low-quality traffic, or traffic that online advertisers deem to be invalid, will be delivered to such online advertisers. As a result, Tripadvisor may be required to credit amounts owed to it by its partners. Furthermore, low-quality or invalid traffic may be detrimental to Tripadvisor\u2019s relationships with partners, and could adversely affect its advertising pricing and revenue.\nTripadvisor relies on assumptions and estimates and data to calculate certain of its key metrics, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm Tripadvisor\u2019s reputation and negatively affect its business.\nTripadvisor believes certain metrics are key to Tripadvisor\u2019s business. As both the industry in which Tripadvisor operates and its businesses continue to evolve, so too might the metrics by which Tripadvisor evaluates its businesses and the company. In addition, while the calculation of the metrics Tripadvisor uses is based on what Tripadvisor believes to be reasonable estimates, Tripadvisor\u2019s internal tools are not independently verified by a third party and have a number of limitations and, furthermore, its methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time. For example, a single person may have multiple accounts or browse the Internet on multiple browsers or devices, some consumers may restrict Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to accurately identify them across visits, some mobile apps automatically contact its servers for regular updates with no user action, and it is not always able to capture user information on all of its platforms. As such, the calculations of its unique visitors may not accurately reflect the number of people actually visiting its platforms. Tripadvisor continues to improve upon its tools and methodologies to capture data and believes that its current metrics are accurate; however, the improvement of its tools and methodologies could cause inconsistency between current data and previously reported data, which could confuse investors or lead to questions about the integrity of its data. Also, if the internal tools Tripadvisor uses to track these metrics under-count or over-count performance or contain algorithm or other technical errors, the data Tripadvisor reports may not be accurate. Finally, Tripadvisor may, in the future, identify new or other metrics that enable it to more accurately evaluate its business. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on these metrics.\nTripadvisor relies on the performance of highly skilled personnel and, if it is unable to retain or motivate key personnel, or hire, retain and motivate qualified personnel, Tripadvisor\u2019s business would be harmed.\nTripadvisor\u2019s future success is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. In particular, the contributions of Stephen Kaufer, Tripadvisor\u2019s co-founder, Chief Executive Officer and President, the contributions of key senior management and the contributions of software engineers and other technology professionals, are critical to its overall management and the success of its business. Tripadvisor cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of its existing key personnel, and the loss of one or more of its key personnel could seriously harm its business. Tripadvisor does not maintain any key person life insurance policies.\nIn addition, competition remains intense for well-qualified employees in certain aspects of Tripadvisor\u2019s business, including software engineers, developers, product management and development personnel, and other technology professionals. Tripadvisor\u2019s continued ability to compete effectively depends on its ability to attract new employees and\nI-21\nto retain and motivate existing employees. As a global company, Tripadvisor aims to attract quality employees from all over the world, so any restrictions on travel for professional or personal purposes, may cause significant disruption to Tripadvisor\u2019s businesses or negatively affect its ability to attract and retain employees on a global basis. If Tripadvisor does not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining or motivating existing employees, its business would be adversely affected.\nAcquisitions, investments, significant commercial arrangements and/or new business strategies could disrupt Tripadvisor\u2019s ongoing business and present new challenges and risks.\nTripadvisor\u2019s success will depend, in part, on its ability to expand its product offerings in order to grow its business in response to changing technologies, user and travel partner demands and competitive pressures. As a result, Tripadvisor has acquired, invested in and/or entered into significant commercial arrangements with a number of new businesses in the past and its future growth may depend, in part, on future acquisitions, investments, commercial arrangements and/or changes in business strategies. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf Expected and unexpected costs incurred in identifying and pursuing these endeavors, and performing due diligence on potential targets that may or may not be successful;\n\u25cf Use of cash resources and incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities in funding these endeavors that may limit other potential uses of Tripadvisor\u2019s cash, including product development, stock repurchases and/or dividend payments;\n\u25cf Amortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets and other adverse accounting consequences;\n\u25cf Diversion of Tripadvisor\u2019s management\u2019s attention or other resources from its existing business;\n\u25cf Difficulties and expenses in integrating the operations, products, technology, privacy protection systems, information systems or personnel of the company, including the assimilation of corporate cultures;\n\u25cf Difficulties in implementing and retaining uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems;\n\u25cf The assumption of known and unknown debt and liabilities of the acquired company, including costs associated with litigation, cybersecurity risks, and other claims relating to the acquired company;\n\u25cf Failure of any company which Tripadvisor has acquired, in which it has invested, or with which it has a commercial arrangement, to achieve anticipated revenue, earnings or cash flows or to retain key management or employees;\n\u25cf Failure to generate adequate returns on acquisitions and investments;\n\u25cf With respect to minority investments, limited management or operational control and reputational risk, which risk is heightened if the controlling person in such case has business interests, strategies or goals that are inconsistent with those of Tripadvisor;\n\u25cf Entrance into markets in which Tripadvisor has no direct prior experience and increased complexity in its business;\n\u25cf Impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets such as trademarks or other intellectual property arising from acquisitions; and\n\u25cf Adverse market reaction to acquisitions.\nTripadvisor has invested, and may in the future invest, in privately-held companies and these investments are currently accounted for using the measurement alternative for equity investments without a readily determinable fair value, which measures these investments at cost while subtracting any impairments, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Such investments are inherently risky in that such companies are typically at an early stage of development, may have no or\nI-22\nlimited revenue, may not be or may never become profitable, may not be able to secure additional funding or their technologies, services or products may not be successfully developed or introduced into the market. Further, Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to liquidate any such investments is typically dependent upon some liquidity event, such as a public offering or acquisition, since no public market exists for such securities. Valuations of such privately-held companies are inherently complex and uncertain due to the lack of liquid market for the company\u2019s securities. Moreover, Tripadvisor could lose the full amount of any of its investments and any impairment of its investments could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nTripadvisor cannot assure you that these investments will be successful or that such endeavors will result in the realization of the full benefits of synergies, cost savings, innovation and operational efficiencies that may be possible or that Tripadvisor will achieve these benefits within a reasonable period of time.\nIf Tripadvisor fails to manage its growth effectively, its brand, results of operations and business could be harmed.\nOver the years, Tripadvisor has experienced rapid growth in some areas of it business, including through acquisitions of other businesses and in new international markets. Tripadvisor continues to make substantial investments in its technology, product and sales, and marketing organizations. This growth places substantial demands on Tripadvisor\u2019s management and its operational infrastructure. In addition, as Tripadvisor\u2019s business matures, it makes periodic changes and adjustments to its organization in response to various internal and external considerations, including market opportunities, the competitive landscape, new and enhanced products and acquisitions. These changes may result in a temporary lack of focus or productivity or otherwise impact Tripadvisor\u2019s business.\nTo manage its growth, Tripadvisor may need to improve its operational, financial and management systems and processes which may require significant capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources. As Tripadvisor continues to grow, it must effectively integrate, develop and motivate a large number of new employees, including employees in international markets, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of its company culture. If Tripadvisor does not manage the growth of its business and operations effectively, the quality of its platform and efficiency of its operations could suffer, which could harm its brand, results of operations and business.\nTripadvisor is a global company that operates in many different jurisdictions and these operations expose Tripadvisor to additional risks, which risks increase as its business continues to expand.\nTripadvisor operates in a number of jurisdictions both inside and outside of the United States and continues to expand its operations both domestically and internationally. Many regions have different economic conditions, languages, currencies, consumer expectations, legislation, regulatory environments (including labor laws and customs), tax laws, levels of consumer acceptance and use of the Internet for commerce and levels of political stability. Tripadvisor is subject to associated risks typical of global businesses, including but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf Compliance with additional laws and regulations (including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (or GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (or CCPA)), data privacy requirements, labor and employment law, laws regarding advertisements and promotions and anti-competition regulations;\n\u25cf Diminished ability to legally enforce contractual rights;\n\u25cf Increased risk and limits on enforceability of intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf Restrictions on repatriation of cash as well as restrictions on investments in operations in certain countries;\n\u25cf Financial risk arising from transactions in multiple currencies, as well as foreign currency exchange restrictions;\n\u25cf Difficulties in managing staff and operations due to distance, time zones, language and cultural differences;\n\u25cf Uncertainty regarding liability for services, content and intellectual property rights, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of precedent;\nI-23\n\u25cf Economic or political instability or laws and regulations involving economic or trade prohibitions or sanctions; and\n\u25cf Threatened or actual acts of terrorism.\nTripadvisor\u2019s strategy includes continued expansion in existing international and new international markets. Many of these markets have different economic conditions, customers, languages, currencies, consumer expectations, levels of consumer acceptance and use of the Internet for commerce, legislation, regulatory environments, tax laws and levels of political stability, and Tripadvisor is subject to associated risks typical of international businesses. International markets have strong local competitors with established brands and travel service providers or relationships that may make expansion in certain markets difficult and costly and take more time than anticipated. In addition, compliance with legal, regulatory or tax requirements in multiple jurisdictions places demands on Tripadvisor\u2019s time and resources, and it may nonetheless experience unforeseen and potentially adverse legal, regulatory or tax consequences. In some markets, legal and other regulatory requirements may prohibit or limit participation by foreign businesses, such as by making foreign ownership or management of Internet or travel-related businesses illegal or difficult or may make direct participation in those markets uneconomic, which could make Tripadvisor\u2019s entry or expansion in those markets difficult or impossible, require that Tripadvisor work with a local partner or result in higher operating costs. If Tripadvisor is unsuccessful in expanding in new and existing markets and effectively managing that expansion, its business and results of operations could be adversely affected. A number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). Foreign governments may enact tax laws that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect Tripadvisor\u2019s financial position and results of operations.\nThe Tax Act resulted in significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system. The Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously required under U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in the interpretation of the provisions of the Tax Act, and significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from Tripadvisor\u2019s interpretation.\nTripadvisor is regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.\nTripadvisor is regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, government investigations and other proceedings involving, among other matters, patent and intellectual property rights (including alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights), tax matters (including value-added, excise, transient, occupancy and accommodation taxes), regulatory compliance (including competition and consumer protection matters), defamation and free speech (including intermediary liability and platform immunity challenges), labor and employment matters and commercial disputes.\nSuch claims, lawsuits, government investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, any of these types of legal proceedings could have an adverse impact on Tripadvisor because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, injunctions or damage awards and other factors. Determining reserves for Tripadvisor\u2019s pending litigation or other legal proceedings is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment. It is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial damages, fines or penalties that could adversely affect Tripadvisor\u2019s business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, the release of confidential information or orders preventing Tripadvisor from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, requiring a change in Tripadvisor\u2019s business practices or other field action, or requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these consequences could adversely affect its business and results of operations.\nI-24\nA failure to comply with current laws, rules and regulations or changes to such laws, rules and regulations and other legal uncertainties may adversely affect Tripadvisor\u2019s businesses or financial performance.\nTripadvisor\u2019s business and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in, or interpretations of, existing laws, rules and regulations or the promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations applicable to Tripadvisor and its business, including those relating to Internet and online commerce, Internet advertising, consumer protection, intermediary liability, data security and privacy, travel and rental licensing and listing requirements and tax. In some cases, these laws continue to evolve.\nFor example, there is, and likely will continue to be, an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to Internet and online commerce that may relate to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the Internet, online editorial and user-generated content, user privacy, data security, behavioral targeting and online advertising, taxation, liability for third-party activities and the quality of products and services. In addition, the growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws and more aggressive enforcement efforts, which may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally. Also, evolving case law and new legislation involving worker classification, including a new law in California, increases the potential for litigation and government audits in this area and may have ramifications as to how Tripadvisor operates certain segments of its business and its engagement with independent contractors.\nFurther, Tripadvisor\u2019s Rentals business has been and continues to be subject to regulatory developments globally that affect the rental industry and the ability of companies like Tripadvisor to list those rentals online. For example, some states and local jurisdictions, both domestically and internationally, have adopted, or are considering adopting, statutes or ordinances that prohibit property owners and managers from renting certain properties on a short-term basis or otherwise limit their ability to do so, and other states and local jurisdictions may introduce similar regulations. Some states and local jurisdictions have fair housing or other laws governing whether and how properties may be rented, which they assert apply to vacation rentals. In addition, many homeowners, condominium and neighborhood associations have adopted, or are considering adopting, rules that prohibit or restrict property owners and managers from short-term rentals. Operating in this dynamic regulatory environment requires significant management attention and financial resources. Tripadvisor cannot assure that its efforts will be successful, and the investment and additional resources required to manage growth will produce the desired levels of revenue or profitability.\nTripadvisor also has been subject, and it will likely be subject in the future, to inquiries from time to time from regulatory bodies concerning compliance with consumer protection, competition, tax, data privacy and travel industry-specific laws and regulations. The failure of its businesses to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines and/or proceedings against Tripadvisor by governmental agencies, regulatory authorities, courts and/or consumers, which if material, could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, if such laws and regulations are not enforced equally against other competitors in a particular market, Tripadvisor\u2019s compliance with such laws may put it at a competitive disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis competitors who do not comply with such requirements.\nThe promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations, or the new interpretation of existing laws, rules and regulations, in each case that restrict or otherwise unfavorably impact the ability or manner in which Tripadvisor provides services could require it to change certain aspects of its business, operations and commercial relationships to ensure compliance, which could decrease demand for services, reduce revenue, increase costs and/or subject the company to additional liabilities. For example, the E.U. adopted the GDPR, effective in May 2018, implementing enhanced data protection requirements and, in 2018, the State of California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) implementing privacy rights and consumer protections for California residents. Other jurisdictions have adopted or are contemplating similar legislation. This legislation will continue to change the landscape for the use and protection of data and could increase the cost and complexity of delivering Tripadvisor\u2019s services. Unfavorable changes could decrease demand for products and services, limit marketing methods and capabilities, impede development of new products, result in negative publicity, require significant management time, increase costs and/or subject Tripadvisor to additional liabilities. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in penalties and/or criminal sanctions against Tripadvisor, its officers or its employees and/or restrictions on the conduct of parts of its business in certain jurisdictions.\nI-25\nLikewise, the SEC, Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and Office of Foreign Assets Controls (\u201cOFAC\u201d), as well as foreign regulatory authorities, have continued to increase the enforcement of economic sanctions and trade regulations, anti-money laundering, and anti-corruption laws, across industries. U.S. economic sanctions relate to transactions with designated foreign countries, including Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria and nationals and others of those countries, Ukraine/Russia related sanctions, as well as certain specifically targeted individuals and entities. Tripadvisor believes that its activities comply with OFAC, E.U., U.K. and other regulatory authorities\u2019 economic sanction and trade regulations, as well as anti-money laundering and anti-corruption regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act and the U.K. Criminal Finances Act. As regulations continue to evolve and regulatory oversight continues to increase, Tripadvisor cannot guarantee that its programs and policies will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. In the event Tripadvisor\u2019s controls should fail or are found to be out of compliance for other reasons, Tripadvisor could be subject to monetary damages, civil and criminal monetary penalties, litigation and damage to its reputation and the value of its brands.\nTripadvisor cannot be sure that its intellectual property is protected from copying or use by others, including potential competitors.\nTripadvisor\u2019s websites rely on content, brands and technology, much of which is proprietary. Tripadvisor protects its proprietary content, brands and technology by relying on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, patents and confidentiality agreements. Any misappropriation or violation of its rights could have a material adverse effect on Tripadvisor\u2019s business. Even with these precautions, it may be possible for another party to copy or otherwise obtain and use Tripadvisor\u2019s proprietary technology, content or brands without authorization or to develop similar technology, content or brands independently.\nEffective intellectual property protection is expensive to develop and maintain, both in terms of initial and ongoing registration requirements and expenses and the costs of defending Tripadvisor\u2019s rights. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every jurisdiction in which its services are made available, and policing unauthorized use of its intellectual property is difficult and expensive. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, Tripadvisor may be unable to protect its intellectual property adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect its business or ability to compete. Tripadvisor cannot be sure that the steps it has taken will prevent misappropriation or infringement of its intellectual property. Furthermore, Tripadvisor may need to go to court or other tribunals or administrative bodies in order to enforce its intellectual property rights, to protect its trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. These proceedings might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Tripadvisor\u2019s failure to protect its intellectual property in a cost-effective or effective manner could have a material adverse effect on its business and ability to protect its technology, content and brands.\nTripadvisor currently licenses from third parties and incorporates the technologies and content into its websites. As Tripadvisor continues to introduce new services that incorporate new technologies and content, it may be required to license additional technology or content. Tripadvisor cannot be sure that such technology or content will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.\nTripadvisor\u2019s processing, storage and use of personal information and other data subjects it to additional laws and regulations and failure to comply with those laws and regulations could give rise to liabilities.\nTripadvisor collects, processes, stores and transmits data, including personal information, for its consumers and its workforce. As a result, Tripadvisor is subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information, the scope of which is changing; and subject to differing interpretations, and which may be inconsistent between countries or conflict with other existing laws. In addition, the security of data when engaging in electronic commerce is essential to maintaining consumer and travel service provider confidence in its services. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is currently in flux and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Practices regarding the collection, use, storage, transmission and security of personal information by companies operating over the Internet have recently come under increased public scrutiny. The U.S. Congress and federal agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Commerce, are reviewing the need for greater regulation for the collection and use of information concerning consumer\nI-26\nbehavior on the Internet in the United States. Various U.S. courts also are considering the applicability of existing federal and state statutes, including computer trespass and wiretapping laws, to the collection and exchange of information online.\nIn addition, Tripadvisor is subject to legislation intended to enhance the privacy and security of personal data, including credit card information (such as the GDPR and the CCPA and other country specific data protection laws). There are a number of proposals for data privacy laws pending or proposed in other jurisdictions, including at both the federal and state level of the United States, as well as internationally. Implementing and complying with these laws and regulations may be more costly or take longer than Tripadvisor anticipates, or could otherwise affect its business operations. Tripadvisor strives to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection. Any failure or perceived failure by Tripadvisor to comply with its privacy policies, privacy-related obligations to consumers or other third parties, or privacy-related legal obligations, may result in governmental enforcement actions, including, for example, fines and/or penalties, compliance orders, litigation or public statements that could harm Tripadvisor\u2019s reputation and cause its users and travel partners to lose trust in it, any of which could have an adverse effect on Tripadvisor\u2019s business, brand, market share and results of operations.\nTripadvisor is subject to risks associated with processing credit card and other payment transactions and failure to manage those risks may subject it to fines, penalties and additional costs and could have a negative impact on its business.\nTripadvisor accepts payments from consumers and travel partners using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, direct debit from a customer\u2019s bank account, and invoicing. For existing and future payment options Tripadvisor offers to its customers, Tripadvisor may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes). These regulations and/or requirements could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of its payment products, and yet may still be susceptible to fraudulent activity. In addition, Tripadvisor may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards on its websites as well as other payment disputes with its customers. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, Tripadvisor pays interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise its operating costs and lower profitability. Tripadvisor relies on third parties to provide certain payment methods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards and debit cards. In each case, Tripadvisor\u2019s business could be disrupted, if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to Tripadvisor. Tripadvisor is also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for Tripadvisor to comply. If Tripadvisor fails to comply with these rules or requirements, or if its data security systems are breached or compromised, it may be liable for card issuing banks\u2019 costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and/or lose its ability to accept credit and debit card payments, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments.\nTripadvisor is also subject to a number of other laws and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international money transfers, privacy and information security, and electronic fund transfers. If Tripadvisor is found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, it could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services.\nSystem security issues, data protection breaches, cyberattacks and system outage issues could disrupt Tripadvisor\u2019s operations or services provided to its consumers, and any such disruption could damage its reputation and adversely affect its business, financial results and stock price.\nTripadvisor\u2019s reputation and ability to attract, retain and service its consumers and travel partners is dependent upon the reliable performance and security of its computer systems, workforce and those of third parties it utilizes in its operations. Significant security issues, data breaches, cyberattacks and outages, interruptions or delays, in Tripadvisor\u2019s systems or third party systems upon which it relies, could impair Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to display content or process transactions and significantly harm its business. Breaches of Tripadvisor\u2019s security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about Tripadvisor, its consumers or its travel partners could expose Tripadvisor, its consumers and its travel partners to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, damage Tripadvisor\u2019s brand and reputation or otherwise harm its business and financial performance and result in government enforcement actions and litigation and potential liability for Tripadvisor.\nI-27\nComputer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, ransomware and other malicious software programs that attack Tripadvisor\u2019s products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of its products, or attempt to fraudulently induce Tripadvisor\u2019s employees, consumers, or others to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or unwittingly provide access to its systems or data. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that Tripadvisor produces or procures from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. Tripadvisor may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to investigate and address problems caused by cyber or other security problems.\nTripadvisor may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures and its efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede Tripadvisor\u2019s sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions. Failure to adequately protect against attacks or intrusions, whether for its own systems or systems of vendors, could expose Tripadvisor to security breaches that could have an adverse impact on Tripadvisor\u2019s financial performance. The costs of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved stability and redundancy may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain. In addition, to the extent that Tripadvisor experiences a data breach, remediation may be costly and Tripadvisor may not have adequate insurance to cover such costs.\nMuch of Tripadvisor\u2019s business is conducted with third party partners and vendors, for example, marketing agencies and SaaS providers. A security breach at such third party could be perceived by consumers as a security breach of Tripadvisor\u2019s systems and could result in negative publicity or damage its reputation, expose it to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject Tripadvisor to regulatory penalties and sanctions. In addition, such incidents may also result in a decline in Tripadvisor\u2019s active user base or engagement levels. Finally, failure of such third parties to comply with applicable disclosure requirements could expose Tripadvisor to liability.\nTripadvisor has acquired a number of companies over the years and may continue to do so in the future. As a result of these acquisitions, Tripadvisor may increase the volume of personal data that it collects, stores, processes and transmits. While Tripadvisor makes significant efforts to address any information security issues and personal data protection issues with respect to its acquisitions, Tripadvisor may still inherit such risks when it integrates the acquired businesses.\nMedia coverage of data breaches and consumer rights has escalated, in part because of the increased number of enforcement actions, investigations and lawsuits. Security breaches could result in negative publicity, damage to reputation, exposure to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability due to regulatory penalties and sanctions. As this focus and attention on privacy and data protection increases, Tripadvisor also risks exposure to potential liabilities and costs resulting from the compliance with, or any failure to comply with applicable legal requirements, conflicts among these legal requirements or differences in approaches to privacy and security. Security breaches could also cause travelers and potential consumers to lose confidence in Tripadvisor\u2019s security, which would have a negative effect on the value of its brand.\nEvolving guidance on use of \u201ccookies\u201d and similar technology could negatively impact the way Tripadvisor does business.\nA \"cookie\" is a text file that is stored on a user's web browser by a website. Cookies are common tools used by thousands of websites, including Tripadvisor\u2019s, to, among other things, store or gather information (e.g., remember log-on details so a user does not have to re-enter them when revisiting a website), market to consumers, improve site security and enhance the user experience on a website. Cookies and similar tracking technologies are valuable tools for websites and apps like Tripadvisor\u2019s to improve the customer experience and increase conversion on their websites. Many countries have adopted data protection laws that introduce regulations governing the use of \"cookies and other similar tracking technologies\u201d by websites and app developers servicing consumers. To the extent any such regulations require \"opt-in\" or \u201caffirmative\u201d consent before certain cookies or trackers can be placed on a user's device, or the ability of users to \u201copt-out\u201d or control their preferences, Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to serve certain customers in the manner it currently does, including with respect to retargeting or personalized advertising, might be adversely affected and its ability to continue to improve\nI-28\nand optimize performance on Tripadvisor\u2019s websites might be impaired, either of which could negatively affect a consumer's experience using its services and its business, market share and results of operations.\nTripadvisor may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms.\nTripadvisor is currently party to a credit agreement with respect to a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility maturing in May 2022 ( \u201c2015 Credit Facility\u201d), as more fully discussed in note 7. This agreement includes restrictive covenants that may impact the way Tripadvisor manages its business and may limit its ability to secure significant additional financing in the future on favorable terms. Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to secure additional financing and satisfy its financial obligations outstanding from time to time will depend upon its future operating performance, which is subject to then prevailing general economic and credit market conditions, including interest rate levels and the availability of credit generally, and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond its control. There can be no assurance that sufficient financing will be available or desirable, or even any, terms to fund investments, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends, debt refinancing or extraordinary actions or that counterparties in any such financings would honor their contractual commitments.\nTripadvisor has indebtedness which could adversely affect its business and financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Tripadvisor had no outstanding long-term debt; however, Tripadvisor continues to have existing credit facilities from which it can borrow significant amounts. As such, Tripadvisor is still subject to risks relating to its potential indebtedness that include:\n\u25cf Increasing its vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u25cf Requiring Tripadvisor to dedicate a portion of its cash flow from operations to principal and interest payments on its indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf Making it more difficult for Tripadvisor to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for its businesses;\n\u25cf Limiting Tripadvisor\u2019s flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its businesses and the markets in which it operates;\n\u25cf Possibly placing Tripadvisor at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt;\n\u25cf Limiting Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow funds at rates or on other terms that it finds acceptable; and\n\u25cf Exposing Tripadvisor to the risk of increased interest rates because its outstanding debt is expected to be subject to variable rates of interest.\nIn addition, it is possible that Tripadvisor may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business. The terms of the 2015 Credit Facility allow Tripadvisor to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations; however, there is no assurance that additional financing will be available to Tripadvisor on terms favorable to it, if at all. In addition, if new debt is added to the then existing debt levels, the risks described above could intensify.\nTripadvisor\u2019s 2015 Credit Facility provides for various provisions that limit its discretion in the operation of its business and require Tripadvisor to meet financial maintenance tests and other covenants and the failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on Tripadvisor.\nTripadvisor is party to a credit agreement providing for the 2015 Credit Facility. The agreements that govern the 2015 Credit Facility contain various covenants, including those that limit Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf Incur indebtedness;\n\u25cf Pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase its capital stock;\nI-29\n\u25cf Enter into certain asset sale transactions, including partial or full spin-off transactions;\n\u25cf Enter into secured financing arrangements;\n\u25cf Enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and\n\u25cf Enter into unrelated businesses.\nThese covenants may limit Tripadvisor\u2019s ability to optimally operate its business. In addition, the 2015 Credit Facility requires that Tripadvisor meet certain financial tests, including a leverage ratio test. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the 2015 Credit Facility may result in an event of default under the agreements governing such facility. Such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the debt incurred thereunder. In addition, lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply Tripadvisor with further funds (including periodic rollovers of existing borrowings).\nTripadvisor\u2019s effective income tax rate is impacted by a number of factors that could have a material impact on its financial results and could increase the volatility of those results.\nDue to the global nature of its business, Tripadvisor is subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions. In the event Tripadvisor incurs net income in certain jurisdictions but incurs losses in other jurisdictions, it generally cannot offset the income from one jurisdiction with the loss from another. This lack of flexibility increases Tripadvisor\u2019s effective income tax rate. Furthermore, significant judgment is required to calculate Tripadvisor\u2019s worldwide provision for income taxes and depends on its ability to operate its business in a manner consistent with its corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. In the ordinary course of its business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.\nTripadvisor believes its tax estimates are reasonable. However, Tripadvisor is routinely under audit by federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The taxing authorities of jurisdictions in which Tripadvisor operates may challenge its methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements, including its transfer pricing, or determine that the manner in which it operates its business does not achieve the intended tax consequences, which would increase Tripadvisor\u2019s effective income tax rate and harm its financial position and results of operations. As Tripadvisor operates in numerous taxing jurisdictions, the application of tax laws can also be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by taxing authorities of these jurisdictions. It is not uncommon for taxing authorities of different countries to have conflicting views, for instance, with respect to, among other things, the manner in which the arm\u2019s length standard is applied for transfer pricing purposes, or with respect to the valuation of intellectual property. For example, the OECD has recently recommended changes to numerous long-standing international tax principles. If countries amend their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the OECD guidelines, this may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact Tripadvisor\u2019s tax liabilities. Any of these changes could affect Tripadvisor\u2019s financial performance.\nThe final determination of audits could be materially different from Tripadvisor\u2019s income tax provisions and accruals and could have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. Also, Tripadvisor\u2019s future effective income tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. If Tripadvisor\u2019s effective income tax rates were to increase, its results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nThe income tax effects of the accounting for share-based compensation may significantly impact Tripadvisor\u2019s effective income tax rate. In periods in which Tripadvisor\u2019s stock price is higher than the grant-date price of the share-based compensation awards vesting in that period, it will recognize excess tax benefits that will decrease its income tax rate. In periods in which Tripadvisor\u2019s stock price is lower than the grant-date price of the share-based compensation awards vesting in that period, its effective income tax rate will increase.\nI-30\nApplication of U.S. state and local or international tax laws, changes in tax laws or tax rulings, or the examination of Tripadvisor\u2019s tax positions, could materially affect its financial position and results of operations.\nAs an international business, Tripadvisor is subject to income taxes and non-income-based taxes in the United States and various other international jurisdictions Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. Tripadvisor\u2019s existing corporate structure and intercompany arrangements have been implemented in a manner Tripadvisor believes is in compliance with current prevailing tax laws. However, due to economic and political conditions, tax rates and tax regimes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant changes and the tax benefits that Tripadvisor intends to eventually derive could be undermined due to changing tax laws. Governments are increasingly focused on ways to increase tax revenue, which has contributed to an increase in audit activity, more aggressive positions taken by tax authorities and an increase in tax legislation. Any such additional taxes or other assessments may be in excess of Tripadvisor\u2019s current tax provisions or may require Tripadvisor to modify its business practices in order to reduce its exposure to additional taxes going forward, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Tripadvisor\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Tax Act has resulted in significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system. The tax law changes by the Tax Act are broad and complex and there are still uncertainties about how the Tax Act will be interpreted at both the U.S. federal and state levels. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from Tripadvisor\u2019s interpretation. This could materially change the taxes that Tripadvisor recorded since 2017, and the expected future impact of the Tax Act on its business.\nThe OECD has been working on a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, and issued the Action 1 report in 2015 to address the tax challenges arising from digitalization. Since then, the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework has issued various guidelines, policy notes, and proposals that if adopted could result in an overhaul of the international taxation system under which Tripadvisor\u2019s current tax obligations are determined. As the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework drives toward a consensus long-term solution, several countries have introduced unilateral digital service tax initiatives which impose new types of non-income taxes, including taxes based on a percentage of revenue. In July 2019, France signed into law a 3% digital services tax to be applied retroactively as of January 1, 2019. Tripadvisor recorded an estimate of $3 million for digital service tax to general and administrative expense on its consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31, 2019, however it continues to assess the financial impact of this new law. Tripadvisor is also monitoring other U.S. states and countries in which it does business, such as Italy, Spain, and the U.K., which have enacted or proposed similar taxes that will be applicable or are likely to be applicable during 2020. Tripadvisor will continue to monitor developments and determine the financial impact worldwide of these initiatives.\nAny changes to international tax laws, including new definitions of permanent establishment, could affect the tax treatment of Tripadvisor\u2019s foreign earnings and adversely impact its effective income tax rate. Further, changes to tax laws and additional reporting requirements could increase the complexity, burden and cost of compliance. Due to the large and expanding scale of Tripadvisor\u2019s international business activities, any changes in U.S. or international taxation of its activities or the combined effect of tax laws in multiple jurisdictions may increase Tripadvisor\u2019s worldwide effective income tax rate, increase the complexity and costs associated with tax compliance (especially if changes are implemented or interpreted inconsistently across tax jurisdictions) and adversely affect its cash flows and results of operations.\nIn addition, the taxing authorities in the United States and other jurisdictions where Tripadvisor does business regularly examine its income and other tax returns as well as the tax returns of Expedia, Tripadvisor\u2019s former parent. The ultimate outcome of these examinations (including the IRS audit described below) cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the IRS or other taxing authorities assess additional taxes as a result of examinations, Tripadvisor may be required to record charges to its operations, which could harm its operating results and financial condition.\nChanges in the tax treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce may adversely affect the commercial use of Tripadvisor\u2019s sites and its financial results.\nDue to the global nature of the internet, it is possible that various states or foreign countries might attempt to levy additional or new sales, income or other taxes relating to Tripadvisor\u2019s activities. Tax authorities at the international,\nI-31\nfederal, state and local levels are currently reviewing the appropriate treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce. For example, Congress is considering various approaches to legislation that would require companies engaged in e-commerce to collect sales tax on Internet revenue and a growing number of U.S. states and certain foreign jurisdictions have adopted or are considering proposals to impose obligations on remote sellers and online marketplaces to collect taxes on their behalf. Additionally, the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., which a Court reversed longstanding precedent that remote sellers are not required to collect state and local sales taxes, may have an adverse impact on Tripadvisor\u2019s business. Also, as described in more detail above, the European Commission released two draft directives on the Taxation of the Digital Economy and, on July 24, 2019, President Macron signed into law the French Digital Services Tax. New or revised international, federal, state or local tax regulations or court decisions may subject Tripadvisor or its customers to additional sales, occupancy, income and other taxes. Tripadvisor cannot predict the effect of these and other attempts to impose sales, income or other taxes on e-commerce. New or revised taxes and, in particular, sales taxes, occupancy taxes, value added taxes (\u201cVAT\u201d) and similar taxes would likely increase the cost of doing business online and decrease the attractiveness of selling products and services over the Internet. New taxes could also create significant increases in internal costs necessary to capture data and collect and remit taxes. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Tripadvisor\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that Tripadvisor should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, occupancy, VAT or similar taxes, and Tripadvisor could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect its operating results.\nTripadvisor does not collect and remit sales and use, occupancy, VAT or similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which it has sales, based on its belief that such taxes are not applicable or legally required. Several states and other taxing jurisdictions have presented or threatened Tripadvisor with assessments, alleging that Tripadvisor is required to collect and remit certain taxes there. While Tripadvisor does not believe that it is subject to such taxes and intends to vigorously defend its position in these cases, it cannot be sure of the outcome of its discussions and/or appeals with these states or cases that are pending in the courts. In the event of an adverse outcome, Tripadvisor could face assessments for additional time periods since the last assessments it received, plus any additional interest and penalties. Tripadvisor also expects additional jurisdictions may make similar assessments or pass similar new laws in the future, and any of the jurisdictions where Tripadvisor has sales may apply more rigorous enforcement efforts or take more aggressive positions in the future that could result in greater tax liability allegations. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest or future requirements may materially adversely affect Tripadvisor\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nTripadvisor continues to be subject to significant potential tax liabilities in connection with its spin-off from Expedia (the \u201cSpin-Off\u201d).\nUnder the tax sharing agreement between Tripadvisor and Expedia entered into in connection with the Spin-Off, Tripadvisor is generally required to indemnify Expedia for any taxes resulting from the Spin-Off (and any related interest, penalties, legal and professional fees, and all costs and damages associated with related stockholder litigation or controversies) to the extent such amounts resulted from (i) any act or failure to act by Tripadvisor described in the covenants in the tax sharing agreement, (ii) any acquisition of Tripadvisor\u2019s equity securities or assets or those of a member of its group, or (iii) any failure of the representations with respect to Tripadvisor or any member of its group to be true or any breach by Tripadvisor or any member of its group of any covenant, in each case, which is contained in the separation documents or in the documents relating to the IRS private letter ruling and/or the opinion of counsel.\nTripadvisor continues to be responsible for potential tax liabilities in connection with consolidated income tax returns filed with Expedia prior to or in connection with the Spin-Off. By virtue of previously filed consolidated tax returns with Expedia, Tripadvisor is currently under IRS audit for the 2009, 2010, and 2011 tax years. In connection with that audit, Tripadvisor received, in January 2017 and April 2019, Notices of Proposed Adjustment from the IRS for the 2009, 2010 and 2011 tax years, which would result in an increase in Tripadvisor\u2019s worldwide income tax expense. The proposed adjustments would result in a reimbursement to Expedia in an estimated range totaling $15 million to $20 million for those specific years related to the pre spin-off years after consideration of competent authority relief, exclusive of interest and penalties. The outcome of these matters or any other audits could subject Tripadvisor to significant tax liabilities.\nI-32\nTripadvisor is subject to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange risk.\nTripadvisor conducts a significant and growing portion of its business outside the United States, but reports its results in U.S. dollars. As a result, Tripadvisor faces exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly those related to the Euro, British pound and Australian dollar. These exposures include, but are not limited to re-measurement of gains and losses from changes in the value of foreign denominated assets and liabilities; translation gains and losses on foreign subsidiary financial results that are translated into U.S. dollars upon consolidation; and planning risk related to changes in exchange rates between the time Tripadvisor prepares its annual and quarterly forecasts and when actual results occur. For example, Brexit caused significant volatility in currency exchange rates, especially between the U.S. dollar and the British pound. Continued uncertainty regarding the final terms of Brexit may result in future exchange rate volatility. In addition, in the event that one or more European countries were to replace the Euro with another currency, Tripadvisor\u2019s sales into such countries, or into Europe generally, would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, such as the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro or the British pound, could adversely affect Tripadvisor\u2019s net revenue growth in future periods.\nDepending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates, if Tripadvisor were to choose not to hedge or were to fail to hedge effectively its exposure, Tripadvisor could experience a material adverse effect on its financial statements and financial condition. As seen in some recent periods, in the event of severe volatility in exchange rates, the impact of these exposures can increase, and the impact on results of operations can be more pronounced. In addition, the current environment and the increasingly global nature of Tripadvisor\u2019s business have made hedging these exposures more complex. Tripadvisor hedges certain short-term foreign currency exposures with the purchase of forward exchange contracts. These forward exchange contracts only help mitigate the impact of changes in foreign currency rates that occur during the term of the related contract period and carry risks of counter-party failure. There can be no assurance that its forward exchange contracts will have their intended effects.\nSignificant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect consumer travel behavior. Volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and its impact on consumer behavior, which may differ across regions, makes it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trends and the timing and degree of their impact on Tripadvisor\u2019s markets and business, which in turn could adversely affect its ability to effectively manage its business and adversely affect its results of operations.\nFuture sales of shares of Tripadvisor\u2019s or our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, may depress its or our stock price.\nSales of substantial amounts of Tripadvisor\u2019s common stock in the public market, particularly sales by its directors, officers, employees and significant stockholders, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of its common stock and hence our common stock and could impact our respective abilities to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. For example, sales of or hedging transactions, such as collars, in our shares by any of our directors or executive officers could cause a perception in the marketplace that our stock price (and hence Tripadvisor's stock price) has peaked or that adverse events or trends have occurred or may be occurring at our company or Tripadvisor. This perception could result notwithstanding any personal financial motivation for these insider transactions. In addition, we have the right to require Tripadvisor to file registration statements covering Tripadvisor shares we own or to include Tripadvisor shares in registration statements that it may file for itself or other stockholders. If we or some other Tripadvisor stockholder sells substantial amounts of Tripadvisor\u2019s common stock in the public market, or if there is a perception in the public market that we might sell shares of Tripadvisor common stock, the market price of Tripadvisor\u2019s common stock could decrease significantly. A decline in the price of shares of Tripadvisor\u2019s common stock or our common stock might impede its or our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of common stock or other equity securities.\nI-33\nFactors Relating to our Common Stock and the Securities Market\nOur stock price may be disproportionately affected by the results of operations of Tripadvisor and developments in its business.\nThe fair value of our investment in Tripadvisor, on an as-converted basis, was approximately $941 million as of December 31, 2019, which represents a significant portion of our total market value. Since the TripCo Spin-Off in 2014, our share price has had a tendency to move in tandem with the share price of Tripadvisor's common stock. As a result, our stock price may be disproportionately affected by the results of operations of Tripadvisor and developments in its business.\nIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company that a stockholder may consider favorable. These provisions include the following:\n\u25cf authorizing a capital structure with multiple series of common stock: a Series B that entitles the holders to ten votes per share, a Series A that entitles the holders to one vote per share and a Series C that, except as otherwise required by applicable law, entitles the holders to no voting rights;\n\u25cf authorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u25cf classifying our board of directors with staggered three-year terms, which may lengthen the time required to gain control of our board of directors;\n\u25cf limiting who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u25cf prohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n\u25cf establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf requiring stockholder approval by holders of at least 66 2/3% of our voting power or the approval by at least 75% of our board of directors with respect to certain extraordinary matters, such as a merger or consolidation of our company, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or an amendment to our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u25cf the existence of authorized and unissued stock which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of its management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us.\nIn addition, Gregory B. Maffei, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owns shares representing the power to direct approximately 39% of the aggregate voting power in our company, due to his beneficial ownership of approximately 97% of the outstanding shares of our Series B common stock as of January 31, 2020.\nHolders of a single series of our common stock may not have any remedies if an action by our directors has an adverse effect on only that series of our common stock.\nPrinciples of Delaware law and the provisions of our certificate of incorporation may protect decisions of our board of directors that have a disparate impact upon holders of any single series of our common stock. Under Delaware law, the board of directors has a duty to act with due care and in the best interests of all of our stockholders, including the holders of all series of our common stock. Principles of Delaware law established in cases involving differing treatment of multiple classes or series of stock provide that a board of directors owes an equal duty to all common stockholders regardless of class or series and does not have separate or additional duties to any group of stockholders. As a result, in some circumstances, our directors may be required to make a decision that is viewed as adverse to the holders of one series of our common stock. Under the principles of Delaware law and the business judgment rule, holders may not be able to\nI-34\nsuccessfully challenge decisions that they believe have a disparate impact upon the holders of one series of our stock if our board of directors is disinterested and independent with respect to the action taken, is adequately informed with respect to the action taken and acts in good faith and in the honest belief that the board is acting in the best interest of all of our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 14873, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "LTRPA"}
