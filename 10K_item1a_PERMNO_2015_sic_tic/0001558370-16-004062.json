{"cik": "1051627", "company": "AXT INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nFor ease of reference, we have divided these risks and uncertainties into the following general categories:\nI.\nRisks related to our general business;\nII.\nRisks related to international aspects of our business;\nIII.\nRisks related to our financial results and capital structure;\nIV.\nRisks related to our intellectual property; and\nV.\nRisks related to compliance, environmental regulations and other legal matters.\nI.\nRisks Related to Our General Business\nSilicon substrates (wafers) are significantly lower in cost compared to substrates made from specialty materials and new silicon-based technologies could allow silicon based substrates to replace specialty material based substrates for certain applications.\nHistorically silicon wafers or substrates are less expensive than specialty material substrates such as those that we produce. Electronic circuit designers will generally consider silicon first and only turn to alternative materials if silicon cannot provide the required functionality in terms of power consumption, speed or other specifications. Beginning in 2011 certain applications that had previously used GaAs substrates adopted a new silicon-based technology called Silicon On Insulator, or SOI. SOI technology uses a silicon-insulator-silicon layered substrate in place of conventional silicon substrates in semiconductor manufacturing. SOI substrates cost less than GaAs substrates and although their performance is not as robust as GaAs substrates in terms of power consumption, heat generation and speed they became acceptable in mobile phone and other applications that were previously dominated by GaAs\nsubstrates. The adoption of SOI resulted in decreased GaAs wafer demand, and decreased revenue. If SOI or similar technologies gain more widespread market acceptance, or are used in more applications, our business and operating results could be significantly and adversely affected.\nUnderutilizing our manufacturing facilities may result in declines in our gross margins.\nAn important factor in our success is the extent to which we are able to utilize the available capacity in our manufacturing facilities. A number of factors and circumstances may reduce utilization rates, including periods of industry overcapacity, low levels of customer orders, operating inefficiencies, mechanical failures and disruption of operations due to expansion, power interruptions, fire, flood or other natural disasters or calamities. Because many portions of our manufacturing costs are relatively fixed, high utilization rates are critical to our gross margins and operating results. If we fail to achieve acceptable manufacturing volumes or experience product shipment delays, our results of operations will be negatively affected. During periods of decreased demand, we have underutilized our manufacturing lines. If we are unable to improve utilization levels at our facilities during periods of decreased demand and correctly manage capacity, the fixed expense levels will have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our gross profit margins have fluctuated from period to period, and these fluctuations are expected to continue in the future. Our gross profit margin has fluctuated from 23.7% in the quarter ended March 31, 2015 to 17.1% for the quarter ended December 31, 2015.\nIn 2013, we concluded that incoming orders were insufficient and that we were significantly underutilizing our factory capacity. As a result, in February 2014, we announced a restructuring plan with respect to our wholly-owned subsidiary, Beijing Tongmei Xtal Technology Co, Ltd., or Tongmei, in order to better align manufacturing capacity with demand. Under the restructuring plan, we posted a charge of approximately $907,000 in the first quarter of 2014.\nIf we receive fewer customer orders than forecasted or if our customers delay or cancel orders, we may not be able to reduce our manufacturing costs in the short-term and our gross margins would be negatively affected. In addition, lead times required by our customers are shrinking which reduces our ability to forecast orders and properly balance our capacity utilization.\nOur gross margin has fluctuated historically and may decline due to several factors.\nOur gross profit margin has fluctuated from period to period as a result of shifts in product mix, the introduction of new products, decreases in average selling prices for products, utilization of our manufacturing capacity and our ability to reduce product costs. These fluctuations are expected to continue in the future.\nWe do not control the prices at which our subsidiaries and other joint venture companies sell their raw materials products to third parties. However, because we consolidate the results of three of these companies with our own, any reduction in their gross margins could have a significant, adverse impact on our overall gross margins. One or more of our companies has in the past, and may in the future, sell raw materials at significantly reduced prices in order to gain volume sales or sales to new customers. In addition, in the three months ended December 31, 2015, the market price of gallium dropped below our per unit inventory cost and we incurred an inventory write down under the lower of cost or market accounting rules. In such events, our gross margin may be adversely impacted. In addition, one of our consolidated subsidiaries has in the past been subject to capacity constraints requiring it to source product from other third party suppliers in order to meet customer demand, resulting in decreased gross margin and adversely impacting our gross margin. This joint venture may in the future continue to experience such capacity restraints, causing our gross margin, and consequently our operating results, to be adversely impacted.\nIntense competition in the markets for our products could prevent us from increasing revenue and sustaining profitability.\nThe markets for our products are intensely competitive. We face competition for our substrate products from other manufacturers of substrates, such as Freiberger Compound Materials, JX, Umicore, Sumitomo Electric Industries and CCTC, from semiconductor device manufacturers that produce substrates for their own use, and from companies, such as TriQuint Semiconductors, RFMD and Skyworks that are actively developing alternative materials to GaAs and\nmarketing semiconductor devices using these alternative materials. We believe that at least two of our major competitors are shipping high volumes of GaAs substrates manufactured using a technique similar to our VGF technology. Other competitors may develop and begin using similar technology. Sumitomo and JX also compete with us in the InP market. If we are unable to compete effectively, our revenue may not increase and we may not achieve profitability. We face many competitors that have a number of significant advantages over us, including:\n\u00b7\ngreater name recognition and market share in the business;\n\u00b7\nmore manufacturing experience;\n\u00b7\nextensive intellectual property; and\n\u00b7\nsignificantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources.\nOur competitors could develop new or enhanced products that are more effective than our products.\nThe level and intensity of competition has increased over the past years and we expect competition to continue to increase in the future. Competitive pressures have resulted in reductions in the prices of our products, and continued or increased competition could reduce our market share, require us to further reduce the prices of our products, affect our ability to recover costs and result in reduced gross margins.\nIn addition, new competitors have and may continue to emerge, such as a crystal growing company established by a former employee in China that is supplying semi-conducting GaAs wafers to the LED market. Competition from sources such as this could increase, particularly if these competitors are able to obtain large capital investments.\nIf we have low product yields, the shipment of our products may be delayed and our product cost and operating results may be adversely impacted.\nA critical factor in our product cost is yield. Our products are manufactured using complex technologies, and the number of usable substrates we produce can fluctuate as a result of many factors, including:\n\u00b7\nimpurities in the materials used;\n\u00b7\ncontamination of the manufacturing environment;\n\u00b7\nquality control and inconsistency in quality levels;\n\u00b7\nlack of automation and inconsistent processing requiring manual manufacturing steps;\n\u00b7\nsubstrate breakage during the manufacturing process; and\n\u00b7\nequipment failure, power outages or variations in the manufacturing process.\nIn addition, we may modify our process to meet a customer specification but this can impact our yield. If our yields decrease, our revenue could decline if we are unable to produce product to our customers\u2019 requirements. At the same time, our manufacturing costs could remain fixed, or could increase. We have experienced product shipment delays and difficulties in achieving acceptable yields on both new and older products, and delays and poor yields have adversely affected our operating results. We may experience similar problems in the future and we cannot predict when they may occur or their duration or severity.\nIf our manufacturing processes result in defects in our products making them unfit for use by our customers, our products would be rejected, resulting in compensation costs paid to our customers, and possible disqualification. This could lead to revenue loss and market share loss.\nThe Chinese government has imposed, and may impose in the future, manufacturing restrictions and regulations that could require us to move part of our manufacturing operations to a location outside of the Beijing area or temporarily cease or limit manufacturing. Such restrictions would materially and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition.\nThe Beijing city government has announced that it will expand its offices into the area where our facility is located. The Beijing city government desires to upgrade this area and has begun to pressure some companies to relocate and, in some instances, is providing financial incentives for such relocation. If, in the future, we relocate all or part of our operations, this would require us to form an orderly relocation plan to do so and our failure to properly execute such a plan could result in disruptions to our production and have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Further, the cost of a new facility could be prohibitive.\nThe Chinese government has in the past imposed temporary restrictions on manufacturing facilities, such as the restrictions imposed on polluting factories for the 2008 Olympics and the 2014 Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (\u201cAPEC\u201d) event. These restrictions included a shut-down of the transportation of materials and power plants to reduce air pollution. To reduce air pollution in Beijing, the Chinese government has sometimes limited the construction of new, or expansion of existing, facilities by manufacturing companies in the Beijing area. If the government applied similar restrictions to us, then such restrictions could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and our financial condition. Our ability to supply current or new orders could be significantly impacted. Customers could then be required to purchase products from our competitors, causing our competitors to take market share from us.\nIn addition, from time to time, the Chinese government issues new regulations, which may require additional actions on our part to comply. On February 27, 2015, the China State Administration of Work Safety updated its list of hazardous substances. The previous list, which was published in 2002, did not restrict the materials that we use in our wafers. The new list added gallium arsenide. As a result of the newly published list, we were required to obtain a permit by May 1, 2015 to continue to manufacture our gallium arsenide substrate wafers. We initiated discussions with the local district agency to obtain the requisite permit. On May 4, 2015, we were instructed by the local district agency that because we had not yet received the requisite permit, we should cease manufacturing our gallium arsenide substrate wafers or we should obtain permission to continue manufacturing our gallium arsenide substrate wafers from a municipal-level office, such as the Beijing municipal authority. The Beijing municipal authority accepted our application on May 7, 2015 and our application is still under review. There can be no assurances that we will receive the requisite permit from the Beijing municipal authority or from any other Chinese governmental authority. If we do not receive the requisite permit to continue to manufacture gallium arsenide substrate wafers, we may be required to cease manufacturing such wafers until we receive the requisite permit or move such manufacturing to a new location. A halt to our production of gallium arsenide substrate wafers could result in our furloughing approximately several hundred manufacturing employees. If we obtain the requisite permit after halting our production, we might not be able to recommence manufacturing gallium arsenide substrate wafers immediately because we may need to rebuild our supply chain and we may not be able to rehire our furloughed manufacturing employees. We could also lose customers to our competitors because of our inability to supply gallium arsenide substrate wafers. Any of these could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition.\nProblems incurred in our 10 partially owned joint venture companies or investment partners could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have invested in subsidiaries and joint venture companies in China that produce materials including 99.99% pure gallium (4N Ga), high purity gallium (7N Ga), arsenic, germanium, germanium dioxide, pyrolytic boron nitride (pBN) crucibles and boron oxide (B2O3). We purchase a portion of the materials produced by these companies for our use and they sell the remainder of their production to third parties. Our ownership and the ownership held by our consolidated subsidiaries in these entities ranges from 20% to 83%. We consolidate the companies in which we have a majority or controlling financial interest and employ equity accounting for the companies in which we have a smaller ownership interest. Several of companies occupy space within larger facilities owned and/or operated by one of the other venture partners. Several of these venture partners are engaged in other manufacturing activities at or near the same facility. In some facilities, we share access to certain functions, including water, hazardous waste treatment or air quality treatment. If any of our joint venture partners in any of these ventures experiences problems with its operations,\ndisruptions of our joint venture operations could result, having a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operation of our joint venture companies, and correspondingly on our financial condition or results of operations. For example, since gallium is a by-product of aluminum, our raw gallium joint venture in China, which is housed in and receives services from an affiliated aluminum plant, could generate lower production of gallium as a result of reduced services provided by the aluminum plant. Accordingly, in order to meet customer supply obligations, our joint venture may have to source materials from another independent third party supplier, resulting in reduced gross margin.\nIn addition, if any of our joint ventures or venture partners with which our joint ventures share facilities is deemed to have violated applicable laws, rules or regulations governing the use, storage, discharge or disposal of hazardous chemicals during manufacturing, research and development or sales demonstrations, the operations of our joint ventures could be adversely affected and we could be subject to substantial liability for clean-up efforts, personal injury and fines or suspension or cessation of our joint venture operations as a result of the actions of the joint ventures or other venture partners. Employees working for our joint ventures or any of the other venture partners could bring litigation against us as a result of actions taken at the joint venture or venture partner facilities, even though we are not directly controlling the operations, including actions for exposure to chemicals or other hazardous materials at the facilities of our joint ventures or the facilities of any venture partner that are shared by our joint ventures. While we would expect to defend ourselves vigorously in any litigation that is brought against us, litigation is inherently uncertain and it is possible that our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be affected. Even if we are not deemed responsible for the actions of the joint ventures or venture partners, litigation could be costly, time consuming to defend and divert management attention; in addition, if we are deemed to be the most financially viable of the partners, plaintiffs may decide to pursue us for damages.\nSince all of our partially owned companies reside in China, their activities could subject us to a number of risks associated with conducting operations internationally, including:\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in managing geographically disparate operations;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in enforcing agreements through non-U.S. legal systems;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements that may limit our ability to manufacture, export the products of our joint venture companies or sell into particular jurisdictions or impose multiple conflicting tax laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic instability, civil unrest or war;\n\u00b7\nterrorist activities that impact international commerce;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws and practices do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws and practices of the United States;\n\u00b7\nchanging laws and policies affecting economic liberalization, foreign investment, currency convertibility or exchange rates, taxation or employment; and\n\u00b7\nnationalization of foreign-owned assets, including intellectual property.\nOur revenue, gross margins and profitability can be hurt if the average sales price of the various raw materials in our partially owned companies decreases.\nAlthough the companies in our vertically integrated supply chain have historically made a positive contribution to our financial performance, the average selling prices for many of the raw materials produced have continued to decline and have had a negative impact on our recent financial performance. In particular, the selling prices for 4N gallium and for germanium have been driven down by oversupply and, in the second half of 2015, hurt our total revenue, reduced our gross margin and contributed to our net loss. There can be no assurance that the oversupply will be corrected by the market. Further, in Q4 2015 one of our consolidated subsidiaries incurred a lower of cost or market inventory write down which negatively impacted our consolidated gross margin. If the pricing environment remains stressed by oversupply and our joint venture companies cannot reduce their production cost, then the reduced average selling prices of the raw materials produced by our joint venture companies will have a continuing adverse impact on our revenue, gross margins and net profit.\nDemand for our products may decrease if demand for the end-user applications decrease or if manufacturers downstream in our supply chain experience difficulty manufacturing, marketing or selling their products.\nOur products are used as components in electronic products. Accordingly, demand for our products is subject to the demand for end-user applications which utilize our products, as well as factors affecting the ability of the manufacturers downstream in our supply chain to introduce and market their products successfully, including:\n\u00b7\nthe competition such manufacturers face in their particular industries;\n\u00b7\nthe technical, manufacturing, sales, marketing and management capabilities of such manufacturers;\n\u00b7\nthe financial and other resources of such manufacturers; and\n\u00b7\nthe inability of such manufacturers to sell their products if they infringe third-party intellectual property rights.\nIf demand for the end-user applications for which our products are used decreases, or if manufacturers downstream in our supply chain are unable to develop, market and sell their products, demand for our products will decrease.\nThe average selling prices of our products may decline over relatively short periods, which may reduce our gross margins.\nThe market for our products is characterized by declining average selling prices resulting from factors such as increased competition, overcapacity, the introduction of new products and decreased sales of products incorporating our products and as a result average selling prices for our products may decline over relatively short time periods. We have in the past experienced, and in the future may experience, substantial period-to-period fluctuations in operating results due to declining average selling prices. For example, on average, for the year ended December 31, 2015 we experienced average selling price declines of approximately 5% to 15% depending on the substrates product. It is possible that the pace of average selling price declines could accelerate beyond these levels for certain products in a commoditizing market. We anticipate that average selling prices will decrease in the future in response to the unstable demand environment, product introductions by competitors or us, or by other factors, including pricing pressures from significant customers. When our average selling prices decline, our gross profits decline unless we are able to sell more products or reduce the cost to manufacture our products. We generally attempt to combat average selling price declines by improving yields, manufacturing efficiency and working to reduce the costs of our raw materials and of manufacturing our products. We have in the past and may in the future experience declining sales prices, which could negatively impact our revenues, gross profits and financial results. We therefore need to sell our current products in increasing volumes to offset any decline in their average selling prices, and introduce new products, which we may not be able to do, or do on a timely basis.\nWe may be unable to reduce the cost of our products sufficiently to enable us to compete with others. Our cost reduction efforts may not allow us to keep pace with competitive pricing pressures and could adversely affect our margins. In order to remain competitive, we must continually reduce the cost of manufacturing our products through design and engineering changes. We cannot assure you that any changes effected by us will result in sufficient cost reductions to allow us to reduce the price of our products to remain competitive or improve our gross margins.\nDefects in our products could diminish demand for our products.\nOur products are complex and may contain defects, including defects resulting from impurities inherent in our raw materials or inconsistencies in our manufacturing processes. We have experienced quality control problems with some of our products, which caused customers to return products to us, reduce orders for our products, or both. We believe that we continue to experience certain reduction in orders as a result of product quality issues. If we experience quality control problems, or experience these or other problems in new products, customers may cancel or reduce orders or purchase products from our competitors and we may be unable to maintain or increase sales to our customers and sales of our products could decline. Defects in our products could cause us to incur higher manufacturing costs and suffer product returns and additional service expenses, all of which could adversely impact our operating results.\nIf new products developed by us contain defects when released, our customers may be dissatisfied and we may suffer negative publicity or customer claims against us, lose sales or experience delays in market acceptance of our new products.\nThe loss of one or more of our key substrate customers would significantly hurt our operating results.\nAlthough there was only one customer that represented more than 10% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, we believe that a significant portion of our future revenue could to be derived from a limited number of substrate customers. Most of our customers are not obligated to purchase a specified quantity of our products or to provide us with binding forecasts of product purchases. In addition, our customers may reduce, delay or cancel orders at any time without any significant penalty. In the past, we have experienced slower bookings, significant push-outs and cancellation of orders from customers. If we lose a major customer or if a customer cancels, reduces or delays orders, or reduces the prices paid for our products, our revenue would decline. In addition, customers that have accounted for significant revenue in the past may not continue to generate revenue for us in any future period. Any delay in scheduled shipments of our products could cause revenue to fall below our expectations and the expectations of market analysts or investors, causing our stock price to decline.\nThe cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may limit our ability to maintain or increase net sales and operating results during industry downturns.\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and periodically experiences significant economic downturns characterized by diminished product demand, resulting in production overcapacity and excess inventory in the markets we serve. A downturn can result in lower unit volumes and rapid erosion of average selling prices. The semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns, often in connection with, or in anticipation of, maturing product cycles of both semiconductor companies\u2019 and their customers\u2019 products or a decline in general economic conditions. This may adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our business.\nOur continuing business depends in significant part upon manufacturers of electronic and opto-electronic compound semiconductor devices, as well as the current and anticipated market demand for these devices and products using these devices. As a supplier to the compound semiconductor industry, we are subject to the business cycles that characterize the industry. The timing, length and volatility of these cycles are difficult to predict. The compound semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical due to sudden changes in demand, the amount of manufacturing capacity and changes in the technology employed in compound semiconductors. The rate of changes in demand, including end demand, is high, and the effect of these changes upon us occurs quickly, exacerbating the volatility of these cycles. These changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers\u2019 purchases and investments in new technology. These industry cycles create pressure on our revenue, gross margin and net income.\nOur industry has in the past experienced periods of oversupply and that has resulted in significantly reduced prices for compound semiconductor devices and components, including our products, both as a result of general economic changes and overcapacity. When this occurs our operating results and financial condition are adversely affected. Oversupply causes greater price competition and can cause our revenue, gross margins and net income to decline. During periods of weak demand, customers typically reduce purchases, delay delivery of products and/or cancel orders of component parts such as our products. Further order cancellations, reductions in order size or delays in orders could occur and would materially adversely affect our business and results of operations. Actions to reduce our costs may be insufficient to align our structure with prevailing business conditions. We may be required to undertake additional cost-cutting measures, and may be unable to invest in marketing, research and development and engineering at the levels we believe are necessary to maintain our competitive position. Our failure to make these investments could seriously harm our business.\nWe base our planned operating expenses in part on our expectations of future revenue, and a significant portion of our expense is relatively fixed. If revenue for a particular quarter is lower than we expect, we likely will be unable to proportionately reduce our operating expenses for that quarter, which would harm our operating results. For example, in 2013, we experienced significantly declining gross margins due to the allocation of fixed costs across a lower volume of sales than anticipated.\nWe purchase critical raw materials and parts for our equipment from single or limited sources, and could lose sales if these sources fail to fill our needs.\nWe depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components and equipment used in manufacturing our products, including key materials such as quartz tubing from our vendor, Kaide, and polishing solutions. Although several of these raw materials are purchased from suppliers in which we hold an ownership interest, we generally purchase these materials through standard purchase orders and not pursuant to long-term supply contracts, and no supplier guarantees supply of raw materials or equipment to us. If we lose any of our key suppliers, our manufacturing efforts could be significantly hampered and we could be prevented from timely producing and delivering products to our customers. Prior to investing in our subsidiaries and joint ventures, we sometimes experienced delays obtaining critical raw materials and spare parts, including gallium, due to shortages of these materials and we could experience such delays again in the future due to shortages of materials and may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of materials. These shortages and delays could result in higher materials costs and cause us to delay or reduce production of our products. If we have to delay or reduce production, we could fail to meet customer delivery schedules and our revenue and operating results could suffer.\nIf we do not successfully develop new products to respond to rapidly changing customer requirements, our ability to generate revenue, obtain new customers, and retain existing customers may suffer.\nOur success depends on our ability to offer new products, including larger diameter substrates, and product features that incorporate leading technology and respond to technological advances. In addition, our new products must meet customer needs and compete effectively on quality, price and performance. The life cycles of our products are difficult to predict. The markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change, changing customer needs and evolving industry standards. If our competitors introduce products employing new technologies or performance characteristics, our existing products could become obsolete and unmarketable. During the past few years, we have seen our competitors selling more substrates manufactured using a crystal growth technology similar to ours, which has eroded our technological differentiation.\nThe development of new products can be a highly complex process, and we may experience delays in developing and introducing new products. Any significant delay could cause us to fail to timely introduce and gain market acceptance of new products. Further, the costs involved in researching, developing and engineering new products could be greater than anticipated. If we fail to offer new products or product enhancements or fail to achieve higher quality products, we may not generate sufficient revenue to offset our development costs and other expenses or meet our customers\u2019 requirements.\nOur substrate products have a long qualification cycle that makes it difficult to plan our expenses and forecast our results.\nNew customers typically place orders with us for our substrate products three months to a year or more after our initial contact with them. The sale of our products may be subject to delays due to our customers\u2019 lengthy internal approval and evaluation processes. During this time, we may incur substantial expenses and expend sales, marketing and management efforts while the customers evaluate our products. These expenditures may not result in sales of our products. If we do not achieve anticipated sales in a period as expected, we may experience an unplanned shortfall in our revenue. As a result, we may not be able to cover expenses, causing our operating results to be adversely effected. In addition, if we fail to meet the product qualification requirements of the customer, we may not have another opportunity to sell products to this customer for many months or even years. In the current competitive climate, the average qualification and sales cycle for our products has lengthened even further and is expected to continue to make it difficult for us to forecast our future sales accurately. We anticipate that sales of any future substrate products will also have lengthy sales cycles and will, therefore, be subject to risks substantially similar to those inherent in the lengthy sales cycles of our current substrate products.\nIf any of our facilities are damaged by occurrences such as fire, explosion or natural disaster, we might not be able to manufacture our products.\nThe ongoing operation of our manufacturing and production facilities in China is critical to our ability to meet demand for our products. If we are not able to use all or a significant portion of our facilities for prolonged periods for any reason, we would not be able to manufacture products for our customers. For example, a fire or explosion caused by our use of combustible chemicals and high temperatures during our manufacturing processes or power interruption caused by severe weather conditions could render some or all of our facilities inoperable for an indefinite period of time. Actions outside of our control, such as earthquakes or other natural disasters, could also damage our facilities, rendering them inoperable. If we are unable to operate our facilities and manufacture our products, we would lose customers and revenue and our business would be harmed.\nIf China places restrictions on freight and transportation routes and on port of entry and departure this could result in shipping delays or increased costs for shipping.\nIn August 2015 there was an explosion at the Port of Tianjin, China. As a result of this incident the government placed some restrictions on importing certain materials and on freight routes used to transport these materials. We experienced some modest disruption from these restrictions. If the government were to place additional restrictions on the transportation of materials, then our ability to transport our raw materials or products could be limited and result in bottlenecks at shipping ports, affecting our ability to deliver products to our customers. During periods of such restrictions, we may increase our stock of critical materials (such as arsenic, gallium, and other chemicals) for use during the period that these restrictions are likely to last, which will increase our use of cash and increase our inventory level. Any of these restrictions could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition.\nThe financial condition of our customers may affect their ability to pay amounts owed to us.\nMany of our customers may be undercapitalized and cope with cash flow issues. Because of competitive market conditions, we frequently allow our customers extended payment terms when shipping products to them. Subsequent to our shipping a product, some customers have been unable to make payments when due, reducing our cash balances and causing us to incur charges to allow for a possibility that some accounts might not be paid. Customers may also be forced to file for bankruptcy. If our customers do not pay their accounts we will be required to incur charges that would reduce our earnings.\nWe have made and may continue to make strategic investments in raw materials suppliers, which may not be successful and may result in the loss of all or part of our investment.\nWe have made investments through our subsidiaries and joint ventures in raw material suppliers in China, which provide us with opportunities to gain supplies of key raw materials that are important to our substrate business.\nThese affiliates each have a market beyond that provided by us. We do not have influence over all of these companies and in some we have made only a strategic, minority investment. We may not be successful in achieving the financial, technological or commercial advantage upon which any given investment is premised, and we could end up losing all or part of our investment.\nWe depend on the continuing efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel. If we lose members of our senior management team or other key personnel, or are unable to successfully recruit and train qualified personnel, our ability to manufacture and sell our products could be harmed.\nOur future success depends on the continuing services of members of our senior management team and other key personnel. Our industry is characterized by high demand and intense competition for talent, and the turnover rate can be high. We compete for qualified management and other personnel with other semiconductor companies. Our employees could leave our company with little or no prior notice and would be free to work for a competitor. If one or more of our senior executives or other key personnel were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them easily or at all, and other senior management may be required to divert attention from other aspects of the business. The loss of any of these individuals or our ability to attract or retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.\nOur results of operations may suffer if we do not effectively manage our inventory.\nWe must manage our inventory of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods effectively to meet changing customer requirements, while keeping inventory costs down and improving gross margins. Although we seek to maintain sufficient inventory levels of certain materials to guard against interruptions in supply and to meet our near term needs, and have to date been able to obtain sufficient supplies of materials in a timely manner, in the future, we may experience shortages of certain key materials. Some of our products and supplies have in the past and may in the future become obsolete while in inventory due to changing customer specifications, or become excess inventory due to decreased demand for our products and an inability to sell the inventory within a foreseeable period. This would result in charges that reduce our gross profit. Furthermore, if market prices drop below the prices at which we value inventory, we may need to take a charge for a reduction in inventory values in accordance with the lower of cost or market valuation rule. We have in the past had to take inventory valuation and impairment charges. Any future unexpected changes in demand or increases in costs of production that cause us to take additional charges for un-saleable, obsolete or excess inventory, or to reduce inventory values, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nFinancial market volatility and adverse changes in the domestic and global economic environment could have a significant adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to the risks arising from adverse changes and uncertainty in domestic and global economies. Uncertain global economic conditions and low or negative growth in China, Europe and the United States, along with volatility in the financial markets, increasing national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions, pose challenges to our industry. Currently China\u2019s economy is slowing and this could impact our financial performance. Although we remain well-capitalized, the cost and availability of funds may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets. Turbulence in U.S. and international markets and economies may adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and profitability. Another severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business, including:\n\u00b7\nincreased volatility in our stock price;\n\u00b7\nincreased volatility in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u00b7\ndelays in, or curtailment of, purchasing decisions by our customers or potential customers either as a result of overall economic uncertainty or as a result of their inability to access the liquidity necessary to engage in purchasing initiatives;\n\u00b7\nincreased credit risk associated with our customers or potential customers, particularly those that may operate in industries most affected by the economic downturn; and\n\u00b7\nimpairment of our intangible or other assets.\nIn the recent past we experienced delays in customer purchasing decisions and disruptions in normal volume of customer orders that we believe were in part due to the uncertainties in the global economy and an adverse impact on consumer spending. During challenging and uncertain economic times and in tight credit markets, many customers delay or reduce technology purchases. Should similar events occur again, our business and operating results could be significantly and adversely affected.\nGlobal economic conditions may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.\nOur operations and financial results depend on worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of business spending, which had deteriorated significantly in many countries and regions in previous years. Uncertainties in the financial and credit markets may cause our customers to postpone deliveries of ordered systems and placement of new orders and extended uncertainties may reduce future sales of our products and services. The revenue growth and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for our substrates, and we are particularly dependent on the market conditions for the wireless, solid-state illumination, fiber optics and telecommunications industries. Because the end users of our products are primarily large companies whose businesses fluctuate with general economic and business conditions, a softening of demand for products that use our substrates, caused by a weakening economy, may result in decreased revenue. Customers may find themselves facing excess inventory from earlier purchases, and may defer or reconsider purchasing products due to the downturn in their business and in the general economy. If market conditions deteriorate, we may experience increased collection times and greater write-offs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and our cash flow.\nFuture tightening of credit markets and concerns regarding the availability of credit may make it more difficult for our customers to raise capital, whether debt or equity, to finance their purchases of capital equipment or of the products we sell. Delays in our customers\u2019 ability to obtain such financing, or the unavailability of such financing, would adversely affect our product sales and revenues and therefore harm our business and operating results. We cannot predict the timing, duration of or effect on our business of any future economic downturn or the timing or strength of any subsequent recovery.\nWe may not be able to identify additional complementary joint ventures.\nAlthough we are not currently pursuing additional joint ventures, in the future we might continue to invest in additional joint ventures in order to remain competitive in our marketplace and ensure a supply of critical raw materials. However, we may not be able to identify additional complementary joint venture opportunities or, even once opportunities are identified, we may not be able to reach agreement on the terms of the venture with the other venture partners. Additional joint ventures could cause us to incur contingent liabilities or other expenses, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nThe effect of terrorist threats and actions on the general economy could decrease our revenue.\nDeveloped countries such as the United States and China continue to be on alert for terrorist activity. The potential near- and long-term impact terrorist activities may have in regards to our suppliers, customers and markets for our products and the economy is uncertain. There may be embargos of ports or products, or destruction of shipments or our facilities, or attacks that affect our personnel. There may be other potentially adverse effects on our operating results due to significant events that we cannot foresee. Since we perform all of our manufacturing operations in China, terrorist activity or threats against U.S.-owned enterprises are a particular concern to us.\nII.\nRisks Related to International Aspects of Our Business\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from international sales, and our ability to sustain and increase our international sales involves significant risks.\nOur revenue growth depends in part on the expansion of our international sales and operations. International sales represented over 80% of our revenue in each of the past three years since 2013. We expect that sales to customers outside the United States, particularly sales to customers in Japan, Taiwan and China, will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue.\nCurrently, a significant percentage of our revenue is to customers headquartered in Asia. All of our manufacturing facilities and most of our suppliers are also located outside the United States. Managing our overseas operations presents challenges, including periodic regional economic downturns, trade balance issues, varying business conditions and demands, political instability, variations in enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in different jurisdictions, differences in the ability to develop relationships with suppliers and other local businesses, changes in U.S. and international laws and regulations including U.S. export restrictions, fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates, the ability to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations, cultural differences, shipping delays and terrorist acts or acts of war, among other risks. Many of these challenges are present in China, which represents a large potential market for semiconductor devices. Global uncertainties with respect to: (i) economic growth rates in various countries; (ii) sustainability of demand for electronics products; (iii) capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers; (iv) price weakness for certain semiconductor devices; (v) changing and tightening environmental regulations and (vi) political instability in regions where we have operations may also affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur dependence on international sales involves a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7\nchanges in tariffs, import restrictions, export restrictions, or other trade barriers;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u00b7\nlonger periods to collect accounts receivable;\n\u00b7\nchanges in export license requirements;\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic instability;\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; and\n\u00b7\nforeign exchange rate fluctuations.\nOur sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, except for sales to our Chinese customers which are denominated in Renminbi and our Japanese customers which are denominated in Japanese yen. Increases in the value of the U.S. dollar could increase the price of our products in non-U.S. markets and make our products more expensive than competitors\u2019 products in these markets.\nDenominating some sales in Japanese yen subjects us to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen. For example, in the second half of 2014, the exchange rate of Japanese yen to U.S. dollar moved from 101.55 to 119.95 from June 30, 2014 to December 31, 2014. As a result, in 2014 we incurred foreign currency transaction exchange losses which are included in \u201cother income (expense), net\u201d on the consolidated statements of operations of $1.0 million. We incur transaction gains or losses resulting from the purchase and sale activities denominated in foreign currencies other than functional currencies at the respective consolidated entities. We accumulate translation gain or losses resulting from marking certain balance sheet assets and liabilities to the current market rate for\nthose consolidated entities whose functional currencies are other than the reporting currency, which are recorded as component of \u201caccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe functional currency of our Chinese subsidiary and joint ventures is the local currency. If we do not effectively manage the risks associated with international sales, our revenue, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nChanges in tariffs, import or export restrictions, Chinese regulations or other trade barriers may reduce gross margins.\nWe may incur increases in costs due to changes in tariffs, import or export restrictions, or other trade barriers, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, any of which could reduce our gross margins. For example, in July 2012, we received notice of retroactive value-added taxes (VATs) levied by the tax authorities in China which applied for the period from July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2012. We expensed the retroactive VATs of approximately $1.3 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2012, which resulted in a decrease in our gross margins. These VATs will continue to negatively impact our gross margins for the future quarters. Given the relatively fluid regulatory environment in China, there could be additional tax or other regulatory changes in the future. Any such changes could directly and materially adversely impact our financial results and general business condition.\nOur operating results depend in large part on continued customer acceptance of our substrate products manufactured in China and continued improvements in product quality.\nWe manufacture all of our products in China, and source most of our raw materials in China. We have in the past experienced quality problems with our China-manufactured products. Our previous quality problems caused us to lose market share to our competitors, as some customers reduced their orders from us until our surface quality was as good and consistent as that offered by competitors and instead allocated their requirements for compound semiconductor substrates to our competitors. If we are unable to continue to achieve customer qualifications for our products, or if we are unable to control product quality, customers may not increase purchases of our products, our China facility will become underutilized, and we will be unable to achieve revenue growth.\nChanges in China\u2019s political, social, regulatory or economic environments may affect our financial performance.\nOur financial performance may be affected by changes in China\u2019s political, social, regulatory or economic environments. The role of the Chinese central and local governments in the Chinese economy is significant. Chinese policies toward economic liberalization, and laws and policies affecting technology companies, foreign investment, currency exchange rates, taxation structure and other matters could change, resulting in greater restrictions on our ability to do business and operate our manufacturing facilities in China. Any imposition of surcharges or any increase in Chinese tax rates or reduction or elimination of Chinese tax benefits could hurt our operating results. The Chinese government could revoke, terminate or suspend our operating license for reasons related to environmental control over the use of hazardous materials, labor complaints, national security and similar reasons without compensation to us. If the Chinese government were to take any of these actions, we would be prevented from conducting all or part of our business. Any failure on our part to comply with governmental regulations could result in the loss of our ability to manufacture our products.\nIf there are power shortages in China, we may have to temporarily close our China operations, which would adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and meet customer orders, and would result in reduced revenue.\nIn the past, China has faced power shortages resulting in power demand outstripping supply in peak periods. Instability in electrical supply has caused sporadic outages among residential and commercial consumers causing the Chinese government to implement tough measures to ease the energy shortage. If further problems with power shortages occur in the future, we may be required to make temporary closures of our operations or of our subsidiary and joint venture operations. We may be unable to manufacture our products and would then be unable to meet customer orders except from inventory on hand. As a result, our revenue could be adversely impacted, and our relationships with our\ncustomers could suffer, impacting our ability to generate future revenue. In addition, if power is shut off at any of our facilities at any time, either voluntarily or as a result of unplanned brownouts, during certain phases of our manufacturing process including our crystal growth phase, the work in process may be ruined and rendered unusable, causing us to incur costs that will not be covered by revenue, and negatively impacting our cost of revenue and gross margins.\nAn outbreak of a contagious disease such as Ebola, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or the Avian Flu may adversely impact our manufacturing operations and some of our key suppliers and customers.\nAny reoccurrence of SARS or an outbreak of a contagious disease, such as Avian Flu or Ebola, may cause us to temporarily close our manufacturing operations. Similarly, if one or more of our key suppliers is required to close for an extended period, we might not have enough raw material inventories to continue manufacturing operations. In addition, while we possess management skills among our China staff that enable us to maintain our manufacturing operations with minimal on-site supervision from our U.S.-based staff, our business could also be harmed if travel to or from China and the United States is restricted or inadvisable. If our manufacturing operations were closed for a significant period, we could lose revenue and market share, which would depress our financial performance and could be difficult to recapture. Finally, if one of our key customers is required to close for an extended period, we might not be able to ship product to them, our revenue would decline and our financial performance would suffer.\nIII.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Results and Capital Structure\nIf we fail to manage periodic contractions, we may utilize our cash balances, resulting in the decline of our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances.\nWe anticipate that our existing cash resources will fund our operations and purchases of capital equipment, as well as provide adequate working capital for the next twelve months. However, our liquidity is affected by many factors including, among others, the extent to which we pursue additional capital expenditures, the level of our production, and other factors related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economies. If we fail to manage business contractions successfully we may draw down our cash reserves, which would adversely affect our financial condition, reduce our value and possibly impinge our ability to raise debt and equity funding in the future, at a time when we might need to raise additional cash. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that events in the future will not require us to seek additional capital or, if required, that such capital would be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. As part of our effort to reduce costs, we may lose key staff, production resources and technology that we will need to replenish when end markets recover. These events could reduce our ability to grow profitably as markets recover.\nUnpredictable fluctuations in our operating results could disappoint analysts or our investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant fluctuations in our revenue, gross margins and earnings. Our quarterly and annual revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nour ability to develop, manufacture and deliver high quality products in a timely and cost-effective manner;\n\u00b7\ndecline in general economic conditions or downturns in the industry in which we compete;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in demand for our products;\n\u00b7\nexpansion of our manufacturing capacity;\n\u00b7\nexpansion of our operations in China;\n\u00b7\nlimited availability and increased cost of raw materials;\n\u00b7\nthe volume and timing of orders from our customers, and cancellations, push-outs and delays of customer orders once booked;\n\u00b7\nfluctuation of our manufacturing yields;\n\u00b7\ndecreases in the prices of our or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u00b7\ncosts incurred in connection with any future acquisitions of businesses or technologies; and\n\u00b7\nincreases in our expenses, including expenses for research and development.\nDue to these factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful indicators of our future performance.\nA substantial percentage of our operating expenses are fixed, and we may be unable to adjust spending to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenue. As a result, any delay in generating revenue could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of market analysts or investors, which could also cause our stock price to decline.\nIf our operating results and financial performance do not meet the guidance that we have provided to the public, our stock price may decline.\nWe provide public guidance on our expected operating and financial results. Although we believe that this guidance provides our stockholders, investors and analysts with a better understanding of our expectations for the future, such guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to the risks and uncertainties described in this report and in our other public filings and public statements. Our actual results may not meet the guidance we have provided. If our operating or financial results do not meet our guidance or the expectations of investment analysts, our stock price may decline.\nWe have adopted certain anti-takeover measures that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us.\nOur board of directors has the authority to issue up to 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future. The issuance of shares of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. We have no present intention to issue additional shares of preferred stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger, acquisition or change of control, or changes in our management, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. The following are some examples of these provisions:\n\u00b7\nthe division of our board of directors into three separate classes, each with three-year terms;\n\u00b7\nthe right of our board to elect a director to fill a space created by a board vacancy or the expansion of the board;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our board to alter our amended and restated bylaws; and\n\u00b7\nthe requirement that only our board or the holders of at least 10% of our outstanding shares may call a special meeting of our stockholders.\nFurthermore, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. These provisions prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder (a stockholder who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock) for a period of three years following the time that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless:\n\u00b7\n662/3% of the shares of voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder approve the merger or combination, or\n\u00b7\nthe board of directors approves the merger or combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder.\nOur common stock may be delisted from The Nasdaq Global Select Market, which could negatively impact the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets.\nOur common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. The bid price of our common stock has in the past closed below the $1.00 minimum per share bid price required for continued inclusion on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under Marketplace Rule 5450(a). If the bid price of our common stock remains below $1.00 per share for thirty consecutive business days, we could be subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nAny delisting from The Nasdaq Global Select Market could have an adverse effect on our business and on the trading of our common stock. If a delisting of our common stock were to occur, our common stock would trade on the OTC Bulletin Board or on the \u201cpink sheets\u201d maintained by the National Quotation Bureau, Inc. Such alternatives are generally considered to be less efficient markets, and our stock price, as well as the liquidity of our common stock, may be adversely impacted as a result. Delisting from The Nasdaq Global Select Market could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers and employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities, as well as the loss of liquidity for our stockholders.\nIV.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIntellectual property infringement claims may be costly to resolve and could divert management attention.\nOther companies may hold or obtain patents on inventions or may otherwise claim proprietary rights to technology necessary to our business. The markets in which we compete are comprised of competitors that in some cases hold substantial patent portfolios covering aspects of products that could be similar to ours. We could become subject to claims that we are infringing patent, trademark, copyright or other proprietary rights of others. We have in the past been involved in lawsuits alleging patent infringement, and could in the future be involved in similar litigation. For example, we entered into a settlement agreement with Sumitomo Electric Industries in 2011 to settle its claim of patent infringement.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, including our proprietary process technology, we may lose valuable assets or incur costly litigation.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and trade secret laws, non-disclosure agreements and other intellectual property protection methods to protect our proprietary technology. However, we believe that, due to the rapid pace of technological innovation in the markets for our products, our ability to establish and maintain a position of technology leadership also depends on the skills of our development personnel. We believe that our internal, non-patented proprietary process technology methods, systems and processes are a valuable and critical element of our intellectual property. We must establish and maintain safeguards to avoid the theft of these processes. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, third parties can develop products or processes similar to ours. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate, and our competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our products or design around our patents. We believe that at least two of our competitors have begun to ship GaAs substrates produced using a process similar to our VGF process. Our competitors may also develop and patent improvements to the VGF technology upon which we rely, and thus may limit any exclusivity we enjoy by virtue of our patents or trade secrets.\nIt is possible that pending or future United States or foreign patent applications made by us will not be approved, that our issued patents will not protect our intellectual property, or that third parties will challenge our ownership rights or the validity of our patents. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States and it may be more difficult to monitor the use of our intellectual property. Our competitors may be able to legitimately ascertain non-patented proprietary technology embedded in our systems. If this occurs, we may not be able to prevent the development of technology substantially similar to ours.\nWe may have to resort to costly litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or know-how or to determine their scope, validity or enforceability. Enforcing or defending our proprietary technology is expensive, could cause us to divert resources and may not prove successful. Our protective measures may prove inadequate to protect our proprietary rights, and if we fail to enforce or protect our rights, we could lose valuable assets.\nV.\nRisks Related to Compliance and Other Legal Matters\nWe need to continue to improve or implement our systems, procedures and controls.\nWe rely on certain manual processes for data collection and information processing, as do our joint venture companies. If we fail to manage these procedures properly or fail to effectively manage a transition from manual processes to automated processes, our systems and controls may be disrupted. To manage our business effectively, we may need to implement additional management information systems, further develop our operating, administrative, financial and accounting systems and controls, add experienced senior level managers, and maintain close coordination among our executive, engineering, accounting, marketing, sales and operations organizations.\nWe are subject to internal control evaluations and attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we must include in our Annual Report on Form 10-K a report of management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Ongoing compliance with this requirement is complex, costly and time-consuming. If: (1) we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting; or (2) our management does not timely assess the adequacy of such internal control, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and the public\u2019s perception of us may be adversely impacted.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental and safety regulations, we may be subject to significant fines or forced to cease our operations; in addition, we could be subject to suits for personal injuries caused by hazardous materials.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations in all of our operating locations, including laws and regulations of China, such as laws and regulations related to the development, manufacture and use of our products, the use of hazardous materials, the operation of our facilities, and the use of our real property. These laws and regulations govern the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals during manufacturing, research and development, and sales demonstrations. If we fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could be subject to substantial liability for clean-up efforts, personal injury and fines or suspension or be forced to cease our operations, and/or suspend or terminate the development, manufacture or use of certain of our products, the use of our facilities, or the use of our real property, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, the Chinese government issues new regulations, which may require additional actions on our part to comply. On February 27, 2015, the China State Administration of Work Safety updated its list of hazardous substances. The previous list, which was published in 2002, did not restrict the materials that we use in our wafers. The new list added gallium arsenide. As a result of the newly published list, we were required to obtain a permit by May 1, 2015 to continue to manufacture our gallium arsenide substrate wafers. We initiated discussions with the local district agency to obtain the requisite permit. On May 4, 2015, we were instructed by the local district agency that because we had not yet received the requisite permit, we should cease manufacturing our gallium arsenide substrate wafers or we should obtain permission to continue manufacturing our gallium arsenide substrate wafers from a municipal-level office, such as the Beijing municipal authority. The Beijing municipal authority accepted our application on May 7, 2015 and\nour application is still under review. There can be no assurances that we will receive the requisite permit from the Beijing municipal authority or from any other Chinese governmental authority. If we do not receive the requisite permit to continue to manufacture gallium arsenide substrate wafers, we may be required to cease manufacturing such wafers until we receive the requisite permit or move such manufacturing to a new location. A halt to our production of gallium arsenide substrate wafers could result in our furloughing approximately several hundred manufacturing employees. If we obtain the requisite permit after halting our production, we might not be able to recommence manufacturing gallium arsenide substrate wafers immediately because we may need to rebuild our supply chain and we may not be able to rehire our furloughed manufacturing employees. We could also lose customers to our competitors because of our inability to supply gallium arsenide substrate wafers. Any of these could materially and adversely impact our results of operations and our financial condition.\nIn addition, in 2005, a complaint was filed against us alleging personal injury, general negligence, intentional tort, wage loss and other damages, including punitive damages, as a result of exposure of plaintiffs to high levels of gallium arsenide in gallium arsenide wafers, and methanol. Other current and/or former employees could bring litigation against us in the future. Although we have in place engineering, administrative and personnel protective equipment programs to address these issues, our ability to expand or continue to operate our present locations could be restricted or we could be required to acquire costly remediation equipment or incur other significant expenses if we were found liable for failure to comply with environmental and safety regulations. Existing or future changes in laws or regulations in the United States and China may require us to incur significant expenditures or liabilities, or may restrict our operations. In addition, our employees could be exposed to chemicals or other hazardous materials at our facilities and we may be subject to lawsuits seeking damages for wrongful death or personal injuries allegedly caused by exposure to chemicals or hazardous materials at our facilities.\nLitigation is inherently uncertain and while we would expect to defend ourselves vigorously, it is possible that our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period by litigation pending and any additional litigation brought against us. In addition, future litigation could divert management\u2019s attention from our business and operations, causing our business and financial results to suffer. We could incur defense or settlement costs in excess of the insurance covering these litigation matters, or that could result in significant judgments against us or cause us to incur costly settlements, in excess of our insurance limits.", "PERMNO": 86051, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "AXTI"}
