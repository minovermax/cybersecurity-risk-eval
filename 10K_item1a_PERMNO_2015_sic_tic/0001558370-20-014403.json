Risk Factors\nRisk Factor Summary\nWe are providing the following summary of the risk factors contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to enhance the readability and accessibility of our risk factor disclosures. We encourage you to carefully review the full risk factors contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in their entirety for additional information regarding the material factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf We are subject to risks related to COVID-19;\n\u25cf Clinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome;\n\u25cf Our future success is dependent primarily on the regulatory approval for commercialization of a single product candidate, which is in the clinical development stage;\n\u25cf We may not be able to obtain required regulatory approvals for our proposed products;\n\u25cf We may not be able to successfully commercialize our Aniten series of compounds;\n\u25cf Our product candidate and potential future product candidates may have undesirable side effects that may delay or prevent marketing approval or, if approval is received, require them to be taken off the market, require them to include safety warnings or otherwise limit their sales;\n\u25cf Even if we obtain marketing approval for any product candidate and potential future products, we will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense;\n\u25cf We may fail to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, which may result in administrative or judicial sanctions;\n\u25cf We have limited experience manufacturing product candidates on a large clinical or commercial scale and have no manufacturing facility\n\u25cf We rely on third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, this could substantially harm our business because we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize product candidates in a timely manner or at all;\n\u25cf Our business may be materially adversely affected by new legislation, new regulatory requirements and the continuing efforts of governmental and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare through various means;\n\u25cf We will have significant additional future capital needs for future clinical trials and there are uncertainties as to the Company\u2019s ability to raise additional funding;\n\u25cf We may not be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms, which may result in dilution to our existing shareholders, restrictions on our operations or the requirement for us to relinquish rights to technologies or any future product candidates;\n\u25cf We have incurred significant losses in every quarter since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses in the future and may never generate profits from operations or maintain profitability;\n\u25cf We have a limited operating history, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability;\n\u25cf We rely on proprietary technology, the protection of which can be unpredictable and costly;\n\u25cf We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world;\n\u25cf We may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that we, or our employees or consultants have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property;\n\u25cf Our business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures or security breaches;\n\u25cf We face intense competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively;\n\u25cf We have never marketed a drug before, and if we are unable to establish an effective sales force and marketing infrastructure, or enter into acceptable third-party sales and marketing or licensing arrangements, we may be unable to generate any revenue;\n\u25cf Our product candidate and potential future products may, if approved for sale, not achieve or maintain expected levels of market acceptance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of our securities to decline;\n\u25cf Laws and regulations governing international operations may preclude us from developing, manufacturing and selling certain product candidates outside of the United States and Canada and require us to develop and implement costly compliance programs;\n\u25cf We are and there is a risk that we may continue to be a \u201cpassive foreign investment company\u201d which would likely result in materially adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences for U.S. investors; and\n\u25cf The market price and trading volume of our Common Shares may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our shareholders or securities litigation.\nRisk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the following risk factors, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. If any of the events described in the following risks actually occur, our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including the risks described below. See \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d The risks below are not the only risks facing our company. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and/or prospects.\nRisks Relating to COVID-19\nIn December 2019, COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. Since then, COVID-19 has spread to multiple countries, including the United States, Canada, and all European countries. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. COVID-19 has had a broad adverse impact on the global economy across many industries and has resulted in significant governmental measures being implemented to control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, travel restrictions and business shutdowns, as well as significant volatility in global financial markets. Although COVID-19 has not yet had any material impact on our business, operations or financial condition, there can be no assurances that it will not have an impact on our business, operations or financial condition going forward. In March 2020, the Company made the decision to transition employees to primarily remote working arrangements. This continues to the present, but the Company has taken steps to maintain internal communication, and operations have thus far continued on schedule and with minimal interruption. In particular, the Company has been able to continue to move towards activating initial clinical trial sites; with patients being dosed, and with additional patients in screening. The potential still remains that we may experience future delays with third party vendors operations being impacted by COVID-19 and delays in clinical trial activities relating to the diversion of global healthcare resources to higher priority COVID-19 related response activities. Therefore COVID-19-related effects have not yet had a material impact on our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity or strategic long-term development and commercialization plans.\nWhile the Company will continue to work to minimize any emerging complications, the extent to which COVID-19 may cause more significant disruptions to our business and operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be definitively predicted. These uncertainties include the duration of the outbreak, the extent of travel restrictions and social distancing measures, the continued severity of the virus outbreak and the ability to treat it, the ability to collect sufficient data to track the virus, the collective actions taken to curb the spread of the virus, and the effectiveness of actions taken to contain and treat the disease and to address its impact, including its impact on global financial markets.\nIf the COVID-19 pandemic worsens or continues for a prolonged period of time, we could experience disruptions that could significantly impact our current and planned clinical trials, preclinical studies and our business activities including:\n\u25cf delays or difficulties in initiating clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in our current and potential future clinical trials of EPI-7386;\n\u25cf disruption to and delays in preclinical research and analysis activities due to an extended temporary closure of contract lab facilities;\n\u25cf disruptions in supply, logistics or other activities related to the procurement of materials, which could have a negative impact on our ability to conduct preclinical studies, initiate or complete our clinical trials or commercialize our product candidates;\n\u25cf diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials;\n\u25cf interruption of key preclinical studies and clinical trial activities, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal, state, provincial or municipal governments, employers and others;\n\u25cf limitations in resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our business or our current or planned preclinical studies or clinical trials, including due to sickness, restrictions on travel, prolonged stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders and other COVID-19 related concerns;\n\u25cf changes in regulations as part of a response to the COVID-19 outbreak which may require us to change the ways in which our preclinical studies and clinical trials are conducted and incur unexpected costs, or requires us to discontinue our preclinical research or clinical trials altogether;\n\u25cf delays in receiving regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf delays in necessary interactions with regulators, ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or furlough of government or contractor personnel; and\n\u25cf limitations on our ability to recruit preclinical research, clinical, regulatory and other professional staff on the timeframe required to support our research and development programs.\nIn addition, COVID-19 could result in continued significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could have negative future impacts on our liquidity and financial condition. Financial volatility has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the value of our Common Shares.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial condition is uncertain, and a continued and prolonged public health crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material negative impact on our business, operations and financial condition. We will continue to monitor the effectors of COVID-19 on an ongoing basis.\nESSA\u2019s Product Candidate and Regulatory Matters\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results and ESSA\u2019s product candidate and potential future product candidates may not have favorable results in later trials or in the commercial setting or satisfy the requirements of the FDA or non-US regulatory authorities.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. ESSA\u2019s planned clinical trials may produce negative or inconclusive results, and ESSA or any of its current and future collaborators may decide, or regulators may require ESSA, to conduct additional clinical or preclinical testing. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Preclinical tests and Phase I and Phase II clinical trials are primarily designed to test safety, to study pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and to understand the side effects of product candidates at various doses and schedules. Success in preclinical or animal studies and early clinical trials does not ensure that later large-scale efficacy trials will be successful nor does it predict final results. Favorable results in early trials may not be repeated in later trials. The Company cannot assure you that the FDA, TPD or EMA or other similar government bodies will view the results as the Company does, or that any future trials of ESSA\u2019s proposed products for other indications will achieve positive results. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials.\nA number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Any current or future clinical trial results for ESSA\u2019s proposed products may not be successful. Similarly, preclinical interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. A number of factors could contribute to a lack of favorable safety and efficacy results for ESSA\u2019s proposed products for other indications. For example, such trials could result in increased variability due to varying site characteristics, such as local standards of care, differences in evaluation period and due to varying patient characteristics including demographic factors and health status. There can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s clinical trials will demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy for the FDA EMA to approve ESSA\u2019s potential products for the treatment of CRPC, or any other indication that the Company may consider in any additional NDA or NDS submissions for ESSA\u2019s potential products.\nThe Company will be required to demonstrate through large scale clinical trials that any product candidate and potential future product candidate is safe and effective for use in a diverse population before ESSA can seek regulatory approvals for its commercial sale. There is typically an extremely high rate of attrition from the failure of product candidates proceeding through clinical and post-approval trials. If ESSA\u2019s potential products fail to demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy in ongoing or future clinical trials, the Company could experience potentially significant delays in, or be required to abandon development of a product candidate.\nIn addition, clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed by research organizations and other independent third parties may yield negative results regarding the effect of ESSA\u2019s potential products on CRPC, either in absolute terms or relative to other products.\nESSA\u2019s future success is dependent primarily on the regulatory approval for commercialization of a single product candidate, which is in the clinical development stage.\nThe Company does not have any products that have obtained regulatory approval for commercialization. Currently, ESSA is engaged in the clinical testing of a product candidate, EPI-7386, to take forward from its Aniten series of compounds through clinical development to determine the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetics and potential therapeutic benefits of such candidate in patients with CRPC, and to ultimately receive regulatory approval. As a result, the Company\u2019s near-term prospects, including its ability to finance its operations and generate revenue, are substantially dependent on its ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, and, if approved, to successfully commercialize a product candidate in a timely manner. ESSA cannot commercialize its product candidates in the United States without first conducting multiple preclinical and clinical trials to establish the product\u2019s safety and efficacy and obtaining regulatory approval for the product from the FDA; similarly, ESSA cannot commercialize its product candidates outside of the United States without obtaining regulatory approval from comparable foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA development and review process typically varies in time and may take years to complete and approval is not guaranteed. Developing, obtaining regulatory approval for and successfully commercializing ESSA\u2019s product candidates will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf successfully completing formulation and process development activities;\n\u25cf completing multiple clinical trials that demonstrate the efficacy and safety of ESSA\u2019s product candidates;\n\u25cf receiving marketing approval from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities;\n\u25cf launching commercial sales, marketing and distribution operations;\n\u25cf acceptance of ESSA\u2019s product candidates by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u25cf a continued acceptable safety profile following approval; and\n\u25cf competing effectively with other therapies, including with respect to the sales and marketing of ESSA\u2019s product candidates, if approved.\nMany of these factors are wholly or partially beyond ESSA\u2019s control, including clinical development, the regulatory submission process and changes in the competitive landscape. If ESSA does not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner, it could experience significant delays or an inability to develop ESSA\u2019s product candidates at all.\nIf the Company breaches any of the agreements under which the Company licenses rights to its technology from third parties, the Company could lose license rights that are important to ESSA\u2019s business. ESSA\u2019s current license agreement may not provide an adequate remedy for its breach by the licensor.\nESSA entered into a License Agreement with UBC and the BC Cancer Agency that covers certain Aniten compound candidates. The Company is subject to a number of risks associated with the Company\u2019s collaboration with UBC and the BC Cancer Agency, including the risk that UBC or the BC Cancer Agency may terminate the License Agreement upon the occurrence of certain specified events. ESSA\u2019s License Agreement requires, among other things, that the Company make certain payments and use reasonable commercial efforts to meet certain clinical and regulatory milestones. See \u201cPatents and Proprietary Rights\u201d in Item 4 of this Annual Report. If ESSA fails to comply with any of these obligations or otherwise breaches this or similar agreements, UBC, the BC Cancer Agency or any future licensors may have the right to terminate the license. ESSA could also suffer the consequences of non-compliance or breaches by licensors in connection with ESSA\u2019s license agreements. Such non-compliance or breaches by such third parties could in turn result in ESSA\u2019s breaches or defaults under the Company\u2019s agreements with the Company\u2019s other collaboration partners, and the Company could be found liable for damages or lose certain rights, including rights to develop and/or commercialize a product or product candidate. Loss of ESSA\u2019s rights to the Licensed IP or any similar license granted to ESSA in the future, or the exclusivity rights provided therein, could harm ESSA\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nThe Company may not be able to obtain required regulatory approvals for the Company\u2019s proposed products.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, approval, sale, marketing, advertising and promotion, pricing, export, import and distribution of drug products developed by ESSA or ESSA\u2019s future collaborative partners, if any, is subject to extensive regulation by federal, provincial, state and local governmental authorities and those regulations differ from country to country. ESSA\u2019s product candidate and potential future product candidates will be principally regulated in the United States by the FDA, in the European Union by the EMA and the regulators in the individual European Union member countries, in Canada by the TPD, and by other similar regulatory authorities in Japan and other jurisdictions. Government regulation substantially increases the cost and risk of researching, developing, manufacturing and selling products. Following several widely publicized issues in recent years, the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions have become increasingly focused on product safety. This development has led to requests for more clinical trial data, for the inclusion of a significantly higher number of patients in clinical trials and for more detailed analysis of trial results. Consequently, the process of obtaining regulatory approvals, particularly from the FDA, is time-consuming and has become more costly than in the past. Any product developed by ESSA or ESSA\u2019s future collaborative partners, if any, must receive all relevant regulatory approvals or clearances from the applicable regulatory authorities before it may be marketed and sold in a particular country.\nESSA will not be permitted to market any potential products in the United States, Europe, Japan, Canada or in other countries where ESSA intends to market its product candidate and potential future product candidates until such product candidate receives approval of a NDA from the FDA or similar approval in other countries as restrictions apply. In the United States, the FDA generally requires the completion of preclinical testing and clinical trials of each drug to establish its safety and efficacy and extensive pharmaceutical development to ensure its quality before an NDA is approved. This process takes many years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources and may include post-marketing studies and surveillance. Regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions impose similar requirements. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage result in the submission of an NDA to the FDA and even fewer are approved for commercialization. Other than the INDs submitted for EPI-506 and EPI-7386, the Company has not submitted an IND or an NDA to date for any of the Company\u2019s potential products to the FDA or comparable applications to other regulatory authorities. If the Company\u2019s development efforts for potential products are not successful for the treatment of CRPC and regulatory approval is not obtained in a timely fashion or at all, the Company\u2019s business will be adversely affected.\nThe receipt of required regulatory approvals for the Company\u2019s product candidate and potential future product candidate(s) is uncertain and subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf the FDA, IRBs or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of the Company\u2019s clinical trials;\n\u25cf the Company may not be able to provide acceptable evidence of the safety, efficacy or quality of its potential products;\n\u25cf the results of the Company\u2019s clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for marketing approval;\n\u25cf the dosing of the Company\u2019s potential products in a particular clinical trial may not be at an optimal level;\n\u25cf patients in the Company\u2019s clinical trials may suffer adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to the Company\u2019s potential products;\n\u25cf the data collected from the Company\u2019s clinical trials may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA for the Company\u2019s potential products or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States, Europe, Japan, Canada, or elsewhere;\n\u25cf the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may find deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which the Company contracts for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n\u25cf the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering the Company\u2019s clinical data insufficient for approval.\nThe FDA and other regulators have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that the Company\u2019s data is insufficient for approval and require additional clinical trials, or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval of the Company\u2019s potential products. ESSA, or ESSA\u2019s future collaborative partner, if any, must obtain and maintain regulatory authorization to conduct clinical trials. ESSA\u2019s preclinical research is subject to GLP and other requirements and ESSA\u2019s clinical research is subject to good clinical practice and other requirements. Failure to adhere to these requirements could invalidate ESSA\u2019s data. In addition, the relevant regulatory authority or independent review board may modify, suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the benefits. Further, the process of obtaining regulatory approvals is expensive, often takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon, among other things, the type, complexity and novelty of the prescription product candidates involved, the jurisdiction in which regulatory approval is sought and the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. If regulatory approval is obtained in one jurisdiction, it does not necessarily mean that ESSA\u2019s potential products will receive regulatory approval in all jurisdictions in which the Company may seek approval, or any regulatory approval obtained may not be as broad as what was obtained in other jurisdictions. However, the failure to obtain approval for ESSA\u2019s potential products in one or more jurisdictions may negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to obtain approval in a different jurisdiction. Accordingly, despite ESSA\u2019s expenditures and investment of time and effort, it may be unable to receive required regulatory approvals for product candidates developed by it. If a significant portion of these development efforts are not successfully completed, required regulatory approvals are not obtained, or any approved products are not commercially successful, ESSA\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed.\nAs an organization, ESSA has never submitted an NDA/NDS and may be unable to do so for any future products ESSA develops.\nESSA is currently undergoing a Phase I clinical trial for EPI-7386. ESSA will need to conduct Phase II and Phase III clinical trials, which it has not previously undertaken. The conduct of Phase III clinical trials and the submission of a successful IND or CTA and NDA or NDS is a complicated process. As an organization, ESSA has limited experience in preparing, submitting and prosecuting regulatory filings and has not submitted an NDA or NDS. ESSA\u2019s interactions with the FDA to date have been limited to the completed EPI-506 clinical trial and the initiation of the Phase I clinical trial for EPI-7386. Consequently, even if ESSA\u2019s initial clinical trials are successful, the Company may be unable to successfully and efficiently execute and complete necessary clinical trials in a way that leads to NDA or NDS submission and approval of ESSA\u2019s proposed products or any other future product candidate ESSA may develop. The Company may require more time and incur greater costs than competitors and may not succeed in obtaining regulatory approvals of products that the Company develops. Failure to commence or complete, or delays in, ESSA\u2019s planned clinical trials, would prevent ESSA from or delay ESSA in commercializing proposed products or any other future product candidate ESSA develops.\nESSA may not be able to successfully commercialize its Aniten series of compounds.\nEven if a candidate from ESSA\u2019s Aniten series were to be successfully developed and obtain approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, any approval might contain significant limitations related to use restrictions for specified age groups, warnings, precautions or contraindications, may be subject to burdensome post-approval study or risk management requirements, or may be limited to a subset of CRPC patients with limited commercial value. If ESSA is unable to obtain regulatory approval in one or more jurisdictions, or any approval contains significant limitations, ESSA may not be able to obtain sufficient funding or generate sufficient revenue to continue the development of any other future product candidates that ESSA may discover, in-license, develop or acquire in the future. Also, any regulatory approval of any future product candidates, once obtained, may be withdrawn. Furthermore, even if ESSA obtains regulatory approval for a product candidate, the commercial success of such product candidate will depend on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u25cf development of a commercial organization or establishment of a commercial collaboration with a commercial infrastructure;\n\u25cf establishment of commercially viable pricing and approval for adequate reimbursement from third-party and government payors;\n\u25cf the ability of ESSA\u2019s third-party manufacturers to manufacture quantities of the compound using commercially efficient processes and at a scale sufficient to meet anticipated demand and enable ESSA to reduce its cost of manufacturing;\n\u25cf ESSA\u2019s success in educating physicians and patients about the benefits, administration and use of the compound;\n\u25cf the availability, perceived advantages, relative cost, relative safety and relative efficacy of alternative and competing treatments;\n\u25cf the effectiveness of ESSA\u2019s own or its potential strategic collaborators\u2019 marketing, sales and distribution strategy and operations;\n\u25cf acceptance of the product candidate as safe and effective by patients and the medical community; and\n\u25cf a continued acceptable safety profile of a product candidate following approval.\nMany of these factors are beyond ESSA\u2019s control. If ESSA, or its potential commercialization collaborators, are unable to successfully commercialize a product candidate, ESSA may not be able to earn sufficient revenues to continue the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s product candidate and potential future product candidates may have undesirable side effects that may delay or prevent marketing approval or, if approval is received, require them to be taken off the market, require them to include safety warnings or otherwise limit their sales.\nAlthough any future product candidates will undergo safety testing, not all adverse effects of drugs can be predicted or anticipated. Unforeseen side effects from any of ESSA\u2019s product candidate and potential future product candidates could arise either during clinical development or, if approved by regulatory authorities, after the approved product has been marketed. The results of any future clinical trials may show that the product candidate(s) cause undesirable or unacceptable side effects, which could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials, and result in delay of, or failure to obtain, marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities, or result in marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities with restrictive label warnings, limited patient populations or potential product liability claims.\nIf any of ESSA\u2019s product candidate and potential future product candidates receive marketing approval and it or others later identify undesirable or unacceptable side effects caused by such products:\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may require us to take ESSA\u2019s approved product off the market;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, specific warnings, a contraindication or field alerts to physicians and pharmacies;\n\u25cf it may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical trials or change the labeling of the product;\n\u25cf it may be subject to limitations on how it may promote or distribute the product;\n\u25cf sales of the product may decrease significantly;\n\u25cf it may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n\u25cf ESSA\u2019s reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent ESSA or its future collaborative partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent ESSA from generating significant revenue from the sale of ESSA\u2019s products.\nIf ESSA is unable to enroll subjects in clinical trials, ESSA will be unable to complete these trials on a timely basis.\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors including the size and nature of the patient population, the impact of Covid-19, the proximity of subjects to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, ability to obtain and maintain patient consents, risk that enrolled subjects will drop out before completion, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications ESSA is investigating. Furthermore, ESSA plans to rely on clinical research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of the Company\u2019s clinical trials, and while the Company has agreements governing their committed activities, the Company has limited influence over their actual performance.\nIf ESSA experiences delays in the completion or termination of any clinical trial of any future product candidates, the commercial prospects of product candidates will be harmed, and ESSA\u2019s ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed. In addition, any delays in completing ESSA\u2019s clinical trials will increase costs, slow down product candidate development and approval process and could shorten any periods during which ESSA may have the exclusive right to commercialize product candidates or allow competitors to bring products to market before ESSA does, and jeopardize ESSA\u2019s ability to commence product sales, which would impair ESSA\u2019s ability to generate revenues and may harm ESSA\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and future prospects. In addition, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of ESSA\u2019s proposed products or future product candidates.\nESSA may conduct trials for future product candidates at sites outside the United States and the FDA may not accept data from trials conducted in such locations.\nESSA may in the future choose to conduct more clinical trials outside the United States. Although the FDA may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States, acceptance of this data is subject to certain conditions imposed by the FDA. For example, the clinical trial must be well designed and conducted and performed by qualified investigators in accordance with ethical principles. The trial population must also adequately represent the U.S. population, and the data must be applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice in ways that the FDA deems clinically meaningful. In addition, while these clinical trials are subject to the applicable local laws, FDA acceptance of the data will be dependent upon its determination that the studies also complied with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations. There can be no assurance the FDA will accept data from trials conducted outside of the United States. If the FDA chooses to not accept data collected outside the United States, it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay or permanently halt the development of the Company\u2019s proposed products or any future product candidates.\nEven if the Company obtains marketing approval for any product candidate and potential future products, the Company will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense.\nEven if the Company obtains U.S., Canadian or European regulatory approval for a future product candidate, which would not occur until the Company successfully completes multiple clinical trials, including Phase III clinical trials, the FDA, TPD or EMA may still impose significant restrictions on its indicated uses or marketing or the conditions of approval, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly and time-consuming post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials or clinical outcome studies and post-market surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of ESSA\u2019s potential products. Even if the Company secures U.S., Canadian or European regulatory approval, the Company would continue to be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements governing manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, quality assurance, distribution, import, export, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of adverse events and other post-market information. These requirements include registration with the FDA, as well as continued compliance with GCP obligations, for any clinical trials that the Company conducts post approval. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current cGMP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents.\nWith respect to any product candidates for which ESSA obtains regulatory approval, ESSA will be subject to post-marketing regulatory obligations, including the requirements by the FDA, EMA and similar agencies in other jurisdictions to maintain records regarding product safety and to report to regulatory authorities serious or unexpected adverse events. Compliance with extensive post-marketing record keeping and reporting requirements requires a significant commitment of time and funds, which may limit ESSA\u2019s ability to successfully commercialize approved products.\nIn addition, manufacturing of approved drug products must comply with extensive regulations governing cGMP. Manufacturers and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections. As ESSA will be dependent on third parties for manufacturing, ESSA will have limited ability to ensure that any entity manufacturing products on its behalf is doing so in compliance with applicable cGMP requirements. Failure or delay by any manufacturer of ESSA\u2019s products to comply with cGMP regulations or to satisfy regulatory inspections could have a material adverse effect on ESSA, including potentially preventing ESSA from being able to supply products for clinical trials or commercial sales. In addition, manufacturers may need to obtain approval from regulatory authorities for product, manufacturing, or labeling changes, which requires time and money to obtain and can cause delays in product availability. ESSA is also required to comply with good distribution practices such as maintenance of storage and shipping conditions, as well as security of products, in order to ensure product quality determined by cGMP is maintained throughout the distribution network. In addition, ESSA is subject to regulations governing the import and export of its products.\nSales and marketing of pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive federal and state or other laws governing on-label and off-label advertising, scientific/educational grants, gifts, consulting and pricing and are also subject to consumer protection and unfair competition laws. Compliance with these extensive regulatory requirements will require training and monitoring of any future sales force, which will impose a substantial cost on ESSA and ESSA\u2019s collaborators. To the extent any future ESSA products are marketed by collaborators, ESSA\u2019s ability to ensure their compliance with applicable regulations will be limited.\nFailure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial sanctions.\nIf the Company or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, lack of efficacy, problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or the Company or its manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the Company may be subject to the following administrative or judicial sanctions:\n\u25cf restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u25cf issuance of warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u25cf clinical holds;\n\u25cf injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u25cf suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval;\n\u25cf suspension of any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u25cf refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by the Company, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\u25cf suspension or imposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements;\n\u25cf withdrawal of the product from the market and product recalls; or\n\u25cf product seizure or detention or refusal to permit the import or export of product.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit the Company\u2019s ability to commercialize potential products and generate revenue. Adverse regulatory action, whether pre- or post-approval, can also potentially lead to product liability claims and increase the Company\u2019s product liability exposure.\nIn the future, the regulatory climate might change due to changes in the FDA and other regulatory authorities\u2019 staffing, policies or regulations and such changes could impose additional post-marketing obligations or restrictions and related costs. While it is impossible to predict future legislative or administrative action, if the Company is not able to maintain regulatory compliance, the Company will not be able to market its drugs and its business could suffer.\nIf clinical trials for ESSA\u2019s product candidate and potential future product candidates are prolonged, delayed or stopped, ESSA may be unable to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize such product candidates on a timely basis, or at all, which would require ESSA to incur additional costs and delay receipt of any product revenue.\nESSA may experience delays in any future preclinical studies or clinical trials, and ESSA does not know whether future preclinical studies or clinical trials will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll an adequate number of patients on time or be completed on schedule, if at all. The commencement of these planned clinical trials could be substantially delayed or prevented by several factors, including:\n\u25cf discussions with the FDA or other regulatory agencies regarding the scope or design of ESSA\u2019s clinical trials;\n\u25cf the limited number of, and competition for, suitable sites to conduct ESSA\u2019s clinical trials, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical trial programs, including some that may be for the same indication as ESSA\u2019s product candidates;\n\u25cf any delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval or agreement to commence a clinical trial in any of the countries where enrollment is planned;\n\u25cf inability to obtain sufficient funds required for a clinical trial;\n\u25cf clinical holds on, or other regulatory objections to, a new or ongoing clinical trial;\n\u25cf delay or failure to manufacture sufficient supplies of the product candidate for ESSA\u2019s clinical trials;\n\u25cf delay or failure to reach agreement on acceptable clinical trial agreement terms or clinical trial protocols with prospective sites or CROs, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different sites or CROs; and\n\u25cf delay or failure to obtain institutional review board (\u201cIRB\u201d), approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site.\nThe completion of ESSA\u2019s clinical trials, once started, could also be substantially delayed or prevented by several factors, including:\n\u25cf slower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment;\n\u25cf failure of patients to complete the clinical trial;\n\u25cf the inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients in studies to ensure adequate statistical power to detect statistically significant treatment effects;\n\u25cf unforeseen safety issues, including severe or unexpected drug-related adverse effects experienced by patients, including possible deaths;\n\u25cf lack of efficacy during clinical trials;\n\u25cf termination of ESSA\u2019s clinical trials by one or more clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf inability or unwillingness of patients or clinical investigators to follow ESSA\u2019s clinical trial protocols;\n\u25cf inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment by ESSA and/or ESSA\u2019s CROs;\n\u25cf ESSA\u2019s CROs or clinical study sites failing to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to ESSA in a timely manner, or at all, deviating from the protocol or dropping out of a study;\n\u25cf the inability to produce or obtain sufficient quantities of the product candidate to complete clinical studies;\n\u25cf the inability to scale up manufacture of the product candidate into a commercially acceptable formulation at reasonable cost;\n\u25cf the inability to address any noncompliance with regulatory requirements or safety concerns that arise during the course of a clinical trial; and\n\u25cf the need to repeat or terminate clinical trials as a result of inconclusive or negative results or unforeseen complications in testing.\nChanges in regulatory requirements, policies and guidelines may also occur and ESSA may need to significantly amend clinical trial protocols to reflect these changes with appropriate regulatory authorities. Such changes may require ESSA to renegotiate terms with CROs or resubmit clinical trial protocols to IRBs for re-examination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of a clinical trial. ESSA\u2019s clinical trials may be suspended or terminated at any time by the FDA, other regulatory authorities, the IRB overseeing the clinical trial at issue, any of ESSA\u2019s clinical trial sites with respect to that site, or ESSA, due to a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or ESSA\u2019s clinical protocols;\n\u25cf unforeseen safety issues or any determination that a clinical trial presents unacceptable health risks;\n\u25cf lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial due to unforeseen costs or other business decisions; and\n\u25cf upon a breach or pursuant to the terms of any agreement with, or for any other reason by, current or future collaborators that have responsibility for the clinical development of any of ESSA\u2019s product candidates.\nProduct development costs for any of ESSA\u2019s potential products will increase if it has delays in testing or approval or if the Company needs to perform more or larger clinical studies than planned. Any delays in completing the Company\u2019s future clinical trials will increase its costs, slow down its development and approval process and jeopardize its ability to generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and prospects.\nESSA relies on third parties to conduct its preclinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, this could substantially harm ESSA\u2019s business because it may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize product candidates in a timely manner or at all.\nESSA has extensively relied upon and plans to continue to extensively rely upon entities outside of its control, including CROS and academic institutions, to monitor and manage data for its ongoing preclinical and clinical programs. ESSA relies on these parties for execution of its preclinical studies and clinical trials, and it controls only some aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, ESSA is responsible for ensuring that each of its studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and ESSA\u2019s reliance on CROS and academic institutions does not relieve it of these responsibilities. ESSA also relies on third parties to assist in conducting its preclinical studies in accordance with GLP and the Animal Welfare Act requirements. ESSA and the third parties that it relies on are required to comply with federal regulations and current GCP, which are international standards meant to protect the rights and health of patients that are enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of ESSA\u2019s products in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce GCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If ESSA or any of the third parties it relies on fail to comply with applicable GCP, the clinical data generated in ESSA\u2019s clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require ESSA to perform additional clinical trials before approving ESSA\u2019s marketing applications. ESSA cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of its clinical trials comply with GCP requirements. In addition, ESSA\u2019s clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP requirements. Failure to comply with these regulations may require ESSA to repeat preclinical studies and clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nThe third parties that ESSA relies upon are not its employees, and except for remedies available to the Company under its agreements with such third parties, ESSA cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to the Company\u2019s ongoing clinical, nonclinical and preclinical programs. Academic institutions may not operate under the same commercial standards as other third-party CROs that undertake such work and may not be able to devote adequate time and resources to preclinical studies. If CROs or academic institutions do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the preclinical or clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, ESSA\u2019s preclinical or clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize future product candidates. As a result, ESSA\u2019s results of operations and the commercial prospects for its future product candidates would be harmed, its costs could increase and its ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nBecause ESSA has relied on third parties, its internal capacity to perform these functions is limited. Outsourcing these functions involves risk that third parties may not perform to ESSA\u2019s standards, may not produce results in a timely manner or may fail to perform at all. In addition, the use of third-party service providers requires ESSA to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that this information will be misappropriated. ESSA currently has a small number of employees, which limits the internal resources we have available to identify and monitor third-party providers. To the extent ESSA is unable to identify and successfully manage the performance of third-party service providers in the future, its business may be adversely affected. Though ESSA carefully manages its relationships with CROs and academic institutions, there can be no assurance that it will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on ESSA\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and future prospects.\nIf ESSA\u2019s relationships with CROs or academic institutions terminate, its drug development efforts could be delayed.\nESSA relies on entities outside of its control, including CROs and academic institutions, for preclinical studies and clinical trials related to its drug development efforts. Switching or adding additional CROs or academic institutions would involve additional cost and would require management time and focus. The CROs and academic institutions that ESSA relies on have the right to terminate their agreements with the Company in the event of an uncured material breach. If any of ESSA\u2019s relationships with CROs and academic institutions terminate, the Company could experience a significant delay in identifying, qualifying and managing performance of a comparable third-party service provider, which could adversely affect its development programs. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO or academic institution commences work and the new CRO or academic institution may not provide the same type or level of services as the original provider. ESSA may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or academic institutions or be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms.\nESSA has limited experience manufacturing product candidates on a large clinical or commercial scale and has no manufacturing facility. As a result, ESSA may in the future be dependent on third party manufacturers for the manufacture of product candidates as well as on third parties for ESSA\u2019s supply chain, and if ESSA experiences problems with any future third parties, the manufacturing of ESSA\u2019s product candidates or products could be delayed.\nESSA does not own or operate facilities for the manufacture of future potential product candidates. ESSA currently has no plans to build internal clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. As a result, ESSA potentially may rely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, in the future, for the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients for ESSA\u2019s potential products. Also, ESSA may potentially rely on another contract manufacturing organization for the production of the final product formulation. To meet ESSA\u2019s projected potential needs for clinical supplies to support its activities through regulatory approval and commercial manufacturing, the contract manufacturing organizations with whom ESSA may potentially work will need to increase the scale of production. ESSA may need to identify additional contract manufacturing organizations for continued production of supply for product candidates in the event the current potential contract manufacturing organizations ESSA chooses to utilize are unable to scale production, or if ESSA otherwise experiences any problems with them. Although alternative third-party suppliers with the necessary manufacturing and regulatory expertise and facilities exist, it could be expensive and take a significant amount of time to arrange for alternative suppliers. ESSA may encounter technical difficulties or delays in the transfer of any future potential product manufacturing on a commercial scale to additional third-party manufacturers. ESSA may be unable to enter into agreements for commercial supply with third-party manufacturers, or may be unable to do so on acceptable terms. If ESSA is unable to arrange for alternative third-party manufacturing sources or to do so on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, ESSA may not be able to complete development of its potential product candidates, market or distribute them.\nReliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which ESSA would not be subject if ESSA manufactured product candidates or products ourselves, including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party because of factors beyond ESSA\u2019s control, including a failure to synthesize and manufacture product candidates or any products ESSA may eventually commercialize in accordance with ESSA\u2019s specifications and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time that is costly or damaging to ESSA. In addition, the FDA and other regulatory authorities require that ESSA\u2019s product candidates and any products that ESSA may eventually commercialize be manufactured according to cGMP and similar foreign standards. Any failure by ESSA\u2019s third-party manufacturers to comply with cGMP or failure to scale up manufacturing processes, including any failure to deliver sufficient quantities of product candidates in a timely manner, could lead to a delay in, or failure to obtain, regulatory approval of any of ESSA\u2019s potential product candidates and could cause ESSA to incur higher costs and prevent ESSA from commercializing product candidates successfully. In addition, such failure could be the basis for the FDA to issue a warning letter, withdraw approvals for product candidates previously granted to ESSA, or take other regulatory or legal action, including recall or seizure of outside supplies of the product candidate, total or partial suspension of production, suspension of ongoing clinical trials, refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, detention or product, refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunction, or imposing civil and criminal penalties.\nAny significant disruption in ESSA\u2019s supplier relationships could harm the Company\u2019s business. Any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate or its key materials for a potential ongoing clinical study could considerably delay completion of ESSA\u2019s potential clinical trials, product testing and regulatory approval of ESSA\u2019s potential product candidates. If ESSA\u2019s manufacturers or ESSA is unable to purchase these key materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for ESSA\u2019s product candidates, the commercial launch of ESSA\u2019s product candidates would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, which would impair ESSA\u2019s ability to generate revenues from the sale of its product candidates. It may take several years to establish an alternative source of supply for ESSA\u2019s product candidates and to have any such new source approved by the FDA.\nFailure to obtain regulatory approval in international jurisdictions would prevent any product candidates from being marketed outside the United States.\nIn order to market and sell ESSA\u2019s products in the European Union and many other jurisdictions, it must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside of the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. Obtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for ESSA and could delay or prevent the introduction of its potential products in certain countries. ESSA may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. A failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. ESSA may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize its potential products in any market. If ESSA is unable to obtain approval of any of its future product candidates by regulatory authorities in the European Union or another jurisdiction, the commercial prospects of that product candidate may be significantly diminished and its business prospects could decline.\nRecently enacted and future legislation in the United States may increase the difficulty and cost for the Company to obtain marketing approval of, and commercialize, its products and affect the prices the Company may obtain.\nIn the United States, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval for ESSA\u2019s products, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect the Company\u2019s ability to profitably sell products. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. The Company does not know whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of ESSA\u2019s products, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject the Company to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nIn recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered reductions in Medicare reimbursement levels for drugs administered by physicians. CMS also has authority to revise Medicare reimbursement rates and to implement Medicare coverage restrictions for some drugs. Cost reduction initiatives and changes in coverage implemented through legislation or regulation could decrease utilization of and reimbursement for any approved products, which in turn would affect the price ESSA can receive for those products, if approved. While Medicare regulations apply only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Therefore, any reduction in reimbursement that results from federal legislation or regulation may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nIn March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cACA\u201d) was signed into law. This law, which was intended to broaden access to health insurance, significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. Among other things, the ACA imposed an annual fee on manufacturers of branded prescription drugs, increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; expanded the healthcare fraud and abuse laws, implemented a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer discounts off negotiated prices; expanded the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; expanded the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service Act pharmaceutical pricing program; and imposed a number of substantial new compliance provisions related to pharmaceutical companies\u2019 interactions with healthcare practitioners.\nSince its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed into law by President Trump in 2017, effectively repealed the individual health insurance mandate, which is considered a key component of the ACA. In November 2020, the United States Supreme Court heard oral argument in a case regarding the constitutionality of the ACA and the individual mandate. The ongoing challenges to the ACA and new legislative proposals have resulted in uncertainty regarding the ACA\u2019s future viability and destabilization of the health care market. These reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that ESSA may successfully develop and for which ESSA may obtain marketing approval and may affect ESSA\u2019s overall financial condition and ability to develop or commercialize product candidates. For example, it is possible that efforts to repeal the ACA, if enacted into law, could ultimately result in fewer individuals having health insurance coverage or in individuals having insurance coverage with less generous benefits. The scope of potential future legislation to repeal and replace the ACA provisions is highly uncertain in many respects, as is the effect of such future legislation on ESSA\u2019s business and prospects.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. Beginning April 1, 2013, Medicare payments for all items and services, including drugs and biologics, were reduced by 2% under the sequestration (i.e., automatic spending reductions) required by the Budget Control Act of 2011. Although Medicare sequestration will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act passed in March 2020 temporarily suspended Medicare sequestration from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Separately, in January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to certain providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. New laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which may materially adversely affect future customer demand and affordability for any future our products, if approved and, accordingly, the results of our financial operations.\nFurther, the FDA\u2019s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020 the FDA announced its intention to postpone most domestic and foreign inspections of manufacturing facilities, and regulatory authorities outside the United States adopted similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the FDA resumed domestic on-site inspections in July 2021, inspections are being scheduled based upon each state's phase of reopening and the current intensity and risk of COVID-19 infections in a geographic region, and foreign inspections have not resumed. This or other decreases in FDA inspection or regulatory activity could delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. Changes to the FDA\u2019s policies and regulations may also impact our product candidates. For example, in December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (\u201cCures Act\u201d) was signed into law. The Cures Act, among other things, is intended to modernize the regulation of drugs and biologics and spur innovation, but its ultimate implementation is unclear. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability. In addition, on May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017 (\u201cRight to Try Act\u201d) was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for certain patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial and that are undergoing investigation for FDA approval. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA permission under the FDA expanded access program. There is no obligation for a drug manufacturer to make its drug products available to eligible patients as a result of the Right to Try Act. ESSA cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on its product candidates, if any, may be.\nWe also cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action in the United States. For example, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which pharmaceutical companies set and advertise prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation, as well as state efforts, designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. On July 24, 2020, President Trump announced four executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempt to implement several of the administration\u2019s proposals, including eliminating protection under an Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbor for certain retrospective price reductions provided by drug manufacturers to sponsors of Medicare Part D plans or pharmacy benefit managers that are not applied at the point-of-sale; allowing the importation of certain drugs from other countries through individual waivers, permitting the re-importation of insulin products and prioritizing finalization of FDA\u2019s December 2019 proposed rule to permit the importation of drugs from Canada; ensuring that payment by the Medicare program for certain Medicare Part B drugs is not higher than the payment by other comparable countries; and reducing the cost of insulin and epinephrine to patients of Federally Qualified Health Centers. While the scope and details of these executive orders are not clear, this continues to signal that the U.S. executive branch may pursue new measures to constrain drug costs and Medicare payments for drugs. The volume of drug pricing-related bills has dramatically increased under the recent Congresses and, among other recent proposals, Congress has proposed bills to change the Medicare Part D benefit to impose an inflation-based rebate in Medicare Part D and to alter the benefit structure to increase manufacturer contributions in the catastrophic phase. While the U.S. election cycle creates uncertainty about which, if any, measures will ultimately be enacted and their potential impacts, the U.S. Congress and executive branch may continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs.\nAt the state level, individual states in the United States are increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries, such as Canada, as well as bulk purchasing. There has also been increased discussion at the federal level, including by the Trump Administration, of proposals intended to encourage re-importation. These and other potential reforms could have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry and on the development and potential future pricing of ESSA\u2019s product candidates.\nESSA\u2019s business may be materially adversely affected by new legislation, new regulatory requirements and the continuing efforts of governmental and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare through various means.\nGovernments and regulatory authorities in Europe and other markets in which ESSA intends to sell its products may propose and adopt new legislation and regulatory requirements relating to pharmaceutical approval criteria and manufacturing requirements. Such legislation or regulatory requirements, or the failure to comply with such, could adversely impact ESSA\u2019s operations and could have a material adverse effect on ESSA\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn recent years, national, federal, provincial, state, and local officials and legislators have proposed, or are reportedly considering proposing, a variety of price-based reforms to the healthcare systems in the European Union, the United States and other countries. Some proposals include measures that would limit or eliminate payments for certain medical procedures and treatments or subject the pricing of pharmaceuticals to government control. Furthermore, in certain foreign markets, the pricing or profitability of healthcare products is subject to government controls and other measures that have been prepared by legislators and government officials. While ESSA cannot predict whether any such legislative or regulatory proposals or reforms will be adopted, the adoption of any such proposals or reforms could adversely affect the commercial viability of the Company\u2019s existing and potential products. Significant changes in the healthcare system in the European Union and other countries may have a substantial impact on the manner in which ESSA conducts its business. Such changes could also have a material adverse effect on ESSA\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to ESSA\u2019s Financial Position and Need for Additional Capital\nESSA will have significant additional future capital needs for future clinical trials and there are uncertainties as to the Company\u2019s ability to raise additional funding.\nManagement has forecasted that ESSA\u2019s working capital will be sufficient to execute its planned expenditures for the coming fiscal year. On current plans, ESSA believes it has sufficient capital resources to continue and expand its business, including the development of its preclinical Aniten series of compounds (\u201cAniten\u201d) through the conduct of the initial Phase I trial of its IND candidate EPI-7386, a subsequent initial expansion phase, and at least one initial Phase I combination trial of EPI-7386 with an anti-androgen. Advancing ESSA\u2019s novel and proprietary therapies beyond these activities or acquisition and development of any new products or product candidates would require considerable resources and additional access to capital. In addition, ESSA\u2019s future cash requirements may vary materially from those now expected. For example, ESSA\u2019s future capital requirements may increase if:\n\u25cf the Company experiences setbacks in its progress with non-clinical studies or if future clinical trials are delayed;\n\u25cf the Company is required to perform additional non-clinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u25cf the Company elects to develop, acquire or license new technologies, products or businesses;\n\u25cf the Company experiences competition from other life sciences companies or in more markets than anticipated;\n\u25cf the Company experiences delays or unexpected increases in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals in the various markets where ESSA hopes to sell its products;\n\u25cf the Company experiences unexpected or increased costs relating to preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims, or other lawsuits, brought by either ESSA or ESSA\u2019s competition; or\n\u25cf the Company experiences scientific progress sooner than expected in its discovery and R&D projects, if ESSA expands the magnitude and scope of these activities, or if ESSA changes its focus as a result of ESSA\u2019s discoveries.\nESSA could potentially seek additional funding through strategic collaborations, alliances and licensing arrangements, through public or private equity or debt financing, or through other transactions. However, if future sales are slow to increase or if capital market conditions in general, or with respect to life sciences companies such as ESSA\u2019s, are unfavorable, ESSA\u2019s ability to obtain significant additional funding on acceptable terms, if at all, will be negatively affected. There is no certainty that any such financing will be provided or provided on favorable terms.\nIf sufficient capital is not available, ESSA may be required to delay or abandon its business expansion or R&D projects, either of which could have a material adverse effect on ESSA\u2019s business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations.\nESSA may not be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms, which may result in dilution to ESSA\u2019s existing shareholders, restrictions on ESSA\u2019s operations or the requirement for ESSA to relinquish rights to technologies or any future product candidates.\nUntil the Company can generate substantial revenue from product sales, if ever, the Company expects to finance future cash needs through a combination of private and public equity offerings, debt financings, strategic collaborations and alliances and licensing arrangements. Additional financing that the Company may pursue may involve the sale of its Common Shares or financial instruments that are exchangeable for, or convertible into, its Common Shares, which could result in significant dilution to ESSA\u2019s shareholders and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of existing shareholders. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. Furthermore, these securities may have rights senior to those of ESSA\u2019s Common Shares and could contain covenants that include restrictive covenants limiting ESSA\u2019s ability to take important actions and potentially impair ESSA\u2019s competitiveness, such as limitations on ESSA\u2019s ability to incur additional debt, make capital expenditures, acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights or declare dividends. If ESSA raises additional funds through strategic collaborations and alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, ESSA may have to relinquish valuable rights to technologies or future product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to ESSA. If the Company is unable to raise additional funds when needed, the Company may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate its product development or commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that ESSA would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nThe Company remains subject to the restrictions and conditions of the CPRIT Agreement. Failure to comply with the CPRIT Agreement may materially and adversely affect ESSA\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nESSA relied on the CPRIT Grant to fund a portion of its preclinical and Phase 1 clinical development costs of clinical candidate EPI-506, which ceased development in September 2017. The total of the CPRIT Grant was US$12 million, of which ESSA has received a total of US$11.7 million to date, as follows: US$2.8 million (on grant execution), US$3.7 million (upon the clearance of the IND of EPI-506, ESSA\u2019s first-generation agent, by the FDA) and US$5.2 million (upon commencement of the Phase I clinical trial of EPI-506 in November 2015). The CPRIT Grant is subject to various requirements, including ESSA\u2019s compliance with the scope of work outlined in the CPRIT Agreement and demonstration of its progress towards achievement of the milestones set forth in the CPRIT Agreement. If ESSA fails to comply with the terms of the CPRIT Agreement, is found to have used any grant proceeds for purposes other than intended, or fails to maintain the required level of operations in the State of Texas for three years following the final payment of grant funds, CPRIT could determine that ESSA is in default of its obligations under the CPRIT Agreement and could, among other things, seek reimbursement of all proceeds of the CPRIT Grant received by ESSA. ESSA received and responded to a request in October 2018 for information from CPRIT regarding the nature and extent of the Company\u2019s operations in Texas. Although the Company believes it has at all times acted in compliance with the CPRIT Agreement and believes its response to CPRIT\u2019s request for information is satisfactory, there can be no assurance that CPRIT will agree with ESSA\u2019s determination. If ESSA is found to be in default under the CPRIT Agreement and such default is not waived by CPRIT, the Company may not receive the remaining funds of the CPRIT Grant or could be required to reimburse a portion or all of the CPRIT Grant. ESSA cannot be certain that its assets or cash flows or ability to raise additional capital will be sufficient to fully repay the CPRIT Grant. Being required to reimburse all or a portion of the CPRIT Grant would impact ESSA\u2019s ongoing operations, which could materially and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company has incurred significant losses in every quarter since its inception and anticipates that it will continue to incur significant losses in the future and may never generate profits from operations or maintain profitability.\nESSA is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. Investment in pharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate effect or an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval or become commercially viable. ESSA does not have any products approved by regulatory authorities for marketing or commercial sale and has not generated any revenue from product sales, or otherwise, to date. Furthermore, ESSA continues to incur significant research, development and other expenses related to its ongoing operations. As a result, ESSA is not profitable and has incurred losses in every reporting period since inception in 2009. For the years ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, ESSA reported net losses of $23,445,370 and $12,756,832, respectively. As of September 30, 2020, ESSA had an accumulated deficit since inception of $80,970,304.\nThe Company expects to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future. ESSA anticipates these losses will increase as it continues the research and development of, and seeks regulatory approvals for, its product candidate and any of its potential future product candidates and potentially begins to commercialize any products that may achieve regulatory approval. ESSA may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect its financial condition. The size of ESSA\u2019s future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of ESSA\u2019s expenses and ESSA\u2019s ability to generate revenues. The Company\u2019s prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition.\nEven if the Company is able to commercialize any product candidate, there can be no assurance that the Company will generate significant revenues or ever achieve profitability.\nThe Company expects to continue to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future, and these losses may be increasing. The Company is uncertain about when or if it will be able to achieve or sustain profitability. If the Company achieves profitability in the future, it may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Failure to become and remain profitable would impair the Company\u2019s ability to sustain operations and adversely affect the price of the Common Shares and its ability to raise capital.\nESSA has a limited operating history, which may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of ESSA\u2019s business to date and to assess ESSA\u2019s future viability.\nThe Company\u2019s operations in 2020 have been primarily limited to organizing and staffing ESSA, establishing relationships with consultants and contract vendors with relevant expertise, acquiring the in-licensing of intellectual property, discovering and developing novel small molecule product candidates, conducting preliminary preclinical research, preparing for the execution of a Phase I clinical study of its next-generation agent EPI-7386 and conducting a Phase I clinical study of its next-generation agent EPI-7386. ESSA is a development stage company with limited operating history and no revenue. ESSA has identified a product candidate, EPI-7386, to advance through clinical development but does not have any products ready for commercialization. Consequently, evaluating ESSA\u2019s performance, viability or future success will be more difficult than if ESSA had a longer operating history or approved products on the market.\nRisks Related to ESSA\u2019s Intellectual Property\nESSA relies on proprietary technology, the protection of which can be unpredictable and costly.\nThe Company\u2019s activities depend, in part, on its ability to (i) obtain and maintain patents, trade secret protection and operate without infringing the intellectual proprietary rights of third parties, (ii) successfully defend these patents (including patents owned by or licensed to the Company) against third-party challenges and (iii) successfully enforce these patents against third-party competitors. There is no assurance that the Company will be granted such patents or proprietary technology or that such granted patents or proprietary technology will not be circumvented through the adoption of a competitive, though non-infringing, process or product. The patent positions of pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws may diminish the value of the Company\u2019s intellectual property. Accordingly, the Company cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowable or enforceable in its patents (including patents owned by or licensed to the Company). Failure to protect the Company\u2019s existing and future intellectual property rights could seriously harm its business and prospects and may result in the loss of its ability to exclude others from using the Company\u2019s technology or its own right to use the technologies. If the Company does not adequately ensure the right to use certain technologies, it may have to pay others for the right to use their intellectual property, pay damages for infringement or misappropriation or be enjoined from using such intellectual property. The Company\u2019s patents do not guarantee the right to use the technologies if other parties own intellectual property rights that are necessary in order to use such technologies. The Company\u2019s patent position is subject to complex factual and legal issues that may give rise to uncertainty as to the validity, scope and enforceability of a particular patent. The Company\u2019s and the Company\u2019s licensors\u2019 patents and patent applications, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties. U.S. patents and patent applications may also be subject to interference proceedings, re-examination proceedings, derivation proceedings, post-grant review or inter partes review in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d), challenging the Company\u2019s or the Company\u2019s licensors\u2019 patent rights. Foreign patents may be subject also to opposition or comparable proceedings in the corresponding foreign patent office.\nIn addition, there is a risk that improved versions of ESSA\u2019s own product developed by third parties will be granted patent protection and compete with ESSA\u2019s products. For example, any patents ESSA obtains may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from utilizing its technologies or from developing competing products and technologies. Third parties may attempt to circumvent ESSA\u2019s patents by means of alternative designs and processes or may independently develop similar products, duplicate any of ESSA\u2019s products not under patent protection, or design around the inventions ESSA claims in any of its existing patents, existing patent applications or future patents or patent applications. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of ESSA\u2019s coverage, the availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patents. It is impossible to anticipate the breadth or degree of protection that patents will afford products developed by ESSA or their underlying technology.\nIn any case, there can be no assurance that:\n\u25cf any rights under U.S., Canadian, or foreign patents owned by the Company or other patents that third parties license to the Company will not be curtailed;\n\u25cf the Company was the first inventor of inventions covered by its issued patents or pending applications or that the Company was the first to file patent applications for such inventions;\n\u25cf the Company\u2019s pending or future patent applications will be issued with the breadth of claim coverage sought by the Company, or be issued at all;\n\u25cf the Company\u2019s competitors will not independently develop or patent technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the Company\u2019s technologies;\n\u25cf third parties will not attempt to circumvent ESSA\u2019s patents by means of alternative designs and processes or that third parties will not also independently develop similar products, duplicate any of ESSA\u2019s products not under patent protection, or design around the inventions ESSA claims in any of the Company\u2019s existing patents, existing patent applications or future patents or patent applications;\n\u25cf any of the Company\u2019s trade secrets will not be learned independently by its competitors; or\n\u25cf the steps the Company takes to protect its intellectual property will be adequate.\nIn addition, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not sought in certain foreign countries. Further, countries ESSA may sell to may not protect its intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States, Canada or Europe, and may lack rules and procedures required for defending ESSA\u2019s patents.\nThere is a risk that any patents issued relating to ESSA\u2019s products or any patents licensed to ESSA may be successfully challenged or that the practice of its products might infringe the patents of third parties. If the practice of ESSA\u2019s products infringes the patents of third parties, the Company may be required to design around such patents, potentially causing increased costs and delays in product development and introduction or precluding ESSA from developing, manufacturing or selling its planned products. In addition, disputes may arise as to the rights to know-how and inventions among ESSA\u2019s employees and consultants who use intellectual property owned by others for the work performed for the Company. The scope and validity of patents which may be obtained by third parties, the extent to which ESSA may wish or need to obtain patent licenses and the cost and availability of such licenses are currently unknown. If such licenses are obtained, it is likely they would be royalty bearing, which could reduce ESSA\u2019s income. If licenses cannot be obtained on an economical basis, delays in market introduction of its planned products could occur or introduction could be prevented, in some cases causing the expenditure of substantial funds.\nIn certain instances, ESSA may elect not to seek patent protection but instead rely on the protection of the Company\u2019s technology through confidentiality agreements or trade secrets. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that the Company will have adequate remedies for any breach or that such persons or institutions will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of these relationships. The value of ESSA\u2019s assets could also be reduced to the extent that third parties are able to obtain patent protection with respect to aspects of ESSA\u2019s technology or products or that confidential measures ESSA has in place to protect the Company\u2019s proprietary technology are breached or become unenforceable. However, third parties may independently develop or obtain similar technology and such third parties may be able to market competing products and obtain regulatory approval through a showing of equivalency to one of ESSA\u2019s products which has obtained regulatory approval, without being required to undertake the same lengthy and expensive clinical studies that ESSA would have already completed. The cost of enforcing the Company\u2019s patent rights or defending rights against infringement charges by other patent holders may be significant and could limit operations.\nLitigation may also be necessary to enforce patents issued or licensed to ESSA or to determine the scope and validity of a third party\u2019s proprietary rights. ESSA could incur substantial costs if the Company is required to defend itself in patent suits brought by third parties, if ESSA participates in patent suits brought against or initiated by ESSA\u2019s corporate collaborators or if ESSA initiates such suits. The Company may not have the necessary resources to participate in or defend any such activities or litigation. Even if ESSA did have the resources to vigorously pursue its interests in litigation, because of the complexity of the subject matter, it is impossible to predict whether ESSA would prevail in any such action. Any claims of patent infringement asserted by third parties may:\n\u25cf divert the time and attention of the Company\u2019s technical personnel and management;\n\u25cf cause product development or commercialization delays;\n\u25cf require the Company to cease or modify its use of the technology and/or develop non-infringing technology; or\n\u25cf require the Company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.\nAn adverse outcome in litigation, or interference or derivation proceeding to determine priority or other proceeding in a court or patent or selling office could subject ESSA to significant liabilities, require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require ESSA to cease using certain technology or products, any of which may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nESSA may not be able to protect its intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on ESSA\u2019s product candidate and potential future product candidates throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States or federal and provincial laws in Canada. Consequently, ESSA may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing its inventions in all countries outside the United States or Canada, or from selling or importing products made using its inventions in and into the United States, Canada or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use ESSA\u2019s technologies in jurisdictions where it has not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may export otherwise infringing products to territories where ESSA has patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States or Canada. These products may compete with ESSA\u2019s products in jurisdictions where it does not have any issued patents and its patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from so competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for ESSA to stop the infringement of its patents or marketing of competing products in violation of its proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce ESSA\u2019s patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial cost and divert its efforts and attention from other aspects of its business. ESSA may not prevail in any lawsuits that it initiates and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful.\nThe requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. For example, unlike other countries, China has a heightened requirement for patentability, and specifically requires a detailed description of medical uses of a claimed drug. In India, unlike the United States, there is no link between regulatory approval of a drug and its patent status. Furthermore, generic or biosimilar drug manufacturers or other competitors may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of ESSA\u2019s patents, requiring it to engage in complex, lengthy and costly litigation or other proceedings. Generic or biosimilar drug manufacturers may develop, seek approval for, and launch biosimilar versions of ESSA\u2019s products. In addition to India, certain countries in Europe and developing countries, including China, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, ESSA may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if it is compelled to grant a license to a third-party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit ESSA\u2019s potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, ESSA\u2019s efforts to enforce intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that it owns or licenses.\nESSA may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that ESSA, or ESSA\u2019s employees or consultants have misappropriated their intellectual property, or claiming ownership of what ESSA regards as its own intellectual property.\nCertain of ESSA\u2019s current or former employees or consultants, including senior management, were previously employed, or continue to be employed, at universities or other public institutions, or at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including ESSA\u2019s competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees, executed proprietary rights, nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements, in connection with such previous employment. ESSA may be subject to claims that ESSA, or these employees, have used or disclosed confidential information or intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. If ESSA fails in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, ESSA may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel or sustain damages. Such intellectual property rights could be awarded to a third-party, and ESSA could be required to obtain a license from such third-party to commercialize ESSA\u2019s technology or products. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if ESSA is successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nObtaining and maintaining ESSA\u2019s patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submissions, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and its patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance and annuity fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and other foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If ESSA or its future potential licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering product candidates, ESSA\u2019s competitive position would be adversely affected.\nOther Risks Related to ESSA\u2019s Business\nThe Company\u2019s business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures or security breaches.\nIn the ordinary course of ESSA\u2019s business, the Company collects, stores and transmits confidential information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information. Despite the implementation of security measures, ESSA\u2019s internal computer systems, and those of other third parties on which the Company relies, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, cyberattacks, natural disasters, fire, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Cyberattacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity. Cyberattacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Significant disruptions of ESSA\u2019s information technology systems or security breaches could adversely affect ESSA\u2019s business operations and/or result in the loss, misappropriation, and/or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, confidential information (including trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information and personal information), and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to the Company. If such disruptions were to occur and cause interruptions in ESSA\u2019s operations, it could result in a material disruption of ESSA\u2019s drug development program. For example, the loss of preclinical study or clinical trial data from completed, ongoing or planned preclinical studies or clinical trials could result in delays in ESSA\u2019s efforts to identify and develop product candidates and significantly increase its costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss of, or damage to, ESSA\u2019s data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, the Company could incur liability and the further development of EPI compounds or the Company\u2019s product candidates could be delayed.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm ESSA\u2019s future revenues and financial condition and increase costs and expenses.\nESSA\u2019s operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which ESSA is predominantly self-insured. ESSA does not carry insurance for all categories of risk that ESSA\u2019s business may encounter. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm ESSA\u2019s operations and financial condition and increase costs and expenses. Further, any significant uninsured liability may require ESSA to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect ESSA\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows from future prospects.\nESSA\u2019s business depends heavily on the use of information technologies.\nSeveral key areas of ESSA\u2019s business depend on the use of information technologies. Despite ESSA\u2019s best efforts to prevent such behavior, third parties may nonetheless attempt to hack into ESSA\u2019s systems and obtain data relating to ESSA\u2019s preclinical studies or proprietary information on potential products. If ESSA fails to maintain or protect ESSA\u2019s information systems and data integrity effectively, ESSA could lose or have difficulty attracting customers, have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, experience increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues, or suffer other adverse consequences as a result of a data privacy breach. While ESSA has invested in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that ESSA\u2019s efforts, or those of ESSA\u2019s third-party collaborators, if any, to implement adequate security and quality control measures for data processing would be sufficient to protect against data deterioration or loss in the event of a system malfunction, or to prevent data from being stolen or corrupted in the event of a security breach. Any such loss or breach could have a material adverse effect on ESSA\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf the Company is not successful in attracting and retaining highly qualified personnel, the Company may not be able to successfully implement its business strategy.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete in the highly competitive pharmaceuticals industry depends in large part upon its ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific and medical personnel. Competition affects the Company\u2019s ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms. The Company is highly dependent on its management, scientific and medical personnel. The Company\u2019s management team has substantial knowledge in many different aspects of drug development and commercialization. Despite the Company\u2019s efforts to retain valuable employees, members of its management, scientific and medical teams may terminate their employment with the Company on short notice or, potentially, without any notice at all. The loss of the services of any of the Company\u2019s executive officers or other key employees could potentially harm its business, operating results or financial condition. The Company\u2019s success may also depend on its ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled junior, mid-level, and senior managers and scientific personnel. Other pharmaceutical companies with which the Company competes for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles, and a longer history in the industry than the Company does. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high-quality candidates than what the Company has to offer. If the Company is unable to continue to attract and retain high-quality personnel, the rate and success at which the Company can develop and commercialize product candidates would be limited.\nThird-party coverage and reimbursement and health care cost containment initiatives and treatment guidelines may constrain the Company\u2019s future revenues.\nIn many of the markets ESSA hopes to sell future products in, successful commercialization of any product candidate will depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for such product candidates and related treatments will be available from government healthcare programs, private health insurers, managed care plans and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. However, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors in the United States.\nTherefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require ESSA to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of ESSA\u2019s products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.\nA primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. ESSA cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product candidates that it or any future collaborator commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, the level of reimbursement. In addition, coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which ESSA or a collaborator obtains marketing approval. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, ESSA or its collaborators may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate for which marketing approval is obtained.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the TPD, FDA or other regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers ESSA\u2019s costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution expenses. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also be insufficient to cover ESSA\u2019s and any collaborator\u2019s costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payers and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. ESSA\u2019s or any collaborator\u2019s inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable payment rates from both government-funded and private payers for any approved products that ESSA or its collaborators develop could have a material adverse effect on ESSA\u2019s operating results, ability to raise capital needed to commercialize product candidates and overall financial condition.\nThe directors and officers of ESSA may be subject to conflicts of interest.\nSome of the directors and officers are engaged and will continue to be engaged in the search for additional business opportunities on behalf of other corporations and situations may arise where these directors and officers will be in direct competition with the Company. Not all of the Company\u2019s directors or officers are subject to non-competition agreements. Some of the directors and officers of the Company are or may become directors or officers of the other companies engaged in other business ventures whose operations may, from time to time, be in direct competition with ESSA\u2019s operations. Conflicts, if any, will be dealt with in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) and under the Company\u2019s articles of incorporation.\nThe Company faces intense competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and its operating results will suffer if the Company fails to compete effectively.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. The Company\u2019s potential competitors in the United States and globally include large, well-established pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical sales and marketing companies and specialized cancer treatment companies. Many companies, as well as research organizations, currently engage in, or have in the past engaged in, efforts related to the development of products in the same therapeutic areas as ESSA does. Due to the size of the prostate cancer treatment market and the large unmet medical need for products that treat CRPC, a number of the world\u2019s largest pharmaceutical companies are developing, or could potentially develop, products that could compete with the Company\u2019s future product candidates.\nMany of the companies developing competing technologies and products in ESSA\u2019s field have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in discovery, R&D, manufacturing, preclinical studies and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing than ESSA does. Other smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to ESSA\u2019s. There is a risk that one or more of ESSA\u2019s competitors may develop more effective or more affordable products and that such competitors will commercialize products that will render its product candidates obsolete. ESSA faces competition with respect to product efficacy and safety, ease of use and adaptability to various modes of administration, acceptance by physicians, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, availability of resources, reimbursement coverage, price and patent positions of others. In addition, these companies and institutions also compete with ESSA in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel. If the Company is not able to compete effectively against its current and future competitors, its business will not grow and its financial condition and operations will suffer materially adverse effects.\nThe Company may face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates.\nESSA\u2019s business may expand internationally and as a result, a significant portion of its revenues, expenses, current assets and current liabilities may be preliminary denominated in foreign currencies, while its financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars. A decrease in the value of such foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could result in losses in revenues from currency exchange rate fluctuations. To date, ESSA has not hedged against risks associated with foreign exchange rate exposure. ESSA cannot be sure that any hedging techniques it may implement in the future will be successful or that its business, financial condition, and results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations.\nIf ESSA is not able to convince public payors and hospitals to include ESSA\u2019s products on their approved formulary lists, revenues may not meet expectations and ESSA\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nHospitals establish formularies, which are lists of drugs approved for use in the hospital. If a drug is not included on the hospital\u2019s formulary, the ability to promote and sell ESSA\u2019s products may be limited or denied. If ESSA fails to secure and maintain formulary inclusion for products on favorable terms or are significantly delayed in doing so, ESSA may have difficulty achieving market acceptance of products and ESSA\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company has never marketed a drug before, and if the Company is unable to establish an effective sales force and marketing infrastructure, or enter into acceptable third-party sales and marketing or licensing arrangements, the Company may be unable to generate any revenue.\nESSA does not currently have an infrastructure for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical drug products and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an infrastructure may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so. In order to market any products that may be approved by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, ESSA must build its sales, marketing, managerial and other nontechnical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. If ESSA is unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, whether independently or with third parties, ESSA may not be able to generate product revenue and may not become profitable. ESSA will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded sales and marketing operations. Without an internal commercial organization or the support of a third party to perform sales and marketing functions, ESSA may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\nIn order to establish the Company\u2019s sales and marketing infrastructure, the Company will need to expand the size of its organization and the Company may experience difficulties in managing this growth.\nAs the Company\u2019s development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, the Company expects that it will need to expand the size of its employee base for managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial and other resources.\nFuture growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees. In addition, the Company\u2019s management may have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from the Company\u2019s day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. The Company\u2019s future financial performance and its ability to commercialize its potential products and any other future product candidates and its ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to effectively manage any future growth.\nESSA\u2019s product candidate and potential future products may, if approved for sale, not achieve or maintain expected levels of market acceptance, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations and could cause the market value of its securities to decline.\nEven if ESSA is able to obtain regulatory approvals for its product candidates, the success of those products is dependent upon achieving and maintaining market acceptance. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited or no commercial success. Levels of market acceptance for ESSA\u2019s products could be impacted by several factors, many of which are not within ESSA\u2019s control, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf demonstration of clinical safety and efficacy of ESSA\u2019s potential products and other possible AR-NTD inhibitors generally;\n\u25cf safety, efficacy, convenience and cost-effectiveness of ESSA\u2019s products compared to products of its competitors;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects;\n\u25cf scope of approved uses and marketing approval;\n\u25cf limitations or warnings contained in FDA-approved labeling;\n\u25cf timing of market approvals and market entry;\n\u25cf the willingness of physicians to prescribe ESSA\u2019s potential products and of the target patient population to try new therapies;\n\u25cf the inclusion of AR-NTD inhibitor products in applicable treatment guidelines;\n\u25cf new procedures or methods of treatment that may reduce the incidences of any of the indications for which ESSA\u2019s potential products shows utility;\n\u25cf difficulty in, or excessive costs to, manufacture;\n\u25cf infringement or alleged infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others;\n\u25cf the introduction of any new products, including generic AR-NTD inhibitor products, that may in the future become available to treat indications for which ESSA\u2019s potential product may be approved;\n\u25cf availability of alternative products from ESSA\u2019s competitors;\n\u25cf acceptance of the price of ESSA\u2019s products; and\n\u25cf ability to market ESSA\u2019s products effectively at the retail level.\nIn addition, the success of any new product will depend on ESSA\u2019s ability to either successfully build its in-house sales capabilities or to secure new, or to realize the benefits of existing arrangements with third-party marketing or distribution partners. Seeking out, evaluating and negotiating marketing or distribution agreements may involve the commitment of substantial time and effort and may not ultimately result in an agreement. In addition, the third-party marketing or distribution partners may not be as successful in promoting ESSA\u2019s products as it had anticipated. If ESSA is unable to commercialize new products successfully, whether through a failure to achieve market acceptance, a failure to build its own in-house sales capabilities, a failure to secure new marketing partners or to realize the benefits of ESSA\u2019s arrangements with existing marketing partners, there may be a material adverse effect on ESSA\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations and it could cause the market value of ESSA\u2019s securities to decline.\nIn addition, by the time any products are ready to be commercialized, what ESSA believes to be the market for these products may have changed. The Company\u2019s estimates of the number of patients who have received or might have been candidates to use a specific product may not accurately reflect the true market or market prices for such products or the extent to which such products, if successfully developed, will actually be used by patients. ESSA\u2019s failure to successfully introduce and market its products that are under development would have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company may acquire businesses or products or form strategic alliances in the future and the Company may not realize the benefits of such acquisitions.\nThe Company may acquire additional businesses or products, form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that the Company believes will complement or augment its existing business.\nIf the Company acquires businesses in the future, it may not be able to realize the benefit of acquiring such businesses if the Company is unable to successfully integrate them with its existing operations and company culture. The Company may encounter numerous difficulties in developing, manufacturing and marketing any new products resulting from a strategic alliance or acquisition that delay or prevent the Company from realizing their expected benefits. The potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges with respect to intellectual property, product quality, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, taxes, corporate governance and internal controls, regulatory compliance, employee, customer or partner disputes or issues and other legal and financial contingencies could decrease or eliminate the anticipated benefits and synergies of any acquisition and could negatively affect ESSA\u2019s future business and financial results.\nAs part of ESSA\u2019s business strategy, it may also continue to acquire additional companies, products or technologies principally related to, or complementary to, ESSA\u2019s current operations. Any such acquisitions will be accompanied by certain risks including but not limited to:\n\u25cf exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the unknown issues with any associated technologies or research;\n\u25cf higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses;\n\u25cf the difficulty and expense of integrating operations, systems and personnel of acquired companies;\n\u25cf disruption of ESSA\u2019s ongoing business;\n\u25cf inability to retain key customers, distributors, vendors and other business partners of the acquired company;\n\u25cf diversion of management\u2019s time and attention; and\n\u25cf possible dilution to shareholders.\nAlso, the anticipated benefit of any joint venture or acquisition may not materialize or such strategic alliance, joint venture or acquisition may be prohibited. Additionally, future acquisitions or dispositions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of ESSA\u2019s equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm ESSA\u2019s financial condition. ESSA cannot predict the number, timing or size of future joint ventures or acquisitions, or the effect that any such transactions might have on its operating results.\nESSA may not be able to successfully overcome these risks and other problems associated with acquisitions and this may adversely affect ESSA\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nESSA may seek to enter into collaborations with third parties for the development and commercialization of its product candidate and potential future product candidates. If ESSA fails to enter into such collaborations, or such collaborations are not successful, it may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of its product candidate and potential future product candidates.\nThe Company may seek third-party collaborators for development and commercialization of its product candidate and potential future product candidates. ESSA is not currently party to any such arrangement. However, if ESSA does enter into any such arrangements with any third parties in the future, it will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that its collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of ESSA\u2019s product candidates. The Company\u2019s ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend on its collaborators\u2019 abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nCollaborations involving ESSA\u2019s product candidates would pose the following risks:\n\u25cf collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u25cf collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of ESSA\u2019s product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization programs based on clinical trial results, changes in the collaborators\u2019 strategic focus or available funding, or external factors such as an acquisition that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u25cf collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u25cf collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with ESSA\u2019s products or product candidates if the collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ESSA\u2019s;\n\u25cf collaborators with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of ESSA\u2019s products may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of such product or products;\n\u25cf collaborators may not properly maintain or defend ESSA\u2019s intellectual property rights or may use ESSA\u2019s proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate ESSA\u2019s intellectual property or proprietary information or expose ESSA to potential litigation;\n\u25cf collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose ESSA to litigation and potential liability;\n\u25cf disputes may arise between the collaborators and ESSA that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of ESSA\u2019s products or product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources; and\n\u25cf collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates.\nCollaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. If a collaborator of ESSA\u2019s were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on ESSA\u2019s product development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\nESSA\u2019s employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could cause significant liability for ESSA and harm ESSA\u2019s reputation.\nESSA is exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct, including intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations of comparable foreign regulatory authorities, provide accurate information to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, comply with manufacturing standards ESSA has established, comply with federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations and similar laws and regulations established and enforced by comparable foreign regulatory authorities, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to ESSA. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to ESSA\u2019s reputation. If any such actions are instituted against ESSA and ESSA is not successful in defending itself or asserting ESSA\u2019s rights, those actions could have a significant impact on ESSA\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows from future prospects, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against the Company, it may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to cease the sale, marketing and distribution of its product candidate and potential future products.\nThe Company could face a potential risk of product liability as a result of its potential sales, marketing and distribution activities relating to any future commercialization of any future product. For example, the Company may be sued if any product it develops allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under U.S. state or Canadian provincial or other foreign consumer protection legislation. If the Company cannot successfully defend itself against product liability claims, it may incur substantial liabilities or be required to cease the sale, marketing and distribution of its products. Even successful defense against product liability claims would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf decreased demand for any future products that the Company may develop;\n\u25cf injury to the Company\u2019s reputation;\n\u25cf withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u25cf a diversion of management\u2019s time and the Company\u2019s resources;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to consumers, trial participants or patients;\n\u25cf product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u25cf loss of revenue;\n\u25cf the inability to commercialize;\n\u25cf the inability to continue the sale, marketing and distribution of ESSA\u2019s product candidate and potential future products; and\n\u25cf a decline in the price of the Common Shares or other outstanding securities.\nThe Company currently maintains insurance that it believes has sufficient coverage to protect against the liability risks discussed above and the Company believes this coverage is consistent with industry norms for companies at a similar stage of development. However, if the Company is unable to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance in the future at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims, the commercialization of products it develops could be hindered or prevented.\nCompulsory licensing or generic competition may affect the Company\u2019s business in certain countries.\nIn a number of countries, governmental authorities and other groups have suggested that companies which manufacture medical products (e.g., pharmaceuticals) should make products available at a low cost. In some cases, governmental authorities have held that where a pharmaceutical company does not do so, its patents might not be enforceable to prevent generic competition. Alternatively, some governmental authorities could require that ESSA grant compulsory licenses to allow competitors to manufacture and sell their own versions of ESSA\u2019s products, thereby reducing ESSA\u2019s sales or the sales of ESSA\u2019s licensee(s). In all of these situations, the results of future operations in these countries if any, could be adversely affected.\nESSA incurs significantly increased costs and devotes substantial management time as a result of operating as a public company.\nAs a public company, ESSA incurs significant legal, accounting and other expenses. For example, ESSA is subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and may be required to comply with the applicable requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules and regulations subsequently implemented by the SEC and including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. ESSA\u2019s continued compliance with these requirements increase its legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly. In addition, ESSA\u2019s management and other personnel need to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these public company requirements. In particular, ESSA may or in the future incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley, which involves annual assessments of a company\u2019s internal controls over financial reporting. ESSA may in the future need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge and may need to establish an internal audit function. ESSA cannot always predict or estimate the amount of additional costs incurred as a result of being a public company or the timing of such costs.\nRisks Related to Additional Legal Compliance and Regulatory Matters\nESSA is subject to risks inherent in foreign operations.\nESSA intends to pursue international market growth opportunities, such that international sales may account for a significant portion of its revenue. ESSA is subject to a number of risks associated with its potential international business operations, sales and marketing activities that may increase liability, costs, lengthen sales cycles and require significant management attention. These risks include:\n\u25cf compliance with the laws of the United States, Canada, the European Union and other jurisdictions where ESSA may conduct business, including import and export legislation;\n\u25cf increased reliance on third parties to establish and maintain foreign operations;\n\u25cf the complexities and expenses of administering a business abroad;\n\u25cf complications in compliance with, and unexpected changes in, foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf instability in economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession and actual or anticipated military conflicts, social upheaval or political uncertainty;\n\u25cf foreign currency fluctuations;\n\u25cf foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions;\n\u25cf tariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u25cf difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u25cf differing tax structures and related potential adverse tax consequences;\n\u25cf uncertainties of laws and enforcement relating to the protection of intellectual property or secured technology;\n\u25cf litigation in foreign court systems;\n\u25cf unauthorized copying or use of ESSA\u2019s intellectual property;\n\u25cf cultural and language differences;\n\u25cf difficulty in managing a geographically dispersed workforce in compliance with local laws and customs that vary from country to country; and\n\u25cf other factors, depending upon the country involved.\nThere can be no assurance that the policies and procedures ESSA implements to address or mitigate these risks will be successful, that ESSA\u2019s personnel will comply with them or that ESSA will not experience these factors in the future or that they will not have a material adverse effect on ESSA\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLaws and regulations governing international operations may preclude ESSA from developing, manufacturing and selling certain product candidates outside of the United States and Canada and require ESSA to develop and implement costly compliance programs.\nESSA must comply with numerous laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which ESSA plans to operate. ESSA must also comply with U.S. laws applicable to the foreign operations of U.S. individuals, such as the FCPA, and Canadian laws applicable to the foreign operations of Canadian businesses and individuals, such as the CFPOA. The creation and implementation of international business practices compliance programs is costly and such programs are difficult to enforce, particularly where reliance on third parties is required.\nThe CFPOA prohibits Canadian businesses and individuals from giving or offering to give a benefit of any kind to a foreign public official, or any other person for the benefit of the foreign public official, where the ultimate purpose is to obtain or retain a business advantage. Furthermore, a company may be found liable for violations by not only its employees, but also by its third-party agents. Any failure to comply with the CFPOA, as well as applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions, could result in substantial penalties or restrictions on ESSA\u2019s ability to conduct business in certain foreign jurisdictions, which may have a material adverse impact on ESSA and its share price.\nThe FCPA prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring ESSA to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. The anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA are enforced primarily by the Department of Justice. The SEC is involved with enforcement of the books and records provisions of the FCPA.\nCompliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, the FCPA presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical studies and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions.\nViolation of the FCPA can result in significant civil and criminal penalties. Indictment alone under the FCPA can lead to suspension of the right to do business with the U.S. government until the pending claims are resolved. Conviction of a violation of the FCPA can result in long-term disqualification as a government contractor. The termination of a government contract or relationship as a result of ESSA\u2019s failure to satisfy any of its obligations under laws governing international business practices would have a negative impact on its operations and harm its reputation and ability to procure government contracts. The SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA\u2019s accounting provisions.\nESSA\u2019s employees or other agents may, without the Company\u2019s knowledge and despite the Company\u2019s efforts, engage in prohibited conduct under its policies and procedures and the CFPOA, FCPA or other anti-bribery laws that ESSA may be subject to for which it may be held responsible. If ESSA\u2019s employees or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices, it could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVarious laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside of the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. If ESSA expands its presence outside of the United States in the future, it will be required to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude ESSA from developing, manufacturing, or selling certain products and product candidates outside of the United States, which could limit ESSA\u2019s growth potential and increase development costs.\nESSA is subject to U.S. laws relating to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights.\nAs a pharmaceutical company, even though ESSA does not and will not control referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to ESSA\u2019s future arrangements with third-party payors and customers who are in a position to purchase, recommend and/or prescribe ESSA\u2019s product candidates for which the Company obtains marketing approval. These broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations may constrain ESSA\u2019s future business or financial arrangements and relationships with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers, and third-party payors and other entities, including ESSA\u2019s marketing practices, educational programs and pricing policies. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may affect ESSA\u2019s ability to operate include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, among other things, prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u25cf civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, among other things, prohibits individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent or from knowingly making a false statement to improperly avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\nEfforts to ensure that ESSA\u2019s business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that ESSA\u2019s business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance, or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If ESSA\u2019s operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to ESSA, the Company may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of ESSA\u2019s operations. If any physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom ESSA expects to do business are found to not be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Moreover, ESSA expects there will continue to be federal and state laws and regulations, proposed and implemented, that could impact ESSA\u2019s operations and business. The extent to which future legislation or regulations, if any, relating to healthcare fraud abuse laws or enforcement, may be enacted or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on ESSA\u2019s business remains uncertain.\nIf ESSA fails to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, ESSA could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of ESSA\u2019s business.\nESSA is subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in the United States and in Canada, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. ESSA\u2019s operations could involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. ESSA\u2019s operations could also produce hazardous waste products. The Company\u2019s general practice would be to contract with third parties for the disposal of such materials and wastes. ESSA cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from ESSA\u2019s use of hazardous materials, it could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed its resources. ESSA also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough ESSA maintains workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover for costs and expenses ESSA may incur due to injuries to employees resulting from the use of any hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. ESSA does not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against it in connection with its storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials.\nIn addition, ESSA may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair ESSA\u2019s research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nThe change from foreign private issuer to U.S. domestic issuer status may result in additional costs and expenses to us.\nAs of March 31, 2020, we determined that we no longer qualify as a \u201cforeign private issuer,\u201d as such term is defined in Rule 405 under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d). As a result, as of October 1, 2020, we are no longer eligible to use the rules and forms designated for foreign private issuers and we are considered a U.S. domestic issuer. The regulatory and compliance costs to us under U.S. securities laws as a U.S. domestic issuer may be significantly more than the costs incurred as a foreign private issuer. As a result, we are now required to file periodic and current reports and registration statements on U.S. domestic issuer forms with the SEC, which are generally more detailed and extensive than the forms available to a foreign private issuer. In addition, we are required to comply with U.S. proxy requirements and Regulation FD (Fair Disclosure) and our officers, directors and principal shareholders are subject to the beneficial ownership reporting and short-swing profit recovery requirements in Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). We are also no longer eligible to rely upon exemptions from corporate governance requirements that are available to foreign private issuers or to benefit from other accommodations for foreign private issuers under the rules of the SEC or Nasdaq, which may involve additional costs.\nESSA is and there is a risk that ESSA may continue to be a \u201cpassive foreign investment company\u201d which would likely result in materially adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences for U.S. investors.\nESSA believes it was classified as a PFIC for the taxable year ending September 30, 2020, and believes it may be classified as a PFIC for the current taxable year and in future taxable years. However, the determination as to whether ESSA is a PFIC for any taxable year is based on the application of complex U.S. federal income tax rules that are subject to differing interpretations. If ESSA is a PFIC for any taxable year during which a U.S. Holder (as defined under \u201cUnited States Federal Income Tax Considerations\u201d) holds the Common Shares, it would likely result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences for such U.S. Holder. U.S. Holders should carefully read \u201cUnited States Federal Income Tax Considerations-Passive Foreign Investment Company Rules\u201d for more information and consult their own tax advisors regarding the consequences of ESSA being treated as a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, including the advisability of making a qualified electing fund (\u201cQEF\u201d) election (including a protective election), which may mitigate certain possible adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences but may result in an inclusion in gross income without receipt of such income.\nThe Company\u2019s status as an Emerging Growth Company and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to Emerging Growth Companies may make the Common Shares less attractive to investors.\nESSA is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). As such, the Company is eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, and delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies. ESSA will not take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This election is irrevocable.\nESSA may take advantage of some or all of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available to it so long as it qualifies as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and thus the level of information provided may be different than that of other U.S. public companies. If ESSA does take advantage of any of these exemptions, some investors may find its securities less attractive, which could result in a less active trading market for ESSA\u2019s Common Shares, and its share price may be more volatile as a result.\nESSA could be an emerging growth company until the last day of the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of its U.S. initial public offering, although circumstances could cause ESSA to lose that status earlier if annual revenues exceed US$1.07 billion, if ESSA issues more than US$1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in any three-year period or if ESSA becomes a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.\nIt may be difficult for United States investors to effect services of process or enforcement of actions against the Company or certain of its directors and officers under U.S. federal securities laws.\nThe Company is incorporated under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada. Its directors and officers reside in Canada or the United States. Because a number of these persons and a substantial portion of the assets of the Company are located outside the United States, it will be difficult for United States investors to effect service of process in the United States upon the Company or the directors or officers of the Company, or to realize in the United States upon judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities under the Exchange Act or other United States laws. There is substantial doubt as to whether an original action could be brought successfully in Canada against any of such persons or the Company predicated solely upon such civil liabilities and whether a judgment of a United States court predicated solely upon such civil liabilities would be enforceable in Canada by a Canadian court.\nRisks Relating to ESSA\u2019s Common Shares\nESSA\u2019s Common Shares could be delisted from the Nasdaq, which could affect ESSA\u2019s Common Shares\u2019 market price and liquidity.\nThe Company\u2019s listing on the Nasdaq is contingent upon meeting all the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq, which include maintaining (i) a minimum bid price of not less than $1.00 per share and (ii) either a minimum stockholders\u2019 equity of $2,500,000, a minimum market value of $35 million or a minimum $500,000 of net income from continuing operations. Nasdaq listing rules provide that noncompliance with such requirements exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days.\nIf the Company\u2019s Common Shares are delisted from the Nasdaq, its ability to raise capital in the future may be limited. Delisting could also result in less liquidity for the Company\u2019s shareholders and a lower share price. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of the Company\u2019s Common Shares and could impair the Company shareholders\u2019 ability to sell or purchase the Company\u2019s Common Shares. In the event of a delisting, the Company would expect to take actions to restore its compliance with the Nasdaq\u2019s listing requirements, but it can provide no assurance that any action taken by the Company would result in its Common Shares becoming listed again, or that any such action would stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of its Common Shares.\nThe market price and trading volume of ESSA\u2019s Common Shares may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for its shareholders or securities litigation.\nThe market price of ESSA\u2019s Common Shares may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume in the Common Shares may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur as demonstrated by ESSA\u2019s share price\u2019s low on the Nasdaq was $3.00 and high was $8.31 during the fiscal year. The market price of the Common Shares may fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect ESSA\u2019s share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of the Common Shares include:\n\u25cf quarterly variations in operating results;\n\u25cf operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u25cf change in valuations;\n\u25cf changes in ESSA\u2019s operations;\n\u25cf expenses ESSA incurs related to future research;\n\u25cf regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf fluctuations in the demand for ESSA\u2019s product candidates;\n\u25cf changes in the industry in which ESSA operates;\n\u25cf announcements by ESSA or other companies of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments, plans, prospects, service offerings or operating results;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf future sales of ESSA\u2019s securities;\n\u25cf trading of ESSA\u2019s securities by a large shareholder;\n\u25cf other risk factors discussed herein; and\n\u25cf other unforeseen events.\nStock markets in the United States and Canada have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Market fluctuations, as well as general political and economic conditions such as acts of terrorism, prolonged economic uncertainty, a recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations, could adversely affect the market price of ESSA\u2019s Common Shares resulting in substantial losses for shareholders. Also, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their common shares have been subject to securities litigation. ESSA may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against ESSA could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could materially harm ESSA\u2019s business.\nThe Company has never declared dividends and may not do so in the future.\nESSA has not declared or paid any cash dividends on Common Shares to date. The payment of dividends in the future will be dependent on ESSA\u2019s earnings and financial condition and on such other factors as ESSA\u2019s Board considers appropriate. Unless and until ESSA pays dividends, shareholders may not receive a return on their shares. There is no present intention by the Board to pay dividends on the Common Shares.\nThe Company may experience future sales or issue additional securities.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s equity securities could decline as a result of issuances of securities by the Company or sales by the Company\u2019s existing shareholders of Common Shares in the market, or the perception that such sales could occur. Sales of Common Shares by shareholders might also make it more difficulty for the Company to sell equity securities at a time and price that the Company deems appropriate. Sales or issuances of substantial numbers of Common Shares, or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect the prevailing market prices of the Common Shares. With any additional sale or issuance of Common Shares, investors will suffer dilution to their voting power and the Company may experience dilution in its earnings per share.\nAdditionally, as of September 30, 2020, there are 8,863,504 pre-funded warrants outstanding, which are exercisable into Common Shares at a nominal exercise price. If holders of these pre-funded warrants exercise these securities, existing shareholders will suffer dilution to their voting power and the Company may experience dilution in its earnings per share, as well as a negative impact on its share price.\nIf ESSA is unable to implement and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future, ESSA may not be able to report financial results accurately or prevent fraud. In that case, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of ESSA\u2019s financial reports and the market price of ESSA\u2019s Common Shares may be negatively affected.\nMaintaining effective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for ESSA to produce reliable financial reports and is important in helping to prevent financial fraud. If ESSA is unable to maintain adequate internal controls, ESSA\u2019s business and operating results could be harmed.\nPursuant to Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules of the SEC, ESSA\u2019s management is required to, among other things, assess annually the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting and certify that it has established effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting for the period ended September 30, 2020. As a non-accelerated public company, ESSA is not currently required to comply with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nPreparing ESSA\u2019s consolidated financial statements involves a number of complex manual and automated processes which are dependent on individual data input or review and require significant management judgment. One or more of these elements may result in errors that may not be detected and could result in a material misstatement of ESSA\u2019s consolidated financial statements. Management\u2019s significant estimates and judgements with respect to financial reporting are discussed and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.\nThe process of designing and implementing effective internal controls and procedures, and expanding ESSA\u2019s internal accounting capabilities, is a continuous effort that requires ESSA to anticipate and react to changes in ESSA\u2019s business and the economic and regulatory environments and expend significant resources to establish and maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy ESSA\u2019s reporting obligations as a public company. The standards that must be met for management to assess the internal control over financial reporting as effective are complex, and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards. ESSA cannot be certain at this time whether the Company will be able to successfully complete the continuing implementation of controls and procedures or the certification and attestation requirements of Section 404(a) of Sarbanes-Oxley on a continuous basis.\nIf a material misstatement occurs in the future, ESSA may fail to meet its future reporting obligations, it may need to restate its financial results and the price of its Common Shares may decline. Any failure of ESSA\u2019s internal controls could also adversely affect the results of the periodic management evaluations and any future annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of ESSA\u2019s internal control over financial reporting that may be required when Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley becomes fully applicable to ESSA. Effective internal controls are necessary for ESSA to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. If ESSA cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, ESSA\u2019s business and results of operations could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in ESSA\u2019s reported financial information, and the trading price of ESSA\u2019s Common Shares could drop significantly.\nAn active trading market for the Common Shares may not be sustained.\nAlthough ESSA has listed the Common Shares on the Nasdaq, an active trading market for the Common Shares may not be sustained. If an active trading market for the Common Shares is not maintained, the liquidity of the Common Shares and the prices that may be obtained for the Common Shares will be adversely affected.\nESSA\u2019s Common Shares may be thinly traded, the prices at which Common Shares trade are volatile and the buying or selling actions of a few shareholders may adversely affect ESSA\u2019s share price.\nAs of September 30, 2020, ESSA\u2019s public float, which is defined as Common Shares outstanding minus Common Shares held by officers, directors, or beneficial holders of greater than 10% of ESSA\u2019s outstanding Common Shares, represented approximately 11.14% of ESSA\u2019s outstanding Common Shares. In addition, the Company is aware of a number of significant shareholders, defined as a holding greater than 5%, who have participated in recent financings. The average number of shares traded in any given day over the past year has been relatively small compared to the public float. Thus, the actions of a few shareholders either buying or selling ESSA\u2019s Common Shares may adversely affect the price of the Common Shares. Historically, securities similar to ESSA\u2019s Common Shares have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that do not necessarily relate to operating performance and could result in rapid and substantial losses for shareholders.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about ESSA\u2019s business, its stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for ESSA\u2019s Common Shares depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about it, or its business. If one or more of the securities or industry analysts who cover ESSA downgrade its Common Shares or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about its business, its stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of ESSA or fail to publish reports on it regularly, demand for ESSA\u2019s stock could decrease, which might cause its stock price and trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 15508, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "EPIX"}
