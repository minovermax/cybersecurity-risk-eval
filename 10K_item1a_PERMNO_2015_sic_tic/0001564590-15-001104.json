{"cik": "933136", "company": "WMI HOLDINGS CORP.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nThe risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the United States and globally, as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial.\nRisks Related to WMIHC\u2019s Business\nWMIHC and its subsidiaries have limited operations; WMIHC is a holding company, and its only material assets are cash on hand, cash held in trust and its equity interests in its operating subsidiary and its other investments, and WMIHC\u2019s principal source of revenue and cash flow are distributions and certain payments from our wholly-owned subsidiary, WMMRC, which is operating in runoff mode and is subject to restrictions from paying us dividends and investment income from our investment portfolio.\nAs a holding company, our only material assets are our cash on hand, cash held in trust, the equity interests in our subsidiaries (WMMRC and WMIIC) and other investments. As of December 31, 2014, WMIHC had no operations other than WMMRC\u2019s legacy reinsurance business with respect to mortgage insurance which is being operated in runoff mode. WMMRC has not written any new business since the Petition Date. As of December 31, 2014, excluding restricted cash and assets held in trust, we had approximately $86.1 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, which includes $8.8 million held by our wholly-owned subsidiary, WMMRC; WMIIC holds no assets and generates no revenues. For the foreseeable future, our principal source of revenue and cash flow will be investment income from our investment portfolio, if any, use of cash and cash equivalents, distributions from our operating subsidiary, if any, and certain payments made to us by WMMRC pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreement, dated as of March 19, 2012, between WMIHC and WMMRC (the \u201cAdministrative Services Agreement\u201d) and the Investment Management Agreement, dated as of March 19, 2012, between WMIHC and WMMRC (the \u201cInvestment Management Agreement\u201d). WMMRC is restricted by the Indentures from making distributions to WMIHC until the Runoff Notes are paid in full and is restricted by insurance law from making distributions to us unless prior approval is obtained from the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Hawaii. Thus, our ability to service our debt, finance acquisitions and pay dividends to our shareholders in the future is dependent on (i) the ability of our operating subsidiary to generate sufficient net income and cash flows to make upstream cash distributions to us, and (ii) our ability to obtain access to the funds held in escrow from the Series B Preferred Stock Financing. Our subsidiaries are and will be separate legal entities, and although they may be wholly-owned or controlled by us, they have no obligation to make any funds available to us, whether in the form of loans, dividends, distributions or otherwise except for distributions of Runoff Proceeds (as defined in the Indentures) to pay the holders of the Runoff Notes under the Indentures. The ability of our operating subsidiary to distribute cash to us will also be subject to, among other things, restrictions that are contained in our Indentures, availability of sufficient funds and applicable state laws and regulatory restrictions. Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries generally will have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and claims of our creditors and shareholders. To the extent the ability of our operating subsidiary to distribute dividends or other payments to us could be limited in any way, this could materially limit our ability to grow, pursue business opportunities or make acquisitions that could be beneficial to our businesses, otherwise fund and conduct our business or fund dividends, redemptions or repurchases.\nFuture acquisitions or business opportunities could involve unknown risks that could harm our business and adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe are a holding company that holds all of the equity interests of WMMRC and WMIIC. In the future we intend to acquire other businesses or make other acquisitions that may involve unknown risks, some of which will be particular to the industry in which the business or acquisition target or targets operate. Although we intend to conduct business, financial and legal due diligence in connection with the evaluation of future business or acquisition opportunities, there can be no assurance our due diligence investigations will identify every matter that could have a material adverse effect on us. The realization of any unknown risks could prevent or limit us from realizing the projected benefits of the businesses or acquisitions, which could adversely affect our financial condition and liquidity. In addition, our financial condition, results of operations and the ability to service our debt will be subject to the specific risks applicable to any business or company we acquire.\nThe nature of certain of our assets is volatile and their value may fluctuate or change over short periods of time.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $152.2 million cash and other securities, of which approximately $79.7 million was held directly by WMIHC and approximately $72.5 million was held by WMMRC. Under most circumstances, WMMRC\u2019s cash will not be available for use by WMIHC until the Runoff Notes are paid in full. Investing in securities other than U.S. government instruments will likely result in a higher risk of loss to us, particularly in light of uncertain domestic and global political, credit and financial market conditions. We value these securities for various purposes based on a number of factors, including, without limitation, third-party independent valuations. Because valuations, and particularly valuations of private securities and illiquid securities, are inherently uncertain, such valuations may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time and may differ materially from the values that would have been obtained if an active market existed for these securities.\nWMIHC, together with its subsidiaries, may not be able to fully utilize our net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) and other tax carry forwards.\nAs of December 31, 2012, WMIHC and its subsidiaries had U.S. federal NOLs of approximately $7.54 billion, of which approximately $5.97 billion was allocated to that portion of 2012 after the ownership change described below, that, if unused, will begin to expire in 2031. We believe that, as of December 31, 2014, WMIHC and its subsidiaries had NOLs not subject to limitation under Section 382 (\u201cSection 382\u201d) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) of approximately $6.00 billion. Both WMIHC and WMMRC caused 100 percent valuation allowances to be recorded against these deferred tax assets.\nOn the Effective Date, we believe that WMIHC and its subsidiaries experienced an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. An ownership change is generally defined as a more than 50 percentage point increase in equity ownership by \u201c5 percent shareholders\u201d (as that term is defined for purposes of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code) in any three-year period or since the last ownership change if such prior ownership change occurred within the prior three-year period. As a result of the ownership change on the Effective Date, the limitations on the use of pre-change losses and other carry forward tax attributes in Sections 382 and 383 of the Code apply and WMIHC and its subsidiaries will only be able to utilize a small portion of their NOL carry forwards from the years prior to 2012 and the portion of the NOL for 2012 allocable to the portion of the year prior to March 20, 2012. The utilization of the NOL for 2012 allocable to the portion of the year after the Effective Date and the NOLs from subsequent years should not be affected by the ownership change on the Effective Date.\nThe ability of WMIHC and its subsidiaries, and any future subsidiary (including a subsidiary acquired in any Acquisition (as defined in the Designation of Rights and Preferences of the 3% Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the \u201cCertificate of Designation\u201d) creating the Series B Preferred Stock)), to utilize their NOLs and other tax carry forwards to reduce taxable income in future years may be limited for various reasons, including if projected future taxable income is insufficient to recognize the full benefit of such NOL carry forwards prior to their expiration and/or the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) challenges that a transaction or transactions were concluded with the principal purpose of evasion or avoidance of Federal income tax. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient taxable income in later years to enable the Company to use the NOLs before they expire, or that the IRS will not challenge the use of the NOLs. Additionally, the ability of WMIHC and its subsidiaries (and any future subsidiary) to fully use these tax assets could also be adversely affected if the respective companies were deemed to have another \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. Although we have certain transfer restrictions in place under our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended (the \u201cArticles\u201d), our Board of Directors could issue additional shares of stock or permit future conversions or redemptions of our stock, which, depending on their magnitude, could result in ownership changes that would trigger the imposition of additional limitations on the utilization of our NOLs under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that, in the future, WMIHC and/or its subsidiaries (and any future subsidiary) will be able to utilize its NOLs or not experience additional limitations on utilizing the tax benefits of their NOLs and other tax carry forwards. Such limitations could have a material adverse effect on WMIHC and/or its subsidiaries\u2019 results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nIn an attempt to minimize the likelihood of an additional ownership change occurring, our Articles contain transfer restrictions limiting the acquisition (and disposition) of our stock or any other instrument treated as stock for purposes of Section 382 by persons or group of persons treated as a single entity under Treasury Regulation Section 1.382-3 owning (actually or constructively), or who would own as a result of the transaction, 4.75 percent of the total value of our stock (including any other interests treated as stock for purposes of Section 382). Nevertheless, it is possible that we could undergo an additional ownership change, either by events within or outside of the control of our Board of Directors, e.g., indirect changes in the ownership of persons owning 5 percent of our stock. Also, in the event that the Second Lien Notes, are re-characterized as equity, transfers of such notes might be taken into account for purposes of Section 382 of the Code. Moreover, approximately 2.9 million shares of our Common Stock are held in escrow in the Disputed Equity Escrow (as defined in the Bankruptcy Plan). A subsequent release or transfer of the stock potentially could result in an ownership change of WMIHC at that time. In the event of a subsequent ownership change, all or part of the NOLs from 2012 and subsequent years that were previously unlimited could also become subject to an annual limitation.\nThe IRS could challenge the amount, timing and/or use of our NOL carry forwards.\nThe amount of our NOL carry forwards has not been audited or otherwise validated by the IRS. Among other things, the IRS could challenge whether an ownership change occurred on the Effective Date, as well as the amount, the timing and/or our use of our NOLs. Any such challenge, if successful, could significantly limit our ability to utilize a portion or all of our NOL carry forwards. In addition, calculating whether an ownership change has occurred within the meaning of Section 382 of the Code is subject to inherent uncertainty, both because of the complexity of applying Section 382 of the Code and because of limitations on a publicly-traded company\u2019s knowledge as to the ownership of, and transactions in, its securities. Therefore, the calculation of the amount of our utilizable NOL carry forwards could be changed as a result of a successful challenge by the IRS or as a result of new information about the ownership of, and transactions in, our securities.\nPossible changes in legislation could negatively affect our ability to use the tax benefits associated with our NOL carry forwards.\nThe rules relating to U.S. federal income taxation are periodically under review by persons involved in the legislative and administrative rulemaking processes, by the IRS and by the U.S. Treasury Department, resulting in revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts as well as statutory changes. Future revisions in U.S. federal tax laws and interpretations thereof could adversely impact our ability to use some or all of the tax benefits associated with our NOL carry forwards.\nIf we are unable to identify and/or make acquisitions or there are delays in finding suitable acquisition targets or we make acquisitions that are not successful, WMIHC will likely never achieve sustained profitability, which would adversely affect the value of the Company.\nOur ability to successfully execute an acquisition strategy will impact our ability to achieve profitability and grow our business. There can be no assurances that we will be successful in this endeavor. We may need additional capital to complete an acquisition, but there can be no assurances that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital. WMIHC\u2019s inability to make acquisitions will impair WMIHC\u2019s ability to be profitable. WMIHC may not be able to achieve profitability on a sustained basis. There may be a substantial period of time before we are able to invest and make suitable acquisitions. Delays we encounter in the selection, acquisition and/or development of targets could adversely affect the value of the Company.\nWMIHC retained Blackstone Advisory Partners L.P. (\u201cBlackstone\u201d) in July 2012 to work with us to develop our acquisition strategy and to identify, consider and evaluate potential mergers, acquisitions, business combinations and other strategic opportunities. We terminated our engagement with Blackstone on January 6, 2015, and have not engaged a new independent financial advisor. While we will continue to work with KKR Capital Markets LLC and our existing management and consultants to identify suitable acquisition targets, there can be no assurance that (a) we will be able to identify any such acquisition targets, or (b) we will be able to consummate an acquisition if and when an acquisition target is identified.\nOur Board of Directors may change our investment strategy without shareholder approval, which could alter the nature of your investment.\nOur Board of Directors continues to develop and review the strategic and investment strategy for the Company and determine what is in the best interest of our shareholders. This strategy may change over time. The methods of implementing our strategy may vary, as trends emerge and new investment opportunities develop. Our strategy, the methods for its implementation, and our other objectives, may be altered by our Board of Directors without the approval of our shareholders. As a result, the nature of your investment could change without your consent.\nWMIHC no longer has a senior credit facility available.\nWMIHC had a senior secured multi-draw term loan with an aggregate original principal amount not to exceed $125.0 million, subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the Financing Agreement (the \u201cFinancing Agreement\u201d), dated as of March 19, 2012, by and among WMIHC, WMIIC, the lenders party thereto (each a \u201cLender\u201d and collectively, the \u201cLenders\u201d) and U.S. Bank National Association, a national banking association, as administrative agent for the Lenders. WMIHC had never drawn on the Financing Agreement. The Financing Agreement was due to terminate in accordance with its terms on March 19, 2015. In connection with the Series B Preferred Stock Financing, the Financing Agreement was terminated and WMIHC no longer has access to these funds. We may need additional capital and/or debt to complete an acquisition, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital or obtain sufficient debt financing.\nThe Subordinated Notes (as defined below) may only be used to fund permitted acquisitions, and the availability of funding under the Note Purchase Agreement, with the guarantors party thereto and KKR Management, is subject to certain conditions and performance by KKR Management, and will terminate following consummation of the Reincorporation.\nIn connection with the Series B Preferred Stock Financing, the parties to the Note Purchase Agreement executed an amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement that has the effect of terminating the Note Purchase Agreement immediately following the consummation of the Reincorporation, in which case WMIHC will no longer have access to this funding arrangement. We may need additional capital to complete an acquisition, but there can be no assurances that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital. The amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement also waives any and all defaults, events of default and rights to terminate the Note Purchase Agreement arising as a result of the issuance of Series B Preferred Stock and also permits the performance of, and compliance with, all of the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock. Unless and until the Reincorporation is consummated, the Note Purchase Agreement will remain in effect, subject to its terms as amended by the amendment.\nPursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, WMIHC may, at its election, issue up to $150 million aggregate principal amount (at issuance) of subordinated 7.50 percent PIK notes (the \u201cSubordinated Notes\u201d) to KKR Management, on one or more occasions until January 30, 2017, subject to certain terms and conditions. WMIHC has not issued any Subordinated Notes.\nKKR Management\u2019s obligation to purchase the Subordinated Notes is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including the absence of defaults and events of defaults under the Note Purchase Agreement, the pro forma solvency of WMIHC and its subsidiaries, compliance with the provisions of the certificate of designation of WMIHC\u2019s convertible stock and compliance with certain sections of the Investor Rights Agreement. If the above conditions are not met by WMIHC or waived by KKR Management, then WMIHC may not have access to adequate funding for the purchase of the desired acquisition.\nIn the event KKR Management refuses to purchase, or is unable to purchase, such Subordinated Notes, in violation of the Note Purchase Agreement, our legal remedies to enforce our right to require KKR Management to purchase the Subordinated Notes pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement may not be adequate to allow us to consummate the desired acquisition.\nThe Note Purchase Agreement contains restrictive covenants that may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nThe Note Purchase Agreement restricts, among other things, asset dispositions, mergers and acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases and redemptions, other restricted payments, indebtedness and preferred stock, loans and investments, liens and affiliate transactions. These covenants, among other things, limit our ability to fund future working capital and capital expenditures, engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a portion of cash flow from operations to payments on debt.\nThe restrictive covenants in the Note Purchase Agreement are subject to a number of important qualifications, exceptions and limitations, and are subject to amendment.\nThe restrictive covenants in the Note Purchase Agreement are subject to a number of important qualifications, exceptions and limitations. This means that the restrictions are not absolute prohibitions. WMIHC and its subsidiaries may be able to engage in some of the restricted activities, such as incurring additional debt, paying dividends, making investments, selling assets and entering into mergers or other business combinations, in limited amounts or in certain circumstances, notwithstanding the restrictive covenants. These actions could adversely affect our financial condition and the value of WMIHC. In addition, the restrictive covenants in the Note Purchase Agreement can be amended by a majority of the holders of the Subordinated Notes then outstanding, and any such amendment would bind all holders, including ones that did not vote in favor of the amendment. Any such amendment could delete one or more restrictive covenants or add additional qualifications, exceptions or limitations. We will continue to be subject to the foregoing restrictive covenants if we do not consummate the Reincorporation.\nChanges in disclosure laws or interpretations resulting in higher compliance costs are likely to adversely affect WMIHC\u2019s future consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nCompliance with laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and new regulations enacted by the SEC, are resulting in increased compliance costs. WMIHC, like all other public companies, is incurring expenses and diverting employees\u2019 time in an effort to comply with such laws. WMIHC is an accelerated reporting company, and has completed the process of documenting and evaluating its systems of internal control. We expect to continue to devote the necessary resources, including internal and external resources, to support WMIHC\u2019s assessment and compliance with its disclosure obligations as these disclosure obligations evolve and change. In addition, during the bankruptcy, WMI adopted so-called \u201cModified Exchange Act Reporting\u201d under the SLB 2. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, WMIHC continues to rely upon the guidance set forth in SLB 2 and we have filed and will continue to file the Exchange Act periodic reports for all periods that begin after the Effective Date of the Plan. If the SEC determines that WMIHC is not able to follow or rely on Modified Exchange Act Reporting under SLB 2, much more extensive historical disclosure requirements could be imposed on WMIHC which we may not be able to satisfy and which would have a material adverse effect on the Company, including but not limited to, substantial compliance costs and sanctions. Compliance with different or evolving standards will result in increased general and administrative expenses and may cause a significant diversion of our time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities and could subject WMIHC to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities.\nLitigation against WMIHC could be costly and time consuming to defend.\nWMIHC may from time to time be subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation may result in substantial costs and may divert our attention and WMIHC resources, which may seriously harm our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nAn unfavorable judgment against WMIHC in any legal proceeding or claim could require WMIHC to pay monetary damages. In addition, an unfavorable judgment in which the counterparty is awarded equitable relief, such as an injunction, could have an adverse impact on WMIHC\u2019s business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\nBecause WMIHC\u2019s operations are highly dependent on key executives and employees, our inability to recruit and retain capable management could hinder our current operations and business plans.\nWe have very limited staffing and management resources and we are highly dependent on our interim executive officers, consultants and certain key employees. WMIHC\u2019s Interim Chief Executive Officer, Charles Edward Smith, is an employee of the Trust, and its Interim Chief Financial Officer, Timothy F. Jaeger, is a self-employed consultant engaged by the Company to provide financial reporting services. In addition, in November of 2014, the Company retained two consultants to assist with acquisitions. As of December 31, 2014, the Company had two employees. However, minimal staffing and any inability of WMIHC to engage new executive officers or key employees in the event its interim executive officers or key employees terminate employment could have a material adverse impact on our operations or delay or curtail the attainment of WMIHC\u2019s objectives.\nBusiness interruptions could limit WMIHC\u2019s ability to operate its business.\nWMIHC\u2019s operations, as well as others on which WMIHC depends, are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire; natural disasters, including earthquakes; computer viruses; human error; power shortages; telecommunication failures; international acts of terror; and similar events. WMIHC\u2019s offices are located in Seattle, Washington and we currently share office space with and obtain certain key services from the Trust pursuant to the TSA. The TSA, as amended extends the term of the agreement through April 30, 2015, with automatic renewals thereafter for successive additional three-month terms, subject to non-renewal at the end of any additional term upon written notice by either party at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the additional term.\nAlthough we have certain business continuity plans in place, we have not established a formal comprehensive disaster recovery plan, and WMIHC\u2019s back-up operations and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate it for losses WMIHC may suffer. A significant business interruption, including an unexpected non-renewal or termination of the TSA, could result in losses or damages incurred by WMIHC and require the Company to cease or curtail its operations at our current location.\nWe are subject to regulation by various federal and state entities.\nWe are subject to the regulations of the SEC and the Insurance Commissioner of the State of Hawaii. New regulations issued by these agencies may adversely affect our ability to carry on our business activities. We are subject to various federal and state laws and certain changes in these laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations. Noncompliance with certain of these regulations may impact our business plans.\nWe are also subject to the accounting rules and regulations of the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Changes in accounting rules could adversely affect the reported financial statements or our results of operations and may also require extraordinary efforts or additional costs to implement. Any of these laws or regulations may be modified or changed from time to time, and there is no assurance that such modifications or changes will not adversely affect us.\nDue to the increased number of holders of our Runoff Notes, any future actions, including, but not limited to, commutations, that require the consent of the holders of our Runoff Notes are likely to be more time consuming and expensive, and there can be no assurance that the requisite consent will be obtained.\nIn connection with, and as a condition to, the completion of the transactions contemplated by the commutation agreement between WMMRC and UGRIC, we obtained the consent of the Trust, at the time the beneficial owner of at least two-thirds in aggregate principal amount of the notes outstanding under the Indentures, to certain limited waiver agreements. On May 1, 2014, the Trust distributed the Runoff Notes held by the Trust to certain beneficiaries, and as a result is no longer the beneficial owner of at least two-thirds in aggregate principal amount of the Runoff Notes. A majority of these Runoff Notes were distributed to individual beneficiary brokerage accounts, and certain of the Runoff Notes were certificated and sent to other holders. Consequently, due to the increased number of holders, any future actions, including, but not limited to, commutations, that require the consent of the holders of our Runoff Notes are likely to be more time consuming and expensive, and there can be no assurance that the requisite consent will be obtained.\nRisks Related to WMIHC\u2019s Emergence from Bankruptcy\nDespite having emerged from bankruptcy, WMIHC continues to be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with residual Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.\nWMI emerged from bankruptcy on the Effective Date and changed its name to WMIHC. Because of the residual risks and uncertainties associated with Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, the ultimate impact that events that occurred during, or that may occur subsequent to, these proceedings will have on WMIHC\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be accurately predicted or quantified. We cannot assure you that having been subject to bankruptcy protection will not adversely affect WMIHC\u2019s operations going forward.\nBecause our historical consolidated financial statements reflect fresh start reporting adjustments following emergence from bankruptcy, as well as effects of the transactions contemplated by the Plan, financial information in our future financial statements will not be comparable to WMI\u2019s financial information prior to our emergence from bankruptcy.\nFollowing emergence from Chapter 11, we adopted fresh start reporting in accordance with ASC 852 (Reorganizations), pursuant to which the reorganization value of the entity was assigned to the entity\u2019s assets and liabilities in conformity with the procedures specified by ASC 805 (Business Combinations), which requires that the entity measure the identifiable assets and liabilities at their acquisition-date fair values. Adopting fresh start reporting resulted in a new reporting entity with no beginning retained earnings or deficit. In addition to the adoption of fresh start reporting, our post-emergence consolidated financial statements reflect effects of the transactions contemplated by the Plan. Thus, our future balance sheets and results of operations may not be entirely comparable in certain respects to balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations data for periods prior to the adoption of fresh start reporting and prior to accounting for the effects of the reorganization. Our historical financial information may not be indicative of future financial information.\nRisks Related to Owning WMIHC\u2019s Stock\nOur stock is subject to transfer restrictions under our Articles.\nOur Articles contain significant transfer restrictions in relation to the transfer of our stock (including any other instruments treated as stock for purposes of Section 382). These court-approved transfer restrictions have been adopted in order to minimize the likelihood that we will be deemed to have an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382 that could limit our ability to utilize significant NOL carry forwards under and in accordance with regulations promulgated by the IRS. In particular, without the approval of our Board of Directors, (i) no person or group of persons treated as a single entity under Treasury Regulation Section 1.382-3 will be permitted to acquire, whether directly or indirectly, and whether in one transaction or a series of related transactions, any of our stock or any other instrument treated as stock for purposes of Section 382, to the extent that after giving effect to such purported acquisition (a) the purported acquirer or any other person by reason of the purported acquirer\u2019s acquisition would become a Substantial Holder (as defined below), or (b) the percentage stock ownership of a person that, prior to giving effect to the purported acquisition, is already a Substantial Holder would be increased; and (ii) no Substantial Holder may dispose, directly or indirectly, of any class of stock or any other instrument treated as stock for purposes of Section 382. A \u201cSubstantial Holder\u201d is a person that owns (as determined for purposes of Section 382) at least 4.75 percent of the total value of our stock, including any instrument treated as stock for purposes of Section 382.\nWMIHC\u2019s common stock is currently trading over-the-counter on the OTCQB electronic quotation system without the support of WMIHC and caution is advised.\nOur common stock is not currently listed on an exchange or a national market. Our common stock currently trades over-the-counter on OTC Markets OTCQB electronic quotation system (\u201cOTCQB\u201d) on an unsolicited quote basis, meaning that all prices reflect unsolicited customer orders. Investors are cautioned that no firm is making a market in our stock and investors may have a difficult time selling our stock. We have no control over the trading of our securities on the OTCQB or otherwise, except for the restrictions on transfers contained in our Articles. Although we must use reasonable efforts to list our common stock on a national securities exchange after becoming eligible to do so and upon approval of WMIHC\u2019s Board of Directors, there can be no assurance that we will satisfy eligibility standards for listing or otherwise be able to list our common stock on a timely basis, if at all.\nAlthough WMIHC\u2019s Common Stock is currently quoted on the OTCQB, if we do not meet or comply with the recent rule changes to the OTCQB our shares may be delisted from the OTCQB and would likely be traded on the OTC Pink (aka the Pink Sheets).\nAlthough WMIHC\u2019s common stock is currently quoted on the OTCQB, effective as of May 1, 2014, the OTC Markets Group, Inc. changed its rules for OTCQB eligibility. To be eligible for OTCQB, companies will be required to:\n\u00b7\nmeet a minimum bid price test of $0.01. Securities that do not meet the minimum bid price test will be downgraded to OTC Pink;\n\u00b7\nsubmit an application to OTCQB and pay an application and annual fee; and\n\u00b7\nsubmit an OTCQB Annual Certification confirming the Company Profile displayed on www.otcmarkets.com is current and complete and providing additional information on officers, directors and controlling shareholders.\nManagement has not yet determined whether it will submit the required application and pay the associated fees to remain quoted on the OTCQB. In the event we do not submit an application and pay those fees WMIHC\u2019s common stock will likely be downgraded to the OTC Pink, which could adversely affect the market liquidity of WMIHC common stock.\nWe may be unable to list WMIHC\u2019s common stock on a national securities exchange, which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in its common stock and subject us to trading restrictions.\nAlthough we will use our reasonable efforts to list our common stock on a national securities exchange after becoming eligible to do so and upon approval of our Board of Directors, there can be no assurance of whether or at what time such listing will occur. In order to list WMIHC\u2019s common stock on a national securities exchange, we will be required to demonstrate compliance with initial listing requirements, including certain financial, distribution and stock price levels. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements.\nIf we are not able to list WMIHC\u2019s common stock on a national securities exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u00b7\na limited availability of market quotations for WMIHC\u2019s common stock;\n\u00b7\nreduced liquidity for WMIHC\u2019s common stock;\n\u00b7\na determination that WMIHC\u2019s common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in WMIHC\u2019s common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for WMIHC\u2019s common stock;\n\u00b7\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u00b7\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our Articles and Amended and Restated Bylaws (\u201cBylaws\u201d) and under Washington law could make a third party acquisition of WMIHC difficult.\nWMIHC\u2019s Articles and Bylaws currently contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire WMIHC, even if doing so might be deemed beneficial by WMIHC\u2019s shareholders. These provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of WMIHC\u2019s common stock. WMIHC is also subject to certain provisions of Washington law that could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of WMIHC.\nWe may need to sell additional shares of WMIHC\u2019s common stock or other securities in the future to meet WMIHC\u2019s capital requirements. In such circumstances, the ownership interests of WMIHC\u2019s shareholders prior to such sale could be substantially diluted.\nWMIHC has 500,000,000 shares of common stock authorized for issuance and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock authorized for issuance. As of February 25, 2015, WMIHC had 202,343,245 shares of its common stock issued and outstanding. The possibility of dilution posed by shares available for future sale could reduce the market price of WMIHC\u2019s common stock and could make it more difficult for WMIHC to raise funds through equity offerings in the future. In fact, WMIHC has consummated two corporate financing transactions that are, on an as-converted basis, dilutive to shareholders, specifically, effective January 30, 2014, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries A Preferred Stock\u201d), and warrants to purchase 61,400,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. In connection with the Series B Preferred Stock Financing on January 5, 2015, 600,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, were issued effective January 5, 2015. For more information on the Series B Preferred Stock Financing, see Note 15: Subsequent Events to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to the Series B Preferred Stock Financing\nWe may not have sufficient funds to redeem or repurchase the Series B Preferred Stock or pay dividends.\nWe are required to redeem the Series B Preferred Stock (if not previously converted) on the third anniversary of January 5, 2015 (the \u201cIssue Date\u201d) in the event we have not consummated a Qualified Acquisition. In addition, we are required to offer to repurchase (if not previously converted) the Series B Preferred Stock upon a Change of Control or Post-Closing Covenant Default (as such terms are defined in the Certificate of Designation creating the Series B Preferred Stock). Furthermore, if and when declared by our Board and until the Series B Preferred Stock is converted, we are required to pay cumulative regular dividends out of funds legally available therefore at an annual rate of 3.00 percent per share of the liquidation preference of $1,000 per share of Series B Preferred Stock. However, we may not have sufficient funds, and we may be unable to obtain additional financing, to make such a redemption, repurchase or pay dividends as required. This risk is increased by the fact that we (i) have very limited operations, (ii) in the past have not generated significant cash flows, (iii) may use net proceeds that have been deposited into the escrow account in connection with the Series B Preferred Stock Financing to explore and fund, in whole or in part, acquisitions whether completed or not, including reasonable attorney fees and expenses, accounting expenses, due diligence and financial advisor fees and expenses, and (iv) may consummate an acquisition or acquisitions that do not constitute a Qualified Acquisition (and accordingly may use net proceeds that have been deposited into the escrow account), which may make it difficult for us to redeem or repurchase the Series B Preferred Stock as required or pay dividends.\nWe cannot consummate the Reincorporation without shareholder approval.\nWe are required to reincorporate as a Delaware corporation within 180 days after the Issue Date. If we do not consummate the Reincorporation for any reason within this time period, including because we do not obtain the requisite shareholder approval, we will be required to offer to repurchase the Series B Preferred Stock and we may not have sufficient funds to do so. Also, if we are unable to reincorporate in Delaware, we will remain a Washington corporation and shareholders will not receive many of the anticipated benefits typically associated with being a Delaware corporation, including greater efficiency, predictability and flexibility with respect to our legal affairs; access to Delaware\u2019s specialized courts for corporate law; an increase to our competitiveness in attracting talented and experienced directors and officers; an increase to our ability to raise capital; and the opportunity to reduce legal fees and administrative burdens. In addition, if we do not consummate the Reincorporation, the size of our Board of Directors will remain at seven and the new KKR designees will not join our Board of Directors and the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock will not be able to elect two additional directors upon certain payment failures by us.\nAdditionally, prior to consummating the Reincorporation, we will not have a number of authorized shares of our Common Stock sufficient to effect a mandatory conversion upon the occurrence of a Qualified Acquisition and may not have a number of authorized shares of our Common Stock sufficient to effect a mandatory conversion upon the occurrence of any Acquisition. Therefore, if a Qualified Acquisition is consummated prior to the Reincorporation, we will be able to convert only a portion of the outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock into Common Stock on the applicable Mandatory Conversion Date, leaving the remaining portion of Series B Preferred Stock unconverted and outstanding. Similarly, if an Acquisition is consummated prior to the Reincorporation, we may be able to convert only a portion of the outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock into Common Stock on the applicable Mandatory Conversion Date; in such event, the remaining portion of Series B Preferred Stock would be left unconverted and outstanding. In each case, those remaining unconverted shares of Series B Preferred Stock would retain the rights of the Series B Preferred Stock, including with respect to dividends, redemption, option to repurchase upon a put event and liquidation, and would be converted into shares of Common Stock upon the Reincorporation or on such earlier date that we have a sufficient number of authorized shares of our Common Stock to effect such conversion. However, there is no assurance that the Reincorporation will occur or that we will have a number of authorized shares of our Common Stock sufficient to consummate a mandatory conversion upon the occurrence of an Acquisition or a Qualified Acquisition. As a result some or all of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock may not convert into our Common Stock, in which case they would be redeemed on the Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined in the Certificate of Designation creating the Series B Preferred Stock).\nOur failure to consummate the Reincorporation by 180 days following the Issue Date will obligate us to offer to repurchase Series B Preferred Stock; however, we may not have sufficient funds to make such a repurchase or we may not be permitted to do so under applicable law.\nAffiliates of KKR own a substantial amount of equity interests in us, and have other substantial interests in us and agreements with us, and may have conflicts of interest with us or the other holders of our capital stock.\nPrior to the issuance of Series B Preferred Stock, affiliates of KKR held approximately 26.1 percent of our Common Stock (after giving effect to the exercise of outstanding Warrants and the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock). In addition, affiliates of KKR purchased $200.0 million in liquidation preference of the Series B Preferred Stock. Affiliates of KKR have also entered into the Note Purchase Agreement, the Investment Agreement and the Investor Rights Agreement with us, providing for the commitment to issue the Subordinated Notes, the Warrants and granting such affiliates of KKR certain rights with respect to our future equity issuances and allowing KKR to designate one member of our Board of Directors. In connection with the issuance of Series B Preferred Stock, the parties to the Note Purchase Agreement executed an amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement that will terminate the Note Purchase Agreement immediately following the consummation of the Reincorporation. In connection with the Reincorporation, two designees of KKR will join our Board of Directors.\nAs a result, affiliates of KKR may have substantial influence over our decisions to enter into any corporate transaction and may have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires the approval of shareholders regardless of whether other holders of our capital stock believe that any such transactions are in their own best interests. For example, affiliates of KKR could potentially cause us to refrain from making acquisitions in a manner that is not in the best interests of holders of the Series B Preferred Stock. KKR will not provide oversight of or have control over or be involved with the investment activities or other operations of the Company.\nNeither KKR nor its anticipated director appointees are required to present us with investment opportunities and may pursue them separately or otherwise compete with us.\nNeither KKR nor its anticipated director appointees are obligated to present us with investment opportunities. Moreover, each of KKR, our officers and our directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to another entity pursuant to which KKR, such officer or such director is required to present an acquisition opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of KKR, our officers or our directors becomes aware of an acquisition opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then current fiduciary or contractual obligations, it, he or she will honor its, his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such acquisition opportunity to such other entity, and only present it to us if such entity rejects the opportunity. After the Reincorporation, our Articles will provide that we renounce our interest or expectancy in any corporate opportunity in which KKR or its anticipated director appointees seek to participate unless such opportunity (i) was first presented to KKR\u2019s anticipated director appointees solely in their capacity as directors of WMIHC or (ii) is identified by KKR or its anticipated director appointees solely through the disclosure of information by or on behalf of us. We will not be prohibited from pursuing an investment opportunity with respect to which we have renounced our interest or expectancy.\nAdditionally, KKR is in the business of making investments in companies and may from time to time acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us or that compete with us for acquisitions. KKR may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, KKR\u2019s interest in its portfolio companies could impact our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities.\nKKR is not our investment advisor and owes no fiduciary duty to us or to holders of our Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock.\nKKR is not our investment adviser and otherwise has no advisory, fiduciary or similar relationship with us or with holders of our Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock. KKR is not our sponsor, and the Company is not an investment product offered by KKR. KKR has no obligations (contractual, fiduciary or otherwise) to us, disclaims having any liability for our performance, investments or activities, and will not be responsible for any action or inaction of our management.\nRisks Related to WMMRC\u2019s Business\nGeneral economic conditions that negatively affect housing prices may continue to negatively affect the credit performance of WMMRC\u2019s underlying portfolio of mortgage loans and could continue to have an adverse effect on our future performance.\nThe outlook for the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and there can be no assurances that recent signs of improvement in the housing and credit markets will continue or improve. Prolonged high unemployment and further deterioration in the housing markets could negatively impact the performance of WMMRC\u2019s underlying mortgage assets leading to a potential increase in defaults and losses.\nThe negative financial performance of the primary mortgage insurers with whom WMMRC does business is likely to negatively affect our financial performance and results.\nOne or more of the primary mortgage insurers with whom we do business may be vulnerable to adverse market conditions and because of that uncertainty there can be no assurances that such insurers can withstand the current market and financial pressures they may face from time to time. In fact, at least one counterparty is currently operating subject to state supervision. These factors could have negative consequences for WMMRC\u2019s cash flows and WMMRC\u2019s ability to pay dividends to WMIHC in the future, which in turn could adversely affect WMIHC\u2019s ability to service the Runoff Notes.\nWMMRC is dependent on primary mortgage insurers to provide it with services. A disruption in the provision of such services could negatively affect WMMRC\u2019s operations and financial performance.\nWMMRC depends upon our primary mortgage insurers to provide us with several services, including providing us with the monthly cession statements that provides the basis for our accounting and financial records, information regarding applicable minimum capital thresholds, the establishment of ceded loss reserves, the payment of ceded premium (i.e., revenue) and the withdrawal of funds for paid losses. If our counterparties are unable to provide such services or if such services are otherwise interrupted or modified as a result of actions beyond our control (e.g., the placement of a counterparty into receivership or conservatorship), then such actions may be detrimental to our future financial performance.\nBecause loss reserve estimates are subject to uncertainties and are based on assumptions that are currently volatile, ceded paid losses may be substantially different from our ceded loss reserves.\nThe establishment of loss reserves is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that is inherently uncertain. In addition, establishing such loss reserves requires management to make various assumptions and judgments based on a variety of factors, including frequency of losses, severity of losses and timing of losses. As a result, WMMRC periodically monitors and adjusts its assumptions based on actual loan performance information, market indicators and other factors. Nevertheless, factors outside of WMMRC\u2019s control, such as the overall performance of the economy, volatile housing prices, public policy considerations and borrower behavior all influence its assumptions and are subject to considerable change over time.\nLoan loss mitigation efforts (including efforts to modify loans, effect short sales, loan rescissions and claim denials) by the firms servicing our underlying reinsured mortgage loans may not be effective.\nWMMRC relies on the servicers of the mortgage loans to provide surveillance, loss mitigation and salvage efforts to ensure that the mortgage loans it reinsures are serviced according to the appropriate guidelines and significant efforts are made to ensure a beneficial outcome. Nevertheless, there can be no assurances that such efforts will be successful or have any effect on the ultimate ability of a borrower to satisfy such borrower\u2019s obligations under a mortgage WMMRC has reinsured.\nLow interest rates can negatively affect WMMRC\u2019s financial performance.\nA low interest rate environment can negatively affect WMMRC\u2019s financial performance. Low interest rates provide an opportunity for generally well-qualified borrowers to refinance their mortgage loans. This typically results in a cancelation of the mortgage insurance policy applicable to such loans and terminates any future premium ceded we would expect from those loans. As a result, the portfolio of mortgage loans WMMRC reinsures could experience a larger percentage in the number of borrowers who are less creditworthy. Additionally, a low-interest rate environment generally results in lower yields on WMMRC\u2019s investment portfolio, as maturing investments are generally reinvested at lower yields thereby reducing investment income.\nWMMRC is subject to comprehensive regulations, including minimum capital standards, which are subject to change and may harm our business.\nWMMRC is domiciled in the State of Hawaii and is subject to the rules and regulations as promulgated by the State of Hawaii and its Department of Insurance, its primary state regulator. Foremost among those rules and regulations are minimum capital standards. Management believes that as of December 31, 2014, WMMRC satisfied such minimum capital standards and other applicable rules and regulations. Nevertheless, there can be no assurances of WMMRC\u2019s future ability to meet those standards, or as they may be revised.\nIn addition, WMMRC\u2019s business may be affected by legislative or regulatory reforms of the U.S. housing finance system, as well as the application of certain public or private sector programs designed to assist homeowners avoid foreclosure. In each case, these reforms and programs could change the economic behavior of either the mortgage insurance policyholders or the mortgage insurance companies to the detriment of WMMRC. Following the severe financial dislocations of 2008, new, sweeping rules and rules and regulations were (and continue to be) promulgated by federal, state and local regulatory authorities, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d). Because WMMRC is currently operating its business in runoff mode, it has not, to date, needed to materially change any of its business practices in response to various regulatory initiatives, including the Dodd-Frank Act. Nevertheless, there can be no assurances that WMMRC will not be required to undertake changes to its business practices in the future in response to one or more regulatory initiatives.\nIn addition, WMMRC\u2019s reinsurance counterparties with active underwriting and other businesses have disclosed heightened regulatory oversight of their operations, including by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) and we cannot predict the extent to which such heightened scrutiny may affect how those counterparties do business with WMMRC. Likewise, neither WMMRC nor its counterparties can predict the full impact various regulatory initiatives currently pending or being considered may have on their respective businesses or operations.\nRisks Related to the Runoff Notes\nAny trading market that develops for the Runoff Notes may not be liquid; there are restrictions on transfers on the Second Lien Notes and the Runoff Notes are non-recourse.\nA liquid market for the Runoff Notes may not develop and we do not currently intend to list the Runoff Notes on any national securities exchange or to seek their quotation on any automated dealer quotation system. If any of the Runoff Notes are traded after their initial issuance, they may trade at a discount from the initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, and other factors, including general economic conditions and our financial condition, performance and prospects.\nIn addition, the market for non-investment grade debt securities has historically been subject to disruptions that have caused price volatility independent of the operating and financial performance of the issuers of these securities. It is possible that any market for the Runoff Notes will be subject to these kinds of disruptions. Accordingly, declines in the liquidity and market price of the Runoff Notes may occur independent of operating and financial performance. The Second Lien Notes include certain restrictions on accumulation of 4.75 percent or more of the aggregate principal amount of such notes thereby potentially and significantly limiting a liquid trading market for these notes.\nExcept in very limited circumstances, holders of the Runoff Notes will have no recourse against WMIHC or its subsidiaries for payments due on the Runoff Notes other than against Runoff Proceeds, and there can be no assurance that the runoff proceeds and other recourse assets will be sufficient in amount to cause any unpaid interest and the outstanding principal amount of the Runoff Notes to be paid in full. The Runoff Notes will not be guaranteed by any current or future subsidiaries of WMIHC, including WMMRC, and will be effectively subordinate to the liabilities of WMMRC.", "PERMNO": 81593, "SIC": 6162, "TIC": "COOP"}
