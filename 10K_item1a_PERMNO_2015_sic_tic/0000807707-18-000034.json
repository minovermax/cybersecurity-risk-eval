{"cik": "807707", "company": "VOXX International Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-05-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nWe have identified certain risk factors that apply to us. Each of the following risk factors should be carefully considered, as well as all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. If any of these risks, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe not to be significant, develop into actual events, then our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations could be adversely affected. If that happens, the market price of our common stock would likely decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nThe Automotive, Premium Audio and Consumer Accessories businesses are highly competitive and face significant competition from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and direct imports by our retail customers.\nThe market for mobile electronics, premium audio products and consumer accessories is highly competitive across all product lines. We compete against many established companies, some of whom have substantially greater financial and engineering resources than we do. We compete directly with OEMs, including divisions of well-known automobile manufacturers, in the auto security, mobile video and accessories markets. We believe that OEMs have diversified and improved their product offerings and place increased sales pressure on new car dealers with whom they have close business relationships to purchase OEM-supplied equipment and accessories. To the extent that OEMs succeed in their efforts, this success would have a material adverse effect on our sales of automotive entertainment and security products to new car dealers. In addition, we compete with major retailers who may at any time choose to direct import products that we may currently supply.\nOEM sales are dependent on the economic success of the automotive industry.\nA portion of our OEM sales are to automobile manufacturers. In the past, some domestic OEM manufacturers have reorganized their operations as a result of general economic conditions. There is no guarantee that additional automobile manufacturers will not face similar reorganizations in the future. If additional reorganizations do take place and are not successful, it could have a material adverse effect on a portion of our OEM business.\nSales in our Automotive, Premium Audio and Consumer Accessories businesses are dependent on new products, product development and consumer acceptance.\nOur Automotive, Premium Audio and Consumer Accessories businesses depend, to a large extent, on the introduction and availability of innovative products and technologies. If we are not able to continually introduce new products that achieve consumer acceptance, our sales and profit margins may decline.\nThe impact of future selling prices and technological advancements may cause price erosion and adversely impact our profitability and inventory value.\nSince we do not manufacture all of our products and do not conduct a majority of our own research, we cannot assure you that we will be able to source technologically advanced products in order to remain competitive. Furthermore, the introduction or expected introduction of new products or technologies may depress sales of existing products and technologies. This may result in declining prices and inventory obsolescence. Since we maintain a substantial investment in product inventory, declining prices and inventory obsolescence could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nOur estimates of excess and obsolete inventory may prove to be inaccurate, in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory may be understated or overstated. Although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and operating results.\nA commercial market for biometrics technology is still developing. There can be no assurance our iris-based identity authentication technology will be successful or achieve market acceptance.\nA component of our strategy to grow revenue includes expansion of our iris-based identity authentication solutions into commercial markets. To date, biometrics technology has received only limited acceptance in such markets. Although the recent appearance of biometric readers on popular consumer products, such as smartphones, has increased interest in biometrics as a means of authenticating and/or identifying individuals, commercial markets for biometrics technology are in the process of developing and evolving. Biometrics-based solutions compete with more traditional security methods including keys, cards, personal identification numbers and security personnel. Acceptance of biometrics as an alternative to such traditional methods depends upon a number of factors including:\n\u2022\nthe cost, performance and reliability of our products and services and the products and services offered by our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe continued growth in demand for biometrics solutions within the government and law enforcement markets as well as the development and growth of demand for biometric solutions in markets outside of government and law enforcement;\n\u2022\ncustomers\u2019 perceptions regarding the benefits of biometrics solutions;\n\u2022\npublic perceptions regarding the intrusiveness of these solutions and the manner in which organizations use the biometric information collected;\n\u2022\npublic perceptions regarding the confidentiality of private information;\n\u2022\nproposed or enacted legislation related to privacy of information;\n\u2022\ncustomers\u2019 satisfaction with biometrics solutions; and\n\u2022\nmarketing efforts and publicity regarding biometrics solutions.\nWe face intense competition from other biometrics solutions providers.\nA significant number of established companies have developed or are developing and marketing software and hardware for biometrics products and applications, including facial recognition and fingerprint biometrics, that currently compete with or will compete directly with our iris-based identity authentication solutions. We believe that additional competitors will enter the biometrics market and become significant long-term competitors, and that, as a result, competition will increase. Companies competing with us may introduce solutions that are competitively priced, have increased performance or functionality or incorporate technological advances we have not yet developed or implemented.\nThere is no guarantee that patent/royalty rights will be renewed, or licensing agreements will be maintained.\nCertain product development and revenues are dependent on the ownership and or use of various patents, licenses and license agreements. If the Company is not able to successfully renew or renegotiate these rights, we may suffer from a loss of product sales or royalty revenue associated with these rights or incur additional expense to pursue alternative arrangements.\nA portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions. Collective bargaining agreements can increase our expenses. Labor disruptions could adversely affect our operations.\nAs of February 28, 2018, 38 of our full-time employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We cannot predict whether labor unions may be successful in organizing other portions of our workforce or what additional costs we could incur as a result.\nWe depend on our suppliers to provide us with adequate quantities of high quality competitive products and/or component parts on a timely basis.\nWe have few long-term contracts with our suppliers. Most of our products and component parts are imported from suppliers under short-term purchase orders. Accordingly, we can give no assurance that:\n\u2022\nour supplier relationships will continue as presently in effect;\n\u2022\nour suppliers will be able to obtain the components necessary to produce high-quality, technologically-advanced products for us;\n\u2022\nwe will be able to obtain adequate alternatives to our supply sources, should they be interrupted;\n\u2022\nif obtained, alternatively sourced products of satisfactory quality would be delivered on a timely basis, competitively priced, comparably featured or acceptable to our customers;\n\u2022\nour suppliers have sufficient financial resources to fulfill their obligations;\n\u2022\nour suppliers will be able to obtain raw materials and labor necessary for production;\n\u2022\nshipments from our suppliers will not be affected by labor disputes within the shipping and transportation industries;\n\u2022\nour suppliers could be impacted by natural disasters directly or via their supply chains; and\n\u2022\nas it relates to products we do not manufacture, our suppliers will not become our competitors.\nOn occasion, our suppliers have not been able to produce the quantities of products or component parts that we desire. Our inability to manufacture and/or supply sufficient quantities of products that are in demand could reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our relationships with our customers. If any of our supplier relationships were terminated or interrupted, we could experience an immediate or long-term supply shortage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have few long-term sales contracts with our customers that contain guaranteed customer purchase commitments.\nSales of many of our products are made by purchase orders and are terminable at will by either party. We do have long-term sales contracts with certain customers; however, these contracts do not require the customers to guarantee specific levels of product purchases over the term of the contracts. The unexpected loss of all or a significant portion of sales to any one of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our performance.\nOur success will depend on a less diversified line of business.\nCurrently, we generate substantially all of our sales from the Automotive, Premium Audio and Consumer Accessories businesses. We cannot assure you that we can grow the revenues of our Automotive, Premium Audio and Consumer Accessories businesses or maintain profitability. As a result, the Company's revenues and profitability will depend on our ability to maintain and generate additional customers and develop new products. A reduction in demand for our existing products and services would have a material adverse effect on our business. The sustainability of current levels of our Automotive, Premium Audio and Consumer Accessories businesses and the future growth of such revenues, if any, will depend on, among other factors:\n\u2022\nthe overall performance of the economy and discretionary consumer spending,\n\u2022\ncompetition within key markets,\n\u2022\ncustomer acceptance of newly developed products and services, and\n\u2022\nthe demand for other products and services.\nWe cannot assure you that we will maintain or increase our current level of revenues or profits from the Automotive, Premium Audio and Consumer Accessories businesses in future periods.\nWe depend on a small number of key customers for a large percentage of our sales.\nThe electronics industry is characterized by a number of key customers. Specifically, 26% of our sales from continuing operations were to five customers in Fiscal 2018, 28% in Fiscal 2017, and 29% in Fiscal 2016. The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe plan to continue to expand the international marketing and distribution of our products, which will subject us to risks associated with international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to continue to increase our international sales, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so. Approximately 12% of our net sales from continuing operations currently originate in markets outside the U.S. While geographic diversity helps to reduce the Company's exposure to risk in any one country or part of the world, it also means that we are subject to the full range of risks associated with significant international operations, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nchanges in exchange rates for foreign countries, which may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows we receive from non-U.S. markets or increase our supply costs, as measured in U.S. dollars, in those markets;\n\u2022\nexchange controls and other limits on our ability to import raw materials or finished product or to repatriate earnings from overseas;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability, social or labor unrest or changing macroeconomic conditions in our markets;\n\u2022\nforeign ownership restrictions and the potential for nationalization or expropriation of property or other resources; and\n\u2022\nother foreign or domestic legal and regulatory requirements, including those resulting in potentially adverse tax consequences or other imposition of onerous trade restrictions, price controls or other government controls.\nThese risks could have a significant impact on our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis in international markets and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nIn an effort to reduce the impact on earnings of foreign currency rate movements, we engage in a combination of cost-containment measures and selective hedging of foreign currency transactions. However, these measures may not succeed in offsetting any negative impact of foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations. For example, since 2010, Venezuela\nhas been designated as hyperinflationary and the resulting currency devaluations in Venezuela in that initial year affected our business and results of operations. The government of Venezuela has also devalued its currency several times since 2013, which has also affected our business and results of operations. Going forward, additional government actions, including further currency devaluations, foreign exchange price controls or political and social unrest in Venezuela could have further adverse impacts on the Company.\nSubstantial political and economic uncertainty in Venezuela puts our local assets at risk.\nWe have a subsidiary in Venezuela, whose operations are currently suspended due to the economic and political climate in that country. We hold fixed assets at this subsidiary and have incurred impairment charges related to our long-lived assets in Venezuela in the past. If conditions continue to deteriorate, we may be at risk of additional losses to our capital assets, including further declines in fair value or government confiscation of certain assets.\nConditions in the global economy, the geographic markets we serve, and the financial markets may adversely affect us.\nConcerns persist regarding the lingering effects of the European debt crisis and the ability of certain Eurozone countries to meet future financial obligations; the overall stability of the Euro and the suitability of the Euro as a single currency, given the diverse economic and political circumstances within individual Eurozone countries; and the uncertainty relating to the British Pound Sterling, particularly in light of the United Kingdom's intended exit from the European Union and the uncertainties regarding the terms of such exit. There have also been concerns regarding slower growth in the Chinese economy and other Asian economies, as well as the economic effect of tensions in the relationship between China and surrounding Asian countries. These concerns or market perceptions regarding these and related issues could adversely affect the value of the Company's Euro-denominated assets and obligations. In addition, concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in Europe, China and globally could have an adverse impact on the economy generally, and more specifically on the consumers' demand for our products.\nA decline in general economic conditions could lead to reduced consumer demand for the discretionary products we sell.\nConsumer spending patterns, especially discretionary spending for products such as mobile, consumer and accessory electronics, are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, energy costs, raw material costs, wage rates, inflation, consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions. A general slowdown in the U.S. and certain international economies or an uncertain economic outlook could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results.\nChanges in the retail industry could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.\nIn recent years, the retail industry has experienced consolidation, store closures, bankruptcies and other ownership changes. In the future, retailers in the United States and in foreign markets may further consolidate, undergo restructurings or reorganizations, or realign their affiliations, any of which could decrease the number of stores that carry our products. Changing shopping patterns, including the rapid expansion of online retail shopping, have adversely affected customer traffic in mall and outlet centers. We expect competition in the e-commerce market will intensify. As a greater portion of consumer expenditures with retailers occurs online and through mobile commerce applications, our brick-and-mortar wholesale customers who fail to successfully integrate their physical retail stores and digital retail may experience financial difficulties, including store closures, bankruptcies or liquidations. We cannot control the success of individual malls, and an increase in store closures by other retailers may lead to store vacancies and reduced foot traffic. A continuation or worsening of these trends could have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe purchase a significant amount of our products from suppliers in Pacific Rim countries and we are subject to the economic risks associated with inherent changes in the social, political, regulatory and economic conditions not only in these countries, but also in other countries we do business in, including our own.\nWe import most of our products from suppliers in the Pacific Rim. Countries in the Pacific Rim have experienced significant social, political and economic upheaval over the past several years. Due to the large concentrations of our purchases in Pacific Rim countries, particularly China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia and Taiwan, any adverse changes in the social, political, regulatory and economic conditions in these countries may materially increase the cost of the products that we buy from our foreign suppliers or delay shipments of products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our dependence on foreign suppliers forces us to order products further in advance than we would if our products were manufactured domestically. This increases the risk that our products will become obsolete or face selling price reductions before we can sell our inventory.\nPresident Donald J. Trump and his administration took office in the United States on January 20, 2017. President Trump has expressed apprehension toward existing trade agreements, suggesting renegotiation of The North American Free Trade Agreement and the implementation of tariffs, duties, border taxes or other similar assessments that could impact the level of trade between the U.S. and Mexico. The Trump Administration has also recently introduced tariffs on China, with China imposing retaliatory tariffs on certain products from the United States. President Trump has also publicly stated that he may seek to impose additional tariffs, duties, border taxes or other similar assessments on products imported from China and other countries. In addition, on January 23, 2017, President Trump signed a presidential memorandum to withdraw the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Such tariffs, duties, border taxes or other assessments imposed on the products we import into the United States will increase the total cost of these products and may decrease demand for such products. In addition, we may not be able to fully pass the added cost of such tariffs, taxes, duties or assessments on to our customers, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur stock price could fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly in response to various factors and events, including:\n\u2022\noperating results being below market expectations,\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors,\n\u2022\nloss of a major customer or supplier,\n\u2022\nchanges in, or our failure to meet, financial estimates by securities analysts,\n\u2022\nindustry developments,\n\u2022\neconomic and other external factors,\n\u2022\ngeneral downgrading of our industry sector by securities analysts,\n\u2022\ninventory write-downs, and\n\u2022\nability to integrate acquisitions.\nIn addition, the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations over the past several years that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nWe invest in marketable securities and other investments as part of our investing activities and from time to time, provide additional funding in the form of loans. These investments fluctuate in value based on economic, operational, competitive, political and technological factors. These investments could be subject to loss or impairment based on their performance and loan balances may become uncollectible.\nThe Company has, in the past, incurred other-than-temporary impairments on its investments and continues to monitor its investments in non-controlled corporations for potential future impairments. In addition, there is no guarantee that the fair values recorded for other investments will be sustained in the future. From time to time, the Company may also provide additional funding to investees in the form of loans, which are collateralized. Should the borrowers default on the loans and should the collateral be insufficient to satisfy the total outstanding balance owed to Voxx, we may not be able to recover 100% of these loan balances.\nWe are subject to governmental regulations.\nWe always face the possibility of new governmental regulations which could have a substantial effect on our operations and profitability. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. There are costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for due diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. These rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \"conflict free\" conflict minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement.\nThe recently passed comprehensive tax reform bill could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"). The TCJA contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%,\nadditional limitation on the tax deduction for interest expense and executive compensation, accelerates business asset expensing, eliminates net operating loss carrybacks, and makes significant changes to the taxation of foreign earnings including the imposition of a one-time repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated and imposes a minimum tax on global intangible low tax income (\u201cGILTI\u201d). At this stage, it is unclear how many U.S. states will incorporate these federal tax law changes or portions thereof into their tax codes. Further, our effective tax rate may fluctuate as a result of the TCJA in future reporting periods.\nWe continue to examine the impact these changes may have on our business. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the TCJA is uncertain, and our results of operations, cash flows and financial conditions, as well as the trading price of our Common Stock, could be adversely affected.\nWe are increasingly dependent on the continuous and reliable operation of our information technology systems, and a disruption of these systems, resulting from cyber security attacks or other events, could adversely affect our business.\nWe increasingly depend on our information technology, or IT, infrastructure in order to achieve our business objectives. If we experience a problem that impairs this infrastructure, such as a computer virus, a problem with the functioning of an important IT application, or an intentional disruption of our IT systems by a third party, the resulting disruptions could impede our ability to record or process orders, manufacture and ship in a timely manner, or otherwise carry on our business in the ordinary course. Any such events could cause us to lose customers or revenue and could require us to incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns.\nComputer viruses, malware, and other \u201chacking\u201d programs and devices may cause significant damage, delays or interruptions to our systems and operations or to certain of the products we sell, resulting in damage to our reputation and brand names. They may also attack our infrastructure, industrial machinery, software or hardware causing significant damage, delays or other service interruptions to our systems and operations. \u201cHacking\u201d involves efforts to gain unauthorized access to information or systems or to cause intentional malfunctions, loss or corruption of data, software, hardware or other computer equipment. In addition, increasingly sophisticated malware may target real-world infrastructure or product components, including certain of the products that we currently or may in the future sell by attacking, disrupting, reconfiguring and/or reprogramming industrial control software. We may incur significant costs to protect our systems and equipment against the threat of, and to repair any damage caused by, computer viruses and hacking. Moreover, if a computer virus or hacking affects our systems or products, our reputation and brand names could be materially damaged and use of our products may decrease.\nA data privacy breach or failure to comply with data privacy laws could damage our reputation and customer relationships, expose us to litigation risk and potential fines and adversely affect our business.\nAs part of our normal operations, we collect, process, transmit and where appropriate, retain certain confidential employee and customer information, including credit card information. There is significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information, consumer identity theft and user privacy. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, cyber-attacks, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. As a result of recent security breaches at a number of prominent companies, the media and public scrutiny of information security and privacy has become more intense and the regulatory environment has become more uncertain. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, whether by us or our vendors, could result in significant legal and remediation expenses, severely damage our reputation and our customer relationships, harm sales, expose us to risks of litigation and liability and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, changing privacy laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, including the adoption by the European Union of the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which becomes effective May 2018, creates new individual privacy rights and imposes increased obligations on companies handling personal data. Consequently, we may incur significant costs related to prevention and to comply with laws regarding the protection and unauthorized disclosure of personal information. A failure to comply with the stringent rules of the GDPR could result in fines of up to \u20ac20 million.\nWe are responsible for product warranties and defects.\nWhether we outsource manufacturing or manufacture products directly for our customers, we provide warranties for all of our products for which we have provided an estimated liability. Therefore, we are highly dependent on the quality of our suppliers\u2019 products.\nIf we experience an increase in warranty claims, or if our costs associated with such warranty claims increase significantly, we will begin to incur liabilities for potential warranty claims after the sale of our products at levels that we have not previously\nincurred or anticipated. In addition, an increase in the frequency of our warranty claims or amount of warranty costs may harm our reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must comply with restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.\nOur existing debt agreements contain a number of covenants, which limit our ability to, among other things, borrow additional money, pay dividends, dispose of assets and acquire new businesses. These covenants also require us to maintain a specified fixed charge coverage ratio. If the Company is unable to comply with these covenants, there would be a default under these debt agreements, should we have debt outstanding. Changes in economic or business conditions, results of operations or other factors could cause the Company to default under its debt agreements. A default, if not waived by our lenders, could result in acceleration of our debt and possible bankruptcy.\nWe may be unable to collect amounts owed to us by our customers.\nWe typically grant our customers credit on a short-term basis. Related credit risks are inherent as we do not typically collateralize receivables due from customers. We provide estimates for uncollectible accounts based primarily on our judgment using historical losses, current economic conditions and individual evaluations of each customer as evidence supporting the receivables valuations stated on our financial statements. However, our receivables valuation estimates may not be accurate and receivables due from customers reflected in our financial statements may not be collectible. Our inability to perform under our contractual obligations, or our customers\u2019 inability or unwillingness to fulfill their contractual commitments to us, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe provide financial support to one of our subsidiaries through an intercompany loan agreement and may need to secure additional financing for our own operations, but we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available.\nWe have entered into intercompany loan agreements with our majority owned subsidiary, EyeLock LLC, which is expected to continue to require additional funding beyond one year. In funding the loans to EyeLock LLC, we have less cash flow available to support our domestic operations and other activities. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows in the future to support our operations and service our debt as a result of funding EyeLock LLC, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt, as applicable, or to obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that any refinancing will be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on acceptable terms. The inability to service or refinance our existing debt or to obtain additional financing would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, and results of operations.\nOur capital resources may not be sufficient to meet our future capital and liquidity requirements.\nWe believe our current funds and available credit lines would provide sufficient resources to fund our existing operations for the foreseeable future. However, we may need additional capital to operate our business if:\n\u2022\nmarket conditions change,\n\u2022\nour business plans or assumptions change,\n\u2022\nwe make significant acquisitions,\n\u2022\nwe need to make significant increases in capital expenditures or working capital,\n\u2022\nour restrictive covenants do not provide sufficient credit, or\n\u2022\nwe need to continue to provide financial support to EyeLock LLC for an extended period of time.\nWe have recorded, or may record in the future, goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions, and changes in future business conditions could cause these investments to become impaired, requiring substantial write-downs that would reduce our operating income.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill and other intangible asset amounts annually, or when evidence of potential impairment exists. The annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Changes in our operating performance, business conditions, or restrictions on our field of use resulted in an impairment of certain intangible assets in Fiscal 2016, and could result in additional future impairments, which could be material to our results of operations.\nOur cash and cash equivalents could be adversely affected if the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and cash equivalents fail.\nOur cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and highly liquid money market funds with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. We maintain the cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions. Some deposits with these banks exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") insurance limits or similar limits in foreign jurisdictions. While we monitor daily the cash balances in the operating accounts and adjust the balances as appropriate, these balances could be impacted if one or more of the financial institutions with which we deposit fails or is subject to other adverse conditions in the financial or credit markets. To date, we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents; however, we can provide no assurance that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial and credit markets.\nIf our sales during the holiday season fall below our expectations, our annual results could also fall below expectations.\nSeasonal consumer shopping patterns significantly affect our business. We generally make a substantial amount of our sales and net income during September, October and November. We expect this trend to continue. December is also a key month for us, due largely to the increase in promotional activities by our customers during the holiday season. If the economy faltered in these periods, if our customers altered the timing or frequency of their promotional activities or if the effectiveness of these promotional activities declined, particularly around the holiday season, it could have a material adverse effect on our annual financial results.\nOur business could be affected by weather-related factors.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by weather-related factors. Severe winter weather conditions may deter or prevent patrons from reaching facilities where our products are sold. Although our budget assumes certain seasonal fluctuations in our revenues to ensure adequate cash flow during expected periods of lower revenues, we cannot ensure that weather-related factors will not have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur products could infringe the intellectual property rights of others and we may be exposed to costly litigation.\nThe products we sell are continually changing as a result of improved technology. Although we and our suppliers attempt to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties in our products, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims for alleged infringement by us, our suppliers or our distributors, or of a third party\u2019s patents, trade secrets, trademarks or copyrights.\nAny claims relating to the infringement of third-party proprietary rights, even if not meritorious, could result in costly litigation, divert management\u2019s attention and resources, or require us to either enter into royalty or license agreements which are not advantageous to us or pay material amounts of damages. In addition, parties making these claims may be able to obtain an injunction, which could prevent us from selling our products. We may increasingly be subject to infringement claims as we expand our product offerings.\nAcquisitions and strategic investments may divert our resources and management attention; results may fall short of expectations.\nWe intend to continue pursuing selected acquisitions of and investments in businesses, technologies and product lines as a key component of our growth strategy. Any future acquisition or investment may result in the use of significant amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, or the incurrence of debt and amortization expenses related to intangible assets. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration and assimilation of the operations, technologies, products and personnel of an acquired business;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nincreased expenses associated with the acquisition, and\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees or customers of any acquired business.\nWe cannot assure you that our acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe depend heavily on existing directors, management and key personnel and our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel.\nOur success depends on the continued efforts of our directors, executives and senior vice presidents, many of whom have worked with VOXX International Corporation for several decades, as well as our other executive officers and key employees. We have employment contracts with most of our executive officers. The loss or interruption of the continued full-time service of certain of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, to support our continued growth, we must effectively recruit, develop and retain additional qualified personnel both domestically and internationally. Our inability to attract and retain necessary qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nJohn J. Shalam, our Chairman, controls a significant portion of the voting power of our common stock and can exercise control over our affairs.\nMr. Shalam beneficially owns approximately 52% of the combined voting power of both classes of common stock. This will allow him to elect the majority of our Board of Directors and, in general, determine the outcome of any other matter submitted to the stockholders for approval. Mr. Shalam's voting power may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company.\nWe have two classes of common stock: Class A common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol VOXX and Class B common stock, which is not publicly traded and substantially all of which is beneficially owned by Mr. Shalam. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share and each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes per share. Class A shareholders vote separately for the election/removal of the Class A directors, while both classes vote together as a single class on all other matters and as otherwise may be required by Delaware law. Since our charter permits shareholder action by written consent, Mr. Shalam may be able to take significant corporate actions without prior notice and a shareholder meeting.\nWe exercise our option for the \"controlled company\" exemption under NASDAQ rules.\nThe Company has exercised its right to the \"controlled company\" exemption under NASDAQ rules which enables us to forego certain NASDAQ requirements which include: (i) maintaining a majority of independent directors; (ii) electing a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors; (iii) ensuring the compensation of our executive officers is determined by a majority of independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors; and (iv) selecting, or recommending for the Board's selection, director nominees, either by a majority of the independent directors or a nominating committee composed solely of independent directors. Although we do not maintain a nominating committee and do not have a majority of independent directors, the Company notes that at the present time we do maintain a compensation committee comprised solely of independent directors who approve executive compensation, and the recommendations for director nominees are governed by a majority of independent directors. However, election of the \"controlled company\" exemption under NASDAQ rules allows us to modify our position at any time.\nOther Risks\nOther risks and uncertainties include:\n\u2022\nadditional changes in U.S. federal, state and local law,\n\u2022\nour ability to implement operating cost structures that align with revenue growth,\n\u2022\nadditional trade sanctions against or for foreign countries,\n\u2022\nsuccessful integration of business acquisitions and new brands in our distribution network,\n\u2022\ncompliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and\n\u2022\ncompliance with complex financial accounting and tax standards, both foreign and domestic.", "PERMNO": 75033, "SIC": 3651, "TIC": "VOXX"}
