{"cik": "40570", "company": "GEE Group Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-12-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWE HAVE EXPERIENCED LOSSES FROM OPERATIONS IN THE PAST AND MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE IN THE FUTURE.\nThe Company has experienced net losses in certain of its recent fiscal years. Possible consequences of recurring net losses include, but are not limited to, negative cash flows, asset impairments, defaults under the Company\u2019s debt agreements, and possibly, the inability of the Company to continue operating as a going concern. Among the consequences of the net losses experienced, the Company was required to obtain amendments and waivers for missed covenants under its former senior revolving credit, term loan and security agreement. Management has taken definitive actions to improve operations, reduce costs, improve operating profitability, and position the Company for future growth. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had extinguished all of its former senior and subordinated debt and mezzanine preferred stock financing totaling over $100 million, in aggregate, reduced its interest expense and fees by approximately $12 million annually, and thereby improved its net cash flow and overall financial profile. However, other risk factors, including those described elsewhere herein and which include some risks that are outside the Company\u2019s control, could also cause the Company to experience net losses in the future.\nTHE TERMS OF OUR SENIOR BANK ASSET BACKED LOAN AGREEMENT MAY PLACE SOME RESTRICTIONS ON OUR OPERATING AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY, AND FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH COVENANTS OR TO SATISFY CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF THE AGREEMENT MAY RESULT IN ACCELERATION OF OUR REPAYMENT OBLIGATIONS, WHICH COULD HARM OUR LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION, OPERATING RESULTS, BUSINESS AND PROSPECTS AND CAUSE THE PRICE OF OUR SECURITIES TO DECLINE.\nGEE Group Inc. and its subsidiaries, Agile Resources, Inc., Access Data Consulting Corporation, BMCH, Inc., GEE Group Portfolio, Inc., Paladin Consulting, Inc., Scribe Solutions, Inc., SNI Companies, Inc., Triad Personnel Services, Inc., and Triad Logistics, Inc. are co-borrowers under a Loan, Security and Guaranty Agreement for a $20 million asset-based senior secured revolving credit facility with CIT Bank, N.A. (the \u201cCIT Facility\u201d). The CIT Facility is collateralized by 100% of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries who are co-borrowers and/or guarantors. The CIT Facility matures on the fifth anniversary of the closing date (May 14, 2026). The CIT Facility contains some restrictions and limitations that might inhibit our ability to engage in certain activities and transactions that may otherwise be in our long-term best interests. The affirmative and negative covenants contained in the Credit Agreement that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business include covenants that limit and restrict, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, transfer or sell certain assets, issue stock of subsidiaries, pay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions with respect to our capital stock or make other restricted payments, incur or permit liens or other encumbrances on assets, make certain investments, loans and advances, acquire other businesses, merge, consolidate, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets, enter into certain transactions with our affiliates and amend certain agreements, without amendment of the CIT facility or the express approval of CIT Bank. Under the CIT Facility, advances are subject to a borrowing base formula based on 85% of eligible accounts receivable of the Company and subsidiaries, as defined, and subject to certain other criteria, conditions, and applicable reserves, including any additional eligibility requirements as determined by the administrative agent. Although the stated face amount of the CIT Facility is $20 million, the borrowing base formula significantly limits amounts available for us to borrow.\nThe CIT Facility also contains customary events of default, including, among others, payment default, bankruptcy events, cross-default, breaches of covenants and representations and warranties, change of control and judgment defaults. A breach of any of these covenants could result in default under our Credit Agreement, which could prompt the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. In addition, a breach of the Credit Agreement would cause a cross-default of certain other indebtedness. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. If the lenders under the Credit Agreement accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot ensure that we will have sufficient assets and funds to repay the borrowings under the Credit Agreement and our other indebtedness. An acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness could have serious consequences to our financial condition, operating results, and business, and could cause us to become insolvent or enter bankruptcy proceedings.\nRECENT GLOBAL SOCIOECONOMIC TRENDS, INCLUDING THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC, CARES ACT REQUIREMENTS, AND TRENDS IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.\nRecent global socioeconomic conditions, including the negative effects of the Coronavirus Pandemic (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), and disruption of financial markets, severely affected our business and results of operations during fiscal 2020 and, although to a lesser extent, fiscal 2021. The negative effects initially limited our access to credit or equity capital, our ability to refinance debt and disrupted ours and our clients\u2019 businesses. In fiscal 2021, we were able to regain reasonable access to credit and equity capital markets, but did continue to experience some disruptions in our business operations in certain markets.\nDue to these disruptions, the operations and liquidity of our operating subsidiaries were negatively impacted by COVID-19, and as a result and out of necessity, in fiscal 2020, we were able to obtain financial relief in the form of funds received in exchange for promissory notes issued by the U.S. Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) and U.S. Treasury under the Payroll Protection Program of the CARES Act (\u201cPPP loans\u201d). The nine (9) promissory notes had an aggregate face amount of $19.9 million, with interest at 1% per annum and are unsecured. The CARES Act PPP loans and related accrued interest are eligible for forgiveness by the SBA, in whole or in part, based upon the usage of the proceeds for costs and expenses determined by the SBA to be allowable and eligible. Allowable costs and expenses, as defined by the SBA, broadly include payroll and certain payroll related expenses, lease costs, utilities, and interest on business mortgage loans. Allowable costs and expenses that are eligible for forgiveness include those incurred during the covered periods, as defined, after certain specified limitations and reductions based on changes in compensation and headcount levels during the covered periods, as defined.\nAll nine of the Company\u2019s operating subsidiaries (the Company and 8 of its operating subsidiaries) applied for forgiveness of their respective PPP loans having incurred adequate allowable expenses eligible for the use of loan proceeds and forgiveness, accordingly. Five (5) of the Company\u2019s operating subsidiaries: Scribe Solutions, Inc., Triad Logistics, Inc., Access Data Consulting Corporation, Agile Resources, Inc., and Triad Personnel Services, Inc. had been fully forgiven by the SBA through September 30, 2021. On December 14, 2021, the Company received formal notification that the remaining four (4) operating subsidiaries\u2019 PPP loans were fully forgiven by the SBA, including 100% of their respective outstanding principal and interest. The outstanding principal and accrued interest balances of these remaining PPP loans, one each for GEE Group Inc., BMCH, Inc., Paladin Consulting, Inc., and SNI Companies, Inc., in the aggregate amount of $16.7 million, are included in the Company\u2019s current liabilities as of September 30, 2021, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The forgiveness of these four loans will be recorded in the Company\u2019s first fiscal quarter of the 2022 fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, by eliminating them from the consolidated balance sheet with corresponding gains in income.\nThe PPP loans obtained by GEE Group Inc., as a public company, and some of its operating subsidiaries, together as an affiliated group, have exceeded the $2 million audit threshold established by the SBA, and therefore, also will be subject to audit by the SBA in the future. If any of the nine forgiven PPP loans are reinstated in whole or in part as the result of a future audit, a charge or charges would be incurred, accordingly, and they would need to be repaid. If the companies are unable to repay the portions of their PPP loans that ultimately might be reinstated from available liquidity or operating cash flow, they may be required to raise additional equity or debt capital to repay the PPP loans.\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO GENERATE OR BORROW SUFFICIENT CASH TO MAKE PAYMENTS ON OUR INDEBTEDNESS OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION WOULD BE MATERIALLY HARMED, OUR BUSINESS COULD FAIL AND OUR SHAREHOLDERS MAY LOSE ALL OF THEIR INVESTMENT.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which will be affected by economic, financial, competitive, business, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. While we believe we will be able to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future and for at least the next twelve months, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to meet our debt obligations or fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to restructure or refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, which could cause us to default on our debt obligations and impair our liquidity. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations.\nTHE COMPANY HAS MATERIAL INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING GOODWILL, CUSTOMER LISTS, TRADEMARKS AND TRADENAMES. THESE ASSETS ARE SUBJECT TO IMPAIRMENT RISKS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN FUTURE MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES TO INCOME AND NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE COMPANY.\nThe Company is required to evaluate its goodwill annually or when one or more triggering events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. The other long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, have to be tested for impairment only when triggering events occur or circumstances indicate that these assets might be impaired. As a result, the Company recognized a significant impairment of its goodwill in fiscal 2020. In testing for impairments, management applies one or more valuation techniques to estimate the fair values of the reporting units, individual assets or groups of individual assets, as required under the circumstances. These valuation techniques rely on assumptions and other factors, such as the estimated future cash flows, the discount rates used to determine the present value of associated cash flows, and the market comparable assumptions. Changes to input assumptions and other factors used or considered in the analysis could result in materially different evaluations of impairment.\nThe valuation techniques utilized by management, for impairment testing, including estimated future cash flows, fundamentally include the inherent underlying assumption that the economy, the markets served by the Company, and the Company itself, will continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic in fiscal 2022 and beyond. In the event the assumptions relied upon by management are not achieved, including assumed future growth rates as a result of the prolonged impact of COVID-19 pandemic, impairments of goodwill or other long-lived assets could be recorded and such amounts could be material to the financial statements. A reduction in the projected long-term operating performance of one or both of the Company\u2019s reporting units or other long-lived assets, future market declines, changes in discount rates or other conditions also could result in material impairments in the future. Thus, there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s goodwill or other long-lived assets will not become impaired in the future.\nWE HAVE SIGNIFICANT WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO SATISFY THOSE NEEDS FROM CASH GENERATED FROM OUR OPERATIONS OR BORROWINGS UNDER OUR DEBT INSTRUMENTS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CONTINUE OUR OPERATIONS.\nWe require significant amounts of working capital to operate our business. We often have high receivables from our customers, and as a staffing company, we are prone to cash flow imbalances because we have to fund payroll payments to temporary workers before receiving payments from clients for our services. Cash flow imbalances also occur because we must pay temporary workers even when we have not been paid by our customers. If we experience a significant and sustained drop in operating profits, or if there are unanticipated reductions in cash inflows or increases in cash outlays, we may be subject to cash shortfalls. If such a shortfall were to occur for even a brief period of time, it may have a significant adverse effect on our business. In particular, we use working capital to pay expenses relating to our temporary workers and to satisfy our workers\u2019 compensation liabilities. As a result, we must maintain sufficient cash availability to pay temporary workers and fund related tax liabilities prior to receiving payment from customers.\nIn addition, our operating results tend to be unpredictable from quarter to quarter. Demand for our services is typically lower during traditional national vacation periods in the United States when customers and candidates are on vacation. No single quarter is predictive of results of future periods. Any extended period of time with low operating results or cash flow imbalances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe derive working capital for our operations through cash generated by our operating activities and borrowings under our debt instruments. If our working capital needs increase in the future, we may be forced to seek additional sources of capital, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The amount we are entitled to borrow under our debt instruments is calculated monthly based on the aggregate value of certain eligible trade accounts receivable generated from our operations, which are affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, as well as by the daily timing of cash collections and cash outflows. The aggregate value of our eligible accounts receivable may not be adequate to allow for borrowings for other corporate purposes, such as capital expenditures or growth opportunities, which could reduce our ability to react to changes in the market or industry conditions.\nOUR REVENUE CAN VARY BECAUSE OUR CUSTOMERS CAN TERMINATE THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US AT ANY TIME WITH LIMITED OR NO PENALTY.\nWe focus on providing mid-level professionals and light industrial personnel on a temporary assignment-by-assignment basis, which customers can generally terminate at any time or reduce their level of use when compared to prior periods. To avoid large placement agency fees, large companies may use in-house personnel staff, current employee referrals, or human resources consulting companies to find and hire new personnel. Because placement agencies typically charges fees as a mark-up to the hourly pay rate or based on a percentage of the first year\u2019s salary of a new worker, companies with many jobs to fill have a large financial incentive to avoid agencies.\nOur business is also significantly affected by our customers\u2019 hiring needs and their views of their future prospects. Our customers may, on very short notice, terminate, reduce or postpone their recruiting assignments with us and, therefore, affect demand for our services. As a result, a significant number of our customers can terminate their agreements with us at any time, making us particularly vulnerable to a significant decrease in revenue within a short period of time that could be difficult to quickly replace. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMOST OF OUR CONTRACTS DO NOT OBLIGATE OUR CUSTOMERS TO UTILIZE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR STAFFING SERVICES AND MAY BE CANCELLED ON LIMITED NOTICE, SO OUR REVENUE STREAM MAY BE INCONSISTENT AND IS NOT GUARANTEED.\nSubstantially all of our revenue is derived from multi-year contracts that are terminable for convenience of the customer. Under our multi-year agreements, we contract to provide customers with staffing services through work or service orders at the customers\u2019 request. Under these agreements, our customers often have little or no obligation to request our staffing services. In addition, most of our contracts are cancellable on limited notice, even if we are not in default under the contract. We may hire employees permanently to meet anticipated demand for services under these agreements that may ultimately be delayed or cancelled. We could face a significant decline in revenues and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected if:\n\u00b7\nwe see a significant decline in the staffing services requested from us under our service agreements; or\n\u00b7\nour customers cancel or defer a significant number of staffing requests; or our existing customer agreements expire or lapse and we cannot replace them with similar agreements.\nIF WE ARE UNABLE TO RETAIN A BROAD GROUP OF EXISTING CUSTOMERS, LOSE ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS, OR FAIL TO ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD SUFFER.\nIncreasing the growth and profitability of our business is particularly dependent upon our ability to retain existing customers and capture additional customers. Our ability to do so is dependent upon our ability to provide high quality services and offer competitive prices. If we are unable to execute these tasks effectively, we may not be able to attract a significant number of new customers and our existing customer base could decrease, including the loss of a significant customer, either or all of which could have an adverse impact on our revenues.\nSUBSTANTIAL ALTERATION OF OUR CURRENT BUSINESS AND REVENUE MODEL COULD HURT SHORT-TERM RESULTS.\nOur present business and revenue model represents the current view of the optimal business and revenue structure, which is to derive revenues and achieve profitability in the shortest period. There can be no assurance that current models will not be altered significantly or replaced with an alternative model that is driven by motivations other than near-term revenues and/or profitability (for example, building market share before our competitors). Any such alteration or replacement of our current business and revenue model may ultimately result in the deferring of certain revenues in favor of potentially establishing larger market share. We cannot assure that any adjustment or change in the business and revenue model would prove to be successful whether adopted in response to industry changes or for other reasons.\nWE DEPEND ON OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM AND THE LOSS OF ONE OR MORE KEY EMPLOYEES OR AN INABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN HIGHLY SKILLED EMPLOYEES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our executive officers. We rely on our leadership team for research and development, marketing, sales, services, and general and administrative functions, and on mission-critical individual contributors. From time to time, our executive management team may change from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business. We do not have employment agreements with our executive officers or other key personnel that require them to continue to work for us for any specified period; therefore, they could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our executive officers or key employees (including any limitation on the performance of their duties or short term or long-term absences as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic) could have a serious adverse effect on our business.\nTo execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for experienced software engineers and senior sales executives. If we are unable to attract such personnel in cities where we are located, we may need to hire in other locations, which may add to the complexity and costs of our business operations. We expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. Extended stay-at-home, business closure, and other restrictive orders may impact our ability to identify, hire, and train new personnel. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources. In addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the stock awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our stock awards declines, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, it could adversely affect our business and future growth prospects.\nWE DEPEND ON ATTRACTING, INTEGRATING, MANAGING, AND RETAINING QUALIFIED PERSONNEL.\nOur success depends upon our ability to attract, integrate, manage and retain personnel who possess the skills and experience necessary to fulfill our clients\u2019 needs. Our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel could be impaired by any diminution of our reputation, decrease in compensation levels relative to our competitors or modifications to our total compensation philosophy or competitor hiring programs. If we cannot attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be negatively impacted. Our future success also depends upon our ability to manage the performance of our personnel. Failure to successfully manage the performance of our personnel could affect our profitability by causing operating inefficiencies that could increase operating expenses and reduce operating income.\nWE DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED TEMPORARY WORKERS.\nIn addition to the members of our own team, our success is substantially dependent on our ability to recruit and retain large numbers of qualified temporary workers who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the staffing requirements of our customers. We are required to continually evaluate our base of available qualified personnel to keep pace with changing customer needs. Competition for individuals with proven professional skills is intense, and demand for these individuals is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future.\nSince the onset of the COIVD-19 pandemic, the U.S. workforce has not yet fully recovered to employment levels prior to the pandemic. It is presently estimated by some that as many as 11 million former employees that left the U.S. workforce during the pandemic, have not yet re-entered the workforce, or may have re-entered the workforce temporarily. The later volatility in employment, referred to in the media as the \u201cbig resignation,\u201d has created challenge to the Company\u2019s and other U.S. staffing firms\u2019 ability to fill placement orders from clients. It is uncertain as of now as to how this trend will ultimately unfold. There can be no assurance that qualified personnel will continue to be available.\nWE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WITH OUR EXISTING AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS.\nCompetition in the market for placement and staffing services is intense. The Company faces competition from many larger, more established companies. In addition, other companies could seek to introduce competing services and increased competition could result in a decrease in the price charged by the Company\u2019s competitors for their services and reduce demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully with its existing or potential competitors, which may have substantially greater financial, technical, and marketing resources, longer operating histories, greater name recognition or more established relationships in the industry than the Company. If any of these competitors provides competitive services to the marketplace in the future, the Company cannot be sure that it will have the resources or expertise to compete successfully.\nWE OPERATE IN AN INTENSELY COMPETITIVE AND RAPIDLY CHANGING BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, AND THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL RISK THAT OUR SERVICES COULD BECOME OBSOLETE OR UNCOMPETITIVE.\nThe markets for our services are highly competitive. Our markets are characterized by pressures to provide high levels of service, incorporate new capabilities and technologies, accelerate job completion schedules and reduce prices. Furthermore, we face competition from a number of sources, including other executive search firms and professional search, staffing and consulting firms. Several of our competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. New and existing competitors are aided by technology, and the market has low barriers to entry. Furthermore, Internet employment sites expand a company\u2019s ability to find workers without the help of traditional agencies. Personnel agencies often work as intermediaries, helping employers accurately describe job openings and screen candidates. Increasing the use of sophisticated, automated job description and candidate screening tools could make many traditional functions of staffing companies obsolete. Specifically, the increased use of the internet may attract technology-oriented companies to the professional staffing industry. Free social networking sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook are also becoming a common way for recruiters and employees to connect without the assistance of a staffing company.\nOur future success will depend largely upon our ability to anticipate and keep pace with those developments and advances. Current or future competitors could develop alternative capabilities and technologies that are more effective, easier to use or more economical than our services. In addition, we believe that, with continuing development and increased availability of IT, the industries in which we compete may attract new competitors. If our capabilities and technologies become obsolete or uncompetitive, our related sales and revenue would decrease. Due to competition, we may experience reduced margins on our services, loss of market share, and loss of customers. If we are not able to compete effectively with current or future competitors as a result of these and other factors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nCHANGES IN GOVERNMENT REGULATION COULD LIMIT OUR GROWTH OR RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS.\nWe are subject to the same federal, state, and local laws as other companies conducting placement and staffing services, which are extensive. The adoption or modification of laws that affect the placement and staffing industry, including but not limited to, Federal and state laws and regulations pertaining to labor and minimum wages, workplace standards and safety, workers compensation laws, independent contractor status, the Family Medical Leave Act, Affordable Care Act, and others could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition by increasing our costs and administrative burdens.\nWE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO OBTAIN THE NECESSARY ADDITIONAL FINANCING TO ACHIEVE OUR STRATEGIC GOALS.\nThere is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain any additional financing that may be required to continue to expand our business. Our continued viability depends on our ability to raise capital. Changes in economic, regulatory or competitive conditions may lead to cost increases. Management may also determine that it is in our best interest to expand more rapidly than currently intended, to expand marketing activities, to develop new or enhance existing services or products, to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary services, businesses or technologies. In any such case or other change of circumstance, additional financing will be necessary. If any additional financing is required, there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain such additional financing on terms acceptable to us and at times required by us, if at all. In such event, we may be required to materially alter our business plan or curtail all or a part of our expansion plans.\nWE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MANAGE EXPECTED GROWTH AND INTERNAL EXPANSION.\nOur inability to manage growth could hurt our results of operations. Expansion of our operations will be required to address anticipated growth of our customer base and market opportunities. Expansion will place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources. We will need to enhance existing procedures and controls as well as implement new transaction processing, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls to expand, train and manage our employee base. Our failure to manage growth effectively could have a damaging effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWE ARE DEPENDENT UPON TECHNOLOGY SERVICES, AND IF WE EXPERIENCE DAMAGE, SERVICE INTERRUPTIONS OR FAILURES IN OUR COMPUTER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS, OUR EXISTING CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS AND OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT NEW CUSTOMERS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.\nOur business could be interrupted by damage to or disruption of our computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems, and we may lose data. Our customers\u2019 businesses may be adversely affected by any system or equipment failure we experience. As a result of any of the foregoing, our relationships with our customers may be impaired, we may lose customers, our ability to attract new customers may be adversely affected and we could be exposed to contractual liability. Precautions in place to protect us from, or minimize the effect of, such events may not be adequate. If an interruption by damage to or disruption of our computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems occurs, we could be liable and the market perception of our services could be harmed.\nWE COULD BE HARMED BY IMPROPER DISCLOSURE OR LOSS OF SENSITIVE OR CONFIDENTIAL COMPANY, EMPLOYEE, ASSOCIATE OR CLIENT DATA, INCLUDING PERSONAL DATA, BY EMPLOYEE ERROR AND/OR CYBER RISKS.\nIn connection with the operation of our business, we store, process and transmit a large amount of data, including personnel and payment information, about our employees, clients, associates and candidates, a portion of which is confidential and/or personally sensitive. In doing so, we rely on our own technology and systems, and those of third-party vendors we use for a variety of processes. We and our third-party vendors have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information. Unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive or confidential data may occur through a variety of methods. These include, but are not limited to, systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our employees or third parties, including a cyberattack by computer programmers, hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations, who may develop and deploy viruses, worms or other malicious software programs.\nSuch disclosure, loss or breach could harm our reputation and subject us to government sanctions and liability under our contracts and laws that protect sensitive or personal data and confidential information, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues. It is possible that security controls over sensitive or confidential data and other practices we and our third-party vendors follow may not prevent the improper access to, disclosure of, or loss of such information. The potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks may increase as we introduce new services and offerings, such as mobile technology. Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions in which we provide services. Any failure or perceived failure to successfully manage the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, or any failure to comply with changing regulatory requirements in this area, could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace.\nOUR STRATEGY OF GROWING THROUGH ACQUISITIONS MAY BE IMPEDED BY A LACK OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND IMPACT OUR BUSINESS IN UNEXPECTED WAYS. WE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ACQUISITIONS.\nWe intend to expand our business through acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, services or products, subject to our business plans and management\u2019s ability to identify, acquire and develop suitable acquisition or investment targets in both new and existing service categories. In certain circumstances, acceptable acquisition or investment targets might not be available. Acquisitions involve a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of an acquired business, including consolidating redundant facilities and infrastructure;\n\u00b7\npotential disruption of our ongoing business and the distraction of management from our day-to-day operations;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience and in which competitors have a stronger market position;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty maintaining the quality of services that such acquired companies have historically provided;\n\u00b7\nimpact of liabilities of the acquired businesses undiscovered or underestimated as part of the acquisition due diligence;\n\u00b7\nfailure to realize anticipated growth opportunities from a combined business, because existing and potential clients may be unwilling to consolidate business with a single supplier or to stay with the acquirer post acquisition;\n\u00b7\nimpacts of cash on hand and debt incurred to finance acquisitions, thus reducing liquidity for other significant strategic objectives;\n\u00b7\ninternal controls, disclosure controls, corruption prevention policies, human resources and other key policies and practices of the acquired companies may be inadequate or ineffective;\n\u00b7\noverpayment for the acquired company or assets or failure to achieve anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements;\n\u00b7\nincreased expenses associated with completing an acquisition and amortizing any acquired intangible assets;\n\u00b7\nchallenges in implementing uniform standards, accounting policies, customs, controls, procedures and policies throughout an acquired business;\n\u00b7\nfailure to retain, motivate and integrate key management and other employees of the acquired business; and\n\u00b7\nloss of customers and a failure to integrate customer bases.\nIn addition, if we incur indebtedness to finance an acquisition, it may reduce our capacity to borrow additional amounts and requiring us to dedicate a greater percentage of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the cash resources available to us to fund capital expenditures, pursue other acquisitions or investments in new business initiatives and meet general corporate and working capital needs. This increased indebtedness may also limit our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in or challenges relating to our business and industry.\nThe use of our common stock or other securities (including those that might be convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for our common stock) to finance any such acquisition may also result in dilution of our existing shareholders.\nThe potential risks associated with recent and future acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business, result in the loss of key customers or personnel, increase expenses and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWE MAY BE EXPOSED TO EMPLOYMENT-RELATED CLAIMS AND LOSSES, INCLUDING CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.\nWe employ people internally and in the workplaces of other businesses. Many of these individuals have access to client information systems and confidential information. The risks of these activities include possible claims relating to:\n\u00b7\ndiscrimination and harassment;\n\u00b7\nwrongful termination or denial of employment;\n\u00b7\nviolations of employment rights related to employment screening or privacy issues;\n\u00b7\nclassification of temporary workers;\n\u00b7\nassignment of illegal aliens;\n\u00b7\nviolations of wage and hour requirements;\n\u00b7\nretroactive entitlement to temporary worker benefits;\n\u00b7\nerrors and omissions by our temporary workers;\n\u00b7\nrelease, misuse or appropriation of client intellectual property, or other confidential or other property or proprietary information;\n\u00b7\nmisappropriation of funds;\n\u00b7\ncybersecurity breaches affecting our clients and/or us;\n\u00b7\ndamage to customer facilities due to negligence of temporary workers; and\n\u00b7\ncriminal misconduct or illegal activity by our temporary workers.\nWe may incur fines and other losses or negative publicity with respect to these problems and claims. Such claims may result in negative publicity, injunctive relief, criminal investigations and/or charges, payment by us of monetary damages or fines, or other material adverse effects on our business. In addition, these claims may give rise to litigation, which could be time-consuming and expensive. New employment and labor laws and regulations may be proposed or adopted that may increase the potential exposure of employers to employment-related claims and litigation. There can be no assurance that the corporate policies we have in place to help reduce our exposure to these risks will be effective or that we will not experience losses as a result of these risks. There can also be no assurance that the insurance policies we have purchased to insure against certain risks will be adequate or that insurance coverage will remain available on reasonable terms or be sufficient in amount or scope of coverage.\nWE FACE SIGNIFICANT EMPLOYMENT-RELATED LEGAL RISK.\nWe employ people internally and in the workplaces of other businesses. Many of these individuals have access to client information systems and confidential information. An inherent risk of such activity includes possible claims of errors and omissions; intentional misconduct; release, misuse or misappropriation of client intellectual property, confidential information, funds, or other property; cyber security breaches affecting our clients and/or us; discrimination and harassment claims; employment of illegal aliens; criminal activity; torts; or other claims. Such claims may result in negative publicity, injunctive relief, criminal investigations and/or charges, civil litigation, payment by us of monetary damages or fines, or other material adverse effects on our business.\nOUR ABILITY TO UTILIZE OUR NET OPERATING CARRYFORWARDS AND CERTAIN OTHER TAX ATTRIBUTES MAY BE LIMITED.\nFederal and state tax laws impose restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined by section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cSection 382\u201d). Generally, an ownership change occurs if the percentage of the value of the stock that is owned by one or more direct or indirect \u201cfive percent shareholders\u201d increases by more than 50% over their lowest ownership percentage at any time during the applicable testing period (typically, three years).\nUnder Section 382, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We have not completed a study to assess whether an \u201cownership change\u201d has occurred or whether there have been multiple ownership changes since we became a \u201closs corporation\u201d as defined in Section 382. Future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an \u201cownership change\u201d. In addition, future equity offerings or acquisitions that have equity as a component of the purchase price could result in an \u201cownership change.\u201d If an \u201cownership change\u201d has occurred or does occur in the future, utilization of the NOL carryforwards or other tax attributes may be limited, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.\nTHE MARKET PRICE OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN VOLATILE, WHICH COULD CAUSE THE VALUE OF YOUR INVESTMENT TO DECLINE. A MORE ACTIVE, LIQUID TRADING MARKET FOR OUR COMMON STOCK MAY NOT DEVELOP, AND THE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY.\nThe market price of our common stock has been highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. The securities markets have experienced significant volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Market volatility, as well as general economic, market, or political conditions, could reduce the market price of shares of our common stock regardless of our operating performance.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the NYSE American, we cannot assure you that an active public market will develop for our common stock. There has been relatively limited trading volume in the market for our common stock, and a more active, liquid public trading market may not develop or may not be sustained. Limited liquidity in the trading market for our common stock may adversely affect a shareholder\u2019s ability to sell its shares of common stock at the time it wishes to sell them or at a price that it considers acceptable. If a more active, liquid public trading market does not develop, we may be limited in our ability to raise capital by selling shares of common stock and our ability to acquire other companies or assets by using shares of our common stock as consideration. In addition, if there is a thin trading market or \u201cfloat\u201d for our stock, the market price for our common stock may fluctuate significantly more than the stock market as a whole. Without a large enough float, our common stock would be less liquid than the stock of companies with broader public ownership and, as a result, the trading prices of our common stock may be more volatile. Furthermore, the stock market is subject to significant price and volume fluctuations, and the price of our common stock could fluctuate widely in response to several factors, including:\n\u00b7\nour quarterly or annual operating results and financial position;\n\u00b7\nadverse market reaction to our indebtedness;\n\u00b7\nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our management, employees, partners, customers, and operating results;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments;\n\u00b7\nlitigation and government investigations;\n\u00b7\npending or recently completed acquisitions;\n\u00b7\ninvestment recommendations by securities analysts following our business or our industry;\n\u00b7\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the business, earnings estimates or market perceptions of our competitors;\n\u00b7\nour failure to achieve operating results consistent with securities analysts\u2019 projections;\n\u00b7\nchanges in industry, general market or economic conditions; and\n\u00b7\nchanges or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations or enforcement of laws or regulations affecting our business.\nIn response, the market price of shares of our common stock could decrease significantly. You may be unable to resell your shares of common stock at or above the public offering price.\nFollowing periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOUR COMMON STOCK COULD BE DELISTED FROM THE NYSE AMERICAN IF WE DO NOT MEET ITS CONTINUED LISTING REQUIREMENTS.\nThe NYSE American has established certain standards for the continued listing of a security on the NYSE American. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet these standards in the future to maintain the listing of our common stock on the NYSE American. Factors that could have an impact on our ability to maintain the listing of our common stock on NYSE American include the status of the market for our common stock at the time, our reported results of operations in future periods, and general economic, market and industry conditions.\nIf we are delisted from the NYSE American, our common stock may be eligible for trading on an over-the-counter market. In the event that we are not able to obtain a listing on another stock exchange or quotation service for our common stock, it may be extremely difficult or impossible for shareholders to sell their common stock. Moreover, if we are delisted from the NYSE American, but obtain a substitute listing for our common stock, it will likely be on a market with less liquidity, and therefore experience potentially more price volatility than experienced on the NYSE American. Shareholders may not be able to sell their common stock on any such substitute. market in the quantities, at the times, or at the prices that could potentially be available on a more liquid trading market. As a result of these factors, if our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, the price of our common stock is likely to decline. A delisting of our common stock from the NYSE American could also adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for our operations and/or result in a loss of confidence by investors, or employees.\nWE HAVE NO CURRENT PLANS TO PAY CASH DIVIDENDS ON OUR COMMON STOCK; AS A RESULT, YOU MAY NOT RECEIVE ANY RETURN ON INVESTMENT UNLESS YOU SELL YOUR COMMON STOCK FOR A PRICE GREATER THAN THAT WHICH YOU PAID FOR IT.\nWe intend to retain all future earnings for use in the development of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. Any future determination to pay dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws. It will depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions, general business conditions, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends is restricted by the terms of our debt financing arrangements, and any future debt financing arrangement likely will contain terms restricting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our common stock. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nTHERE MAY BE FUTURE SALES OF OUR SECURITIES OR OTHER DILUTION OF OUR EQUITY, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future to finance our operations, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts or other operations.\nWe have had recurring losses from operations, negative operating cash flow in the past and have an accumulated deficit. We have had to raise additional funds in order to continue financing our operations and may have to in the future. If additional capital is not available to us when needed or on acceptable terms, we may not be able to continue to operate our business pursuant to our business plan or we may have to discontinue our operations entirely. Any additional capital raised through the sale of equity or equity-backed securities may dilute our shareholders\u2019 ownership percentages and could also result in a decrease in the market value of our equity securities. The terms of any securities issued by us in future capital transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect on the holders of any of our securities then outstanding.\nIf we are unable to secure additional funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be required to defer, reduce or eliminate significant planned expenditures, restructure, curtail or eliminate some or all of our operations, dispose of technology or assets, pursue an acquisition of our company by a third party at a price that may result in a loss on investment for our shareholders, file for bankruptcy or cease operations altogether. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, if we are unable to obtain additional funds on a timely basis, there will be substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and increased risk of insolvency and up to a total loss of investment by our shareholders.\nPROVISIONS IN OUR AMENDED AND RESTATED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION, AS AMENDED, OUR AMENDED AND RESTATED BY-LAWS, AS AMENDED AND ILLINOIS LAW MIGHT DISCOURAGE, DELAY OR PREVENT A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF OUR COMPANY OR CHANGES IN OUR MANAGEMENT AND, THEREFORE, DEPRESS THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.\nProvisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, our amended and restated by-laws, as amended, and Illinois law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or changes in our management, including transactions in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the ability of shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders. Special meetings of our shareholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, our president, a majority of the members of the board of directors, or by one or more shareholders holding shares in the aggregate entitled to cast not less than 20% of the votes at the special meeting;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without shareholder approval, which could include the right to approve an acquisition or other change in our control or could be used to institute a rights plan, also known as a poison pill, that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors; and\n\u00b7\nrestrictions pursuant to the Illinois Business Corporation Act (the \u201cIBCA\u201d) that prohibit a publicly held Illinois corporation from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d for a period of three years following the time the person became an interested shareholder, unless the business combination or the acquisition of shares that resulted in a shareholder becoming an interested shareholder is approved in a prescribed manner. Generally, a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested shareholder. Generally, an \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns (or within three years prior to the determination of interested shareholder status did own) 15% or more of a corporation\u2019s voting stock. The existence of this provision would be expected to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors, including discouraging attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for our stock.\nThe existence of the forgoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nIF SECURITIES OR INDUSTRY ANALYSTS DO NOT PUBLISH OR CEASE PUBLISHING RESEARCH OR REPORTS ABOUT US, OUR BUSINESS OR OUR MARKET, OR IF THEY CHANGE THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING OUR STOCK ADVERSELY, OUR STOCK PRICE AND TRADING VOLUME COULD DECLINE.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nA POSSIBLE \u201cSHORT SQUEEZE\u201d DUE TO A SUDDEN INCREASE IN DEMAND OF OUR COMMON STOCK THAT LARGELY EXCEEDS SUPPLY MAY LEAD TO FURTHER PRICE VOLATILITY IN OUR COMMON STOCK.\nInvestors may purchase our common stock to hedge existing exposure in our common stock or to speculate on the price of our common stock. Speculation on the price of our common stock may involve long and short exposures. To the extent aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of shares of our common stock available for purchase in the open market, investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase our common stock for delivery to lenders of our common stock. Those repurchases may in turn, dramatically increase the price of our common stock until investors with short exposure are able to purchase additional common shares to cover their short position. This is often referred to as a \u201cshort squeeze.\u201d A short squeeze could lead to volatile price movements in our common stock that are not directly correlated to the performance or prospects of our company and once investors purchase the shares of common stock necessary to cover their short position the price of our common stock may decline.\nTHE REQUIREMENTS OF BEING A PUBLIC COMPANY MAY STRAIN OUR FINANCIAL AND HUMAN RESOURCES AND DISTRACT MANAGEMENT.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d). These requirements are extensive. The Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting.\nWe incur significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements and costs associated with applicable corporate governance requirements. These applicable rules and regulations significantly increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly than privately owned companies that are not SEC registrants. This also may divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which must be balanced so as not to cause material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also believe compliance risks associated with these rules and regulations tend to make it more difficult and expensive to obtain director and officer liability insurance and could result in our need to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our Board of Directors or as executive officers. We are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these rules, and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.\nAdditionally, shareholder activism, the current political environment, and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly.\nWE MAY BE UNABLE TO IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN APPROPRIATE INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACCURATELY REPORT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CURRENT AND POTENTIAL SHAREHOLDERS MAY LOSE CONFIDENCE IN OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the SEC rules require that our management report annually on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures. Among other things, our management must conduct an assessment of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nA \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAny failure to implement or maintain required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses, or could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. These misstatements could result in a restatement of our consolidated financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, reduce our ability to obtain financing or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our stock price.\nTHERE ARE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN ALL CONTROL SYSTEMS, AND MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY OCCUR AND NOT BE DETECTED.\nThe ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 require us to identify material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, which is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that our internal controls and disclosure controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In addition, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, in our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Further, controls can be circumvented by individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more persons, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving our stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, a control may be inadequate because of changes in conditions, such as growth of the Company or increased transaction volume, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nIn addition, discovery and disclosure of a material weakness, could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. Such an occurrence could discourage certain customers or suppliers from doing business with us, cause downgrades in our future debt ratings leading to higher borrowing costs and affect how our stock trades. This could, in turn, negatively affect our ability to access public debt or equity markets for capital.\nOUR OPERATIONS MAY BE AFFECTED BY DOMESTIC AND GLOBAL ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS.\nCustomers\u2019 demand for our services may fluctuate widely with changes in economic conditions in the markets in which we operate. Those conditions include slower employment growth or reductions in employment, which directly impact our service offerings. As a staffing company, our revenue depends on the number of jobs we fill, which in turn depends on economic growth. During economic slowdowns, many customer companies stop hiring altogether. For example, in prior economic downturns, many employers in our operating regions reduced their overall workforce to reflect the slowing demand for their products and services. We may face lower demand and increased pricing pressures during these periods, which this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nINTERRUPTION OF OUR BUSINESS COULD RESULT FROM INCREASED SECURITY MEASURES IN RESPONSE TO TERRORISM OR CIVIL UNREST.\nThe continued threat of terrorism within the United States and the ongoing military action and heightened security measures in response to such threat has and may cause significant disruption to commerce. The U.S. economy in general is being adversely affected by terrorist activities and the potential activities for terrorist activities or other civil unrest. Any economic downturn could adversely impact our results of operations, impair our ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely affect our ability to grow the business. It is impossible to predict how this may affect our business or the economy in the U.S. and in the world. In the event of further threats or acts of terrorism or civil unrest, our business and operations may be severely and adversely affected.\nOUR BUSINESS MAY BE IMPACTED BY POLITICAL EVENTS, WAR, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, INCLEMENT WEATHER, NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS.\nWar, geopolitical uncertainties, public health issues (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and other business interruptions have caused and could cause damage or disruption to commerce and the economy, and thus could have a material adverse effect on us and our customers. Our business operations are subject to interruption by, among others, inclement weather, natural disasters, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks, civil unrest and other hostile acts, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond our control. Such events could decrease demand for our services.\nOUR COMPLIANCE WITH COMPLICATED REGULATIONS CONCERNING CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PUBLIC DISCLOSURE HAS RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL EXPENSES.\nWe are faced with expensive, complicated and evolving disclosure, governance and compliance laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure. New standards are developing concerning environmental, social and governance matters (\u201cESG\u201d) and other emerging socioeconomic trends and matters. In addition, as a staffing company, we are regulated by the U.S. Department of Labor, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and often by state authorities. New or changing laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing compliance work.\nOur failure to comply with all laws, rules and regulations applicable to U.S. public companies could subject us or our management to regulatory scrutiny or sanction, which could harm our reputation and stock price. Our efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards are likely to continue to result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.", "PERMNO": 46834, "SIC": 7361, "TIC": "JOB"}
