{"cik": "64463", "company": "Soluna Holdings, Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-31", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition and operating results are subject to a number of risk factors, both those that are known to us and identified below and others that may arise from time to time. These risk factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those suggested by forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this \u201cReport\u201d) and elsewhere, and may adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. If any of these risk factors should occur, moreover, the trading price of our securities could decline, and investors in our securities could lose all or part of their investment in our securities. These risk factors, along with other information contained in this Report, should be carefully considered in evaluating our prospects.\nRisks Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic, Inflation, Recent Governmental Sanctions and Global Economic Uncertainty\nAdverse changes in economic or other market conditions in the United States and globally may have serious implications for the growth and stability of our business and could otherwise adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is affected by general economic conditions, both inside and outside of the United States. Adverse changes to and uncertainty in the global economy, particularly in light of (i) the continuing uncertainty regarding the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of the recently-discovered Omicron variant or potential resurgences or the emergence of new variants and (ii) recent inflation in the United States and (iii) foreign and domestic government sanctions imposed on Russia as a result of its recent invasion of Ukraine, may each or collectively cause setbacks in the global economic recovery or trigger future economic slowdowns or recessions, which could lead to decreased demand for our products and for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, revenue fluctuations and increased price competition for our products, and may increase the risk of excess and obsolete inventories and higher overhead costs as a percentage of our revenue. Such events could also result in a decline in business and economic forecasts, which could adversely affect our sales in future periods. Additionally, the financial strength of our customers and suppliers and their ability to obtain and rely on credit financing may affect their ability to fulfill their obligations to us and have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nRevenue growth and continued profitability of our MTI Instruments business will significantly depend on the overall demand for test and measurement instrumentations in key markets including research and development, automotive, semiconductor, cryptocurrencies and electronics. The U.S. and global economies have been historically cyclical and market conditions continue to be challenging, which has resulted in companies delaying or reducing expenditures. We believe there is still lingering volatility and uncertainty in domestic and global financial markets, particularly in light of recent resurgences of COVID-19 variants, domestic inflation and foreign and domestic government sanctions. Further changes or disruptions in the national or global financial markets for any reason may cause consumers, businesses and governments to defer purchases in response to tighter credit, decreased cash availability and declining consumer confidence. Accordingly, demand for our products could decrease and differ materially from their current expectations. Further, some of our customers may require substantial financing in order to fund their operations and make purchases from us. The inability of these customers to obtain sufficient credit to finance purchases of our products and meet their payment obligations to us or possible insolvencies of our customers could result in decreased customer demand, an impaired ability for us to collect on outstanding accounts receivable, significant delays in accounts receivable payments and significant write-offs of accounts receivable, each of which could adversely impact our business and our financial results.\nThe long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, or the impacts of any future pandemics or other health crises, are unknown and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flow.\nOur overall performance generally depends upon domestic and worldwide economic and political conditions. The global spread of COVID-19 has created volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. Early on, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a slowdown, and, going forward, may cause future slowdowns in worldwide economic activity, decreased demand for products and services and financial markets. Meanwhile, the pandemic has been responsible for macro disruptions to global supply chains, including a global semiconductor chip shortage, which economic upheaval may increase if there are surges in transmission and illness from COVID-19 going forward, including as a result of current or new variants.\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic, and the changes to our operations necessitated by governmental and societal actions to contain it, including social distancing and the closing and/or limits on the business operations, required us to make certain changes to the way we conduct our business and operations, we have been fortunate that, to date, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a limited impact on our supply chains, distribution systems and ability to continue to conduct our business and operations. We cannot, however, predict the longer-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, or future health emergencies, on our business, operations, revenues, results of operations, or financial condition. The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any future pandemic or other health crises, will depend on evolving and future developments.\nIn addition, while the global supply-chain disruptions and semiconductor shortage noted above have not had a significant impact on our mining operations to date, if these conditions continue, we may not be able to obtain new cryptocurrency mining equipment (\u201cminers\u201d) to replace miners that are no longer functioning, expand our cryptocurrency mining operations, keep up with technological developments or be able to obtain replacement parts for our existing miners in a timely or cost-effective manner. As the cost to produce these miners increases, these costs are passed on to us. and until the global supply chain crisis is resolved and these extraordinary pressures are alleviated, we may continue to incur higher than usual costs to obtain and deploy new miners, this could negatively impact our ability to expand our mining operations and compete in the cryptocurrency mining industry, and otherwise could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFurther, the long-term social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or the acceleration of pre-existing trends as a result thereof, are still uncertain, and it is not possible at this time to estimate the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, as the impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. It is also unknowable what impacts future pandemics or health emergencies may bring. In either case, any such developments could materially and adversely affect our customer base or the demand for our products, which would have a negative effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition, all of which could have a negative effect on the market price of our securities.\nRisks Related to our SCI Business and Cryptocurrency\nSCI has a limited operating history and we may not recognize operating income from the SCI line of business in the future.\nSCI began operations in January 2020 and therefore is subject to all the risks inherent in a newly established business venture in a rapidly developing and changing industry. SCI\u2019s limited operating history also makes it difficult to evaluate SCI\u2019s current business and its future prospects. SCI has not yet been able to confirm that its business model can or will be successful over the long term, and we may not ever continue to recognize operating income from this business. Our projections for its growth have been developed internally and may not prove to be accurate. SCI\u2019s operating results will likely fluctuate moving forward as we focus on increasing its mining operations and as the market prices of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fluctuate. We may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect SCI\u2019s operating results, such as modifications to its business structure or operations. In addition, we expect additional growth in this business, which could place significant demands on SCI\u2019s and the Company\u2019s management and other resources and require us to continue developing and improving our operational, financial and other internal controls. SCI may not be able to address these challenges in a cost-effective manner or at all. If we do not effectively manage SCI\u2019s growth, it may not be able to execute on its business plan, respond to competitive pressures or take advantage of market opportunities, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed.\nGiven SCI\u2019s start-up status with an unproven business model, there is a substantial risk regarding SCI\u2019s ability to succeed. You should consider our business and prospects in light of these risks and the risks and difficulties that we will encounter as we continue to develop our business model. We may not be able to address these risks and difficulties successfully, which would materially harm our business and operating results, and we could be forced to terminate our business, liquidate our assets and dissolve, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nPrices of cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile, and if our mined cryptocurrencies are converted into dollars when such values are low, we may not recognize the income from the conversion of the mined cryptocurrencies that we were expecting.\nThe fluctuating prices of cryptocurrencies represent significant uncertainties for SCI\u2019s business. The price of Bitcoin, Ether and other cryptocurrencies are subject to dramatic fluctuations. A variety of factors, known and unknown, may affect price and valuation, including, but not limited to (i) the supply of such cryptocurrencies; (ii) global blockchain asset demand, which can be influenced by the growth of retail merchants\u2019 and commercial businesses\u2019 acceptance of blockchain assets like cryptocurrencies as payment for goods and services, the security of online cryptocurrency exchanges and networks and digital wallets that hold blockchain assets, the perception that the use and holding of blockchain assets is safe and secure, and the regulatory restrictions on their use; (iii) investors\u2019 expectations with respect to the rate of inflation; (iv) changes in the software, software requirements or hardware requirements underlying a blockchain network; (v) changes in the rights, obligations, incentives or rewards for the various participants in a blockchain network; (vi) currency exchange rates; (vii) fiat currency withdrawal and deposit policies of cryptocurrency exchanges and networks and liquidity on such exchanges and networks; (viii) interruptions in service from or failures of major cryptocurrency exchanges and networks; (ix) investment and trading activities of large subscribers, including private and registered investment funds, that may directly or indirectly invest in blockchain assets; (x) monetary policies of governments, trade restrictions, currency devaluations and revaluations; (xi) regulatory measures, if any, that affect the use of blockchain assets; (xii) the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the cryptocurrency networks; (xiii) global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations; (xiv) expectations among blockchain participants that the value of blockchain assets will soon change; and (xv) a decrease in the price of blockchain assets that may have a material adverse effect on SCI\u2019s financial condition and operating results. If our mined cryptocurrencies are converted into dollars when their values are low, we may not recognize the income from the conversion of the mined cryptocurrencies that we were expecting. Further, the extreme swings in value can make it difficult for us to develop reasonable financial plans and projections with respect to SCI\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s business model is evolving and is subject to various uncertainties.\nThe likelihood of the Company\u2019s success must be considered in light of our ability to generate revenues by providing relevant services to our partners in an uncertain industry or industries, including the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry in which we currently operate and the data center development industry in which we intend to operate, which, in the Company\u2019s view, creates and will continue to create an uncertain business environment for the Company. As the Company\u2019s business model evolves, it is possible that we will decide to modify our business strategy and commence operations in an entirely different industry than the ones in which the Company currently operates. The Company cannot offer any assurance that these or any other modifications will be successful or will not result in harm to our business. We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. Further, the Company cannot provide any assurance that it will successfully identify all emerging trends and growth opportunities in any particular business sector and the Company may lose out on business opportunities. Additionally, current global and regional economic conditions may have a material effect on the demand for the Company\u2019s services, which could also materially affect the Company\u2019s partners. Deterioration in the global macroeconomic environment or in certain regions could impact the Company\u2019s financial condition and operations and, depending upon the severity and duration of these factors, the Company\u2019s profitability and liquidity position could be negatively impacted. All such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, prospects and/or operations. These risks will be heightened if the Company sells its MTI Instruments business, whether pursuant to the LOI or otherwise.\nSCI may not be able to continue to develop its technology and keep pace with technological developments, expand its mining operations or otherwise compete with other companies, some of whom have greater resources and experience.\nWe do not have the resources to compete with larger cryptocurrency mining entities at this time and may not be able to compete successfully against present or future competitors. The cryptocurrency industry has attracted various high-profile and well-established operators, some of which have substantially greater liquidity and financial resources than we do. With the limited resources we have available, we may experience great difficulties in expanding and improving our network of miners to remain competitive, and we may not be in a position to construct additional operational cryptocurrency mines.\nRapid technological change is a current feature of the cryptocurrency industry, including cryptocurrency mining, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to achieve the technological advances, in a timely manner or at all, that may be necessary for us to remain competitive or that certain of our equipment will not become obsolete. Our ability to anticipate and manage changes in technology standards on a timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive. We may not be successful, generally or relative to our competitors, in timely implementing new technology into our systems, or doing so in a cost-effective manner. During the course of implementing any such new technology into our operations, we may experience system interruptions and failures. Further, if due to technological developments we need to replace our miners entirely to remain competitive in the market, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on a cost-effective basis or in a timely manner, particularly in light of the long production period to manufacture and assemble cryptocurrency miners, potential large-scale purchases of miners from existing competitors and new entrants into the industry, and the current semiconductor chip shortage. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will recognize, in a timely manner or at all, the benefits that we may expect as a result of our implementing new technology into our operations. As a result, our business, prospects, and operations may suffer, and there may be adverse effects on our financial condition and on the market prices of our securities.\nIn addition, competition from existing and future competitors, particularly the many other North American companies that have access to more competitively-priced energy, could result in our inability to secure acquisitions and partnerships that we may need to expand our business in the future. This competition from other entities with greater resources, experience and reputations may result in our failure to maintain or expand our business, as we may never be able to successfully execute our business plan. If we are unable to expand and remain competitive, our business could be negatively affected which would have an adverse effect on the trading prices of our securities, which in turn would harm investors in our Company.\nThere are several new and existing competitors in our industry that are purchasing mining equipment at scale, which may cause delays or difficulty in us obtaining new miners, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nMany of the competitors in our industry have also been purchasing mining equipment at scale, which has caused a worldwide shortage of mining equipment and extended the corresponding delivery schedules for new miner purchases. There can be no assurance that manufacturers will be able to keep pace with the surge in demand for mining equipment. It is uncertain how manufacturers will respond to this increased global demand. In the event manufacturers are not able to keep pace with demand, we may not be able to purchase miners in sufficient quantities or on the delivery schedules that meet our business needs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, prospects, operating income and financial condition, which would likely result in a decrease in the market value of our Common Stock.\nWe may be unable to obtain additional funding to scale the SCI cryptocurrency business to a larger-scale cryptocurrency mining operation.\nWe are considering further increasing the processing power of our cryptocurrency mining operations as we seek to leverage our experience and expertise in this area of operations. To do so, however, we will need to raise additional debt and/or equity financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Failure to generate adequate cash from our operations or find sources of funding would require us to scale back or curtail our operations or expansion efforts, including limiting our ability to expand the SCI cryptocurrency business to a larger-scale cryptocurrency mining operation, and would have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition. If we raise additional equity financing, our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests, and the per-share value of our Common Stock could decline. Furthermore, if we engage in additional debt financing, the holders of debt likely would have priority over the holders of Common Stock on order of payment preference. We may be required to accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or take other actions including terms that require us to maintain specified liquidity or other ratios that could otherwise not be in the interests of our stockholders.\nRegulatory changes or actions may alter the nature of an investment in us or restrict the use of cryptocurrencies in a manner that adversely affects our business, prospects or operations and profitability.\nAs cryptocurrencies have grown in both popularity and market size, governments around the world have reacted, and continue to react, differently to cryptocurrencies; certain governments have deemed them illegal, and others have allowed their use and trade without restriction, while in some jurisdictions, such as in the U.S., cryptocurrencies are subject to extensive, and in some cases overlapping, unclear, and evolving, regulatory requirements. In the United States, Congress and various federal agencies have increased their focus on the cryptocurrency sector during the past year. Moreover, the use of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, as a potential means of avoiding federally-imposed sanctions, such as those imposed in connection with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, may lead to new regulatory requirements. For example, on March 2, 2022, a group of United States Senators sent the Secretary of the United States Treasury Department a letter asking Secretary Yellen to investigate its ability to enforce such sanctions vis-\u00e0-vis Bitcoin, and on March 8, 2022, President Biden announced an executive order on cryptocurrencies which seeks to establish a unified federal regulatory regime for cryptocurrencies. We are unable to predict the nature or extent of new and proposed legislation and regulation affecting the cryptocurrency industry. Increasing regulation and regulatory scrutiny may result in increased costs, management having to devote increased time and attention to regulatory matters, having to change aspects of our cryptocurrency mining business, or result in limits on the use cases of cryptocurrencies, which could decrease their value. Regulatory developments may require us to comply with new regulatory requirements, which would increase our operating costs. In addition, ongoing and future regulatory actions could significantly restrict or eliminate the market for or uses of cryptocurrencies and otherwise materially and adversely impact our ability to continue to operate and to continue as a going concern, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operations and financial condition, as well as on the value and trading prices of our securities.\nSecurity breaches could result in a loss of our cryptocurrencies.\nSecurity breaches including computer hacking or computer malware have been a consistent concern in the cryptocurrency industry. This could involve hacking in which an unauthorized person obtains access to the systems or information and can cause harm by the transmission of virus or the corruption of data. These breaches may occur due to an action by an outside party or by the error and negligence of an employee. We primarily rely on the Luxor mining pool and SCI\u2019s cryptocurrencies are stored with exchanges such as Coinbase prior to selling them. If any breach were to occur of our security system, operations or third party platforms, the result could cause a loss of our cryptocurrencies, loss of confidential or proprietary information, force the Company to cease operations or could cause damage to the reputation of the Company. If an actual or perceived attack were to occur, the market perception of the Company may be damaged, which could adversely affect potential and current investments in the Company and reduce demand for our securities and cause a reduction in our share prices.\nIncorrect or fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions may be irreversible.\nIt is possible that, through computer or human error, theft or criminal action, our cryptocurrency could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties or accounts. In general, cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible, and stolen or incorrectly transferred cryptocurrencies may be irretrievable, and we may have extremely limited or no effective means of recovering any losses as a result of an incorrect transfer or theft. As a result, any incorrectly executed or fraudulent cryptocurrency transactions could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe impact of geopolitical and economic events on the supply and demand for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is uncertain.\nGeopolitical crises may motivate large-scale purchases of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which could rapidly increase the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. This may increase the likelihood of a subsequent price decrease as crisis-driven purchasing behavior dissipates, adversely affecting the value of the cryptocurrencies that we mine. Alternatively, as an emerging asset class with limited acceptance as a payment system or commodity, global crises and general economic downturn may discourage investment in cryptocurrencies as investors focus their investment on less volatile asset classes as a means of hedging their investment risk.\nCryptocurrencies, which are relatively new, are subject to supply and demand forces. How such supply and demand will be impacted by geopolitical events is largely uncertain but could be harmful to us and investors in our securities. Political or economic crises may motivate large-scale acquisitions or sales of cryptocurrencies either globally or locally. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our strategy at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies that we mine.\nThe failure of cryptocurrencies to become widely accepted and/or used as a medium of exchange and method of payment could adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition.\nThe use of cryptocurrencies in the retail and commercial marketplace, despite sporadic adoption, is currently limited. A significant portion of cryptocurrency demand is generated by investors seeking a long-term store of value or speculators seeking to profit from the short- or long-term holding of the asset. Price volatility, slow processing speeds and high transaction costs undermine Bitcoin\u2019s and other cryptocurrencies\u2019 ability to be used as a medium of exchange, as retailers are less likely to accept it as a direct form of payment. Large-scale acceptance of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment has not, and may never, occur.\nThe relative lack of acceptance of cryptocurrencies in the retail and commercial marketplace, or a reduction of such use, limits the ability of end users to use them to pay for goods and services. Such lack of acceptance or a decline in acceptance could have a material adverse effect on the value of the cryptocurrencies that we mine, the viability of cryptocurrency mining as a business, and our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operations and financial condition, as well as on the market value of our securities.\nBitcoin and Bitcoin mining, as well as cryptocurrencies generally, may be made illegal in certain jurisdictions, including the ones we operate in, which could adversely affect our business prospects and operations.\nAlthough we do not anticipate any material adverse regulations on Bitcoin mining in our jurisdictions of operation, it is possible that state or federal regulators may seek to impose harsh restrictions or total bans on cryptocurrency mining which may make it impossible for us to do business without relocating our mining operations, which could be very costly and time consuming. Further, although Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining, as well as cryptocurrencies generally, are largely unregulated in most countries (including the United States), regulators in certain jurisdictions may undertake new or intensify existing regulatory actions in the future that could severely restrict the right to mine, acquire, own, hold, sell, or use cryptocurrency or to exchange it for traditional fiat currency such as the United States Dollar. Such restrictions may adversely affect us as the large-scale use of cryptocurrencies as a means of exchange is presently confined to certain regions globally. Such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations and potentially the value of any Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies we mine, and thus harm our investors.\nOur interactions with a blockchain may expose us to specially designated nationals (\u201cSDN\u201d) or blocked persons and new legislation or regulation could adversely impact our business or the market for cryptocurrencies.\nThe Office of Financial Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) of the U.S. Department of Treasury requires us to comply with its sanction program and not conduct business with persons named on its SDN list. However, because of the pseudonymous nature of blockchain transactions we may inadvertently and without our knowledge engage in transactions with persons named on OFAC\u2019s SDN list. Our Company\u2019s policy prohibits any transactions with such SDN individuals, but we may not be adequately capable of determining the ultimate identity of the individual with whom we transact with respect to selling cryptocurrency assets. We are unable to predict the nature or extent of new and proposed legislation and regulation affecting the cryptocurrency industry, or the potential impact of the use of cryptocurrencies by SDN or other blocked or sanctioned persons, which could have material adverse effects on our business and our industry more broadly. Further, we may be subject to investigation, administrative or court proceedings, and civil or criminal monetary fines and penalties as a result of any regulatory enforcement actions, all of which could harm our reputation and affect the value of our securities.\nProposed development of a cryptocurrency, as well as the eventual likely development of government-backed digital currencies and the development of cryptocurrencies by other tech companies, may adversely affect the value of Bitcoin and other existing, or even future, cryptocurrencies.\nIn May 2019, Facebook, now named Meta, announced its plans for a cryptocurrency then called Libra and later called Diem, which faced significant objections and concerns from governments, legislators and regulators. Following such objections and concerns, Diem\u2019s development was abandoned and its assets (including both the technology and intellectual property) sold to Silvergate Capital Corp., the holding company for Silvergate Bank, based in La Jolla, California, on January 31, 2022. Silvergate Capital Corp. reportedly is hoping to issue a new digital currency using these recently purchased assets by the end of this year. If Silvergate Capital is successful in this regard, it may further encourage other financial institutions or even other technology companies and other entities to develop their own cryptocurrencies, which could negatively impact the value of existing cyptocurrencies. Further, in the event that government-backed digital currencies, which regulators in several countries are already considering or even developing, are developed and widely adopted, it is likely to have a negative impact on the existing currencies including larger widespread adoption and potentially impacting the market share by non-government digital currency. Additional cryptocurrencies are introduced to the market frequently, and although some have gained popularity as some features have been different than Bitcoin, Bitcoin remains the market leader. As cryptocurrency adoption grows, the likelihood increases that additional cryptocurrencies will be introduced and gain popularity against Bitcoin, potentially negatively impacting the value of Bitcoin and perhaps other cryptocurrencies.\nBecause our most of our miners are designed specifically to mine Bitcoin and may not be readily adaptable to mining other cryptocurrencies, a sustained decline in Bitcoin\u2019s value could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe have invested substantial capital in acquiring miners designed specifically to mine Bitcoin as efficiently and as rapidly as possible on our assumption that we will be able to use them to mine Bitcoin and generate revenue from our operations. Therefore, our mining operations focus primarily on mining Bitcoin, and our mining revenue is largely based on the value of Bitcoin we mine. Accordingly, if the value of Bitcoin declines and fails to recover, for example, because of the development and acceptance of competing blockchain platforms or technologies, including competing cryptocurrencies which our miners may not be able to mine, the revenue we generate from our mining operations will likewise decline. Moreover, we may not be able to successfully repurpose our mining operations in a timely manner, if at all, if we decide to switch to mining a different cryptocurrency (or to another purpose altogether) following a sustained decline in Bitcoin\u2019s value or if Bitcoin is replaced by another cryptocurrency. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operations and financial condition, as well as on the market value of our securities.\nThe properties included in our mining network may experience damages, including damages that are not covered by insurance.\nOur current mining operation in East Wenatchee, Washington, Murray, Kentucky, and Calvert City, Kentucky are, and any future mines we establish will be, subject to a variety of risks relating to physical condition and operation, including:\n\u25cf the presence of construction or repair defects or other structural or building damage;\n\u25cf any noncompliance with or liabilities under applicable environmental, health or safety regulations or requirements or building permit requirements; and\n\u25cf any damage resulting from natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, fires, floods and windstorms.\nFor example, our mine could be rendered inoperable, temporarily or permanently, as a result of a fire or other natural disaster or by a terrorist or other attack on the mine. The security and other measures we take to protect against these risks may not be sufficient. Additionally, our mines could be materially adversely affected by a power outage, loss of access to the electrical grid, or loss by the grid of cost-effective sources of electrical power generating capacity. Given the power requirement, it would not be feasible to run miners on back-up power generators in the event of a power outage. Our insurance covers the replacement cost of any lost or damaged miners, but does not cover any interruption of our mining activities; our insurance therefore may not be adequate to cover the losses we suffer as a result of any of these events. In the event of an uninsured loss, including a loss in excess of insured limits, at any of the mines in our network, such mines may not be adequately repaired in a timely manner or at all and we may lose some or all of the future revenues anticipated to be derived from such mines. The potential impact on our business is currently magnified because we are only operating a single mine.\nSCI\u2019s reliance on a third-party mining pool service provider for our mining revenue payouts may have a negative impact on SCI\u2019s operations.\nWe use a third-party mining pool to receive our mining rewards from the network. Cryptocurrency mining pools allow miners to combine their computing power, increasing their chances of solving a block and getting paid by the network. The rewards are distributed by the pool operator, proportionally to our contribution to the pool\u2019s overall mining power, used to generate each block. Should the pool operator\u2019s system suffer downtime due to a cyber-attack, software malfunction, or similar issues, it will negatively impact our ability to mine and receive revenue. Furthermore, we are dependent on the accuracy of the mining pool operator\u2019s recordkeeping to accurately record the total processing power provided to the pool for a given Bitcoin mining application in order to assess the proportion of that total processing power we provided. While we have internal methods of tracking both our power provided and the total used by the pool, the mining pool operator uses its own recordkeeping to determine our proportion of a given reward. We have little means of recourse against the mining pool operator if we determine that the proportion of the reward that the mining pool operator pays out to us is incorrect, other than leaving the pool. If we are unable to consistently obtain accurate proportionate rewards from our mining pool operator, we may experience reduced reward for our efforts, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOver time, incentives for Bitcoin miners to continue to contribute processing power to the Bitcoin network may transition from a set reward to transaction fees. If the incentives for Bitcoin mining are not sufficiently high, we may not have an adequate incentive to continue to mine.\nIn general, as the number of Bitcoin rewards awarded for solving a block in a blockchain decreases, our ability to achieve profitability also decreases. Decreased use and demand for Bitcoin rewards may adversely affect our incentive to expend processing power to solve blocks. If the Bitcoin rewards for solving blocks and transaction fees are not sufficiently high, fewer Bitcoin miners will mine. At insufficiently attractive rewards, our costs of operations in total may exceed our revenues from Bitcoin mining.\nTo incentivize Bitcoin miners to continue to contribute processing power to the Bitcoin network, such network may either formally or informally transition from a set reward to transaction fees earned upon solving a block. This transition could be accomplished either by Bitcoin miners independently electing to record in the blocks they solve only those transactions that include payment of a transaction fee or by the Bitcoin network adopting software upgrades that require the payment of a minimum transaction fee for all transactions. If as a result transaction fees paid for Bitcoin transactions become too high, Bitcoin users may be reluctant to transfer Bitcoin or accept Bitcoin as a means of payment, and existing users may be motivated to hold existing Bitcoin and switch from Bitcoin to another digital asset or back to fiat currency for transactions, diminishing the aggregate amount of available transaction fees for Bitcoin miners. Such reduction would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Bitcoin reward for successfully uncovering a block will halve several times in the future, and Bitcoin\u2019s value may not adjust to compensate us for the reduction in the rewards we receive from our Bitcoin mining efforts.\nHalving is a process designed to control the overall supply and reduce the risk of inflation in cryptocurrencies using a proof of work consensus algorithm. At a predetermined block, the Bitcoin mining reward is cut in half, hence the term \u201chalving.\u201d For Bitcoin, the reward was initially set at 50 Bitcoin currency rewards per block and this was cut in half to 25 on November 28, 2012 at block 210,000, then again to 12.5 on July 9, 2016 at block 420,000. The most recent halving for Bitcoin occurred on May 11, 2020 at block 630,000 and the reward was reduced to 6.25. It is expected that the next halving will likely occur in 2024. This process will reoccur until the total amount of Bitcoin currency rewards issued reaches 21 million, which is expected around the year 2140. While Bitcoin prices have had a history of fluctuations around the halving of its rewards, there is no guarantee that the price change will be favorable or would compensate for the reduction in mining reward. If a corresponding and proportionate increase in the trading prices of Bitcoin or a proportionate decrease in mining difficulty does not follow these anticipated halving events, the revenue we earn from our Bitcoin mining operations could see a corresponding decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe may not be able to realize the benefits of forks, and forks in a digital asset network may occur in the future, which may affect the value of the cryptocurrencies that we mine held by us.\nTo the extent that a significant majority of users and miners on a cryptocurrency network install software that changes the cryptocurrency network or properties of a cryptocurrency, including the irreversibility of transactions and limitations on the mining of new cryptocurrency, the cryptocurrency network would be subject to new protocols and software. If less than a significant majority of users and miners on the cryptocurrency network consent to the proposed modification, however, and the modification is not compatible with the software prior to its modification, a \u201cfork\u201d of the network would occur, with one prong of the network running the pre-modified software and the other running the modified software. The effect of such a fork would be the existence of two versions of the cryptocurrency running in parallel, yet lacking interchangeability and necessitating exchange-type transaction to convert currencies between the two forks. After a fork, it may be unclear which fork represents the original asset and which is the new asset.\nIf we hold a specific cryptocurrency at the time of a hard fork into two cryptocurrencies, industry standards would dictate that we would be expected to hold an equivalent amount of the old and new assets following the fork. We may not, however, be able to secure or realize the economic benefit of the new asset. Our business may be adversely impacted by forks in an applicable cryptocurrency network.\nIn addition, historically, speculation over a new \u201chard fork\u201d in the Bitcoin protocol has resulted in Bitcoin price volatility and future hard forks may occur at any time. A hard fork can lead to a disruption of networks and our information technology systems could be affected by cybersecurity attacks, replay attacks or security weaknesses, any of which can further lead to temporary or even permanent loss of its assets. Such disruption and loss could cause us to be exposed to liability, even in circumstances where we have no intention of supporting an asset compromised by a hard fork. Additionally, a hard fork may result in a scenario where users running the previous protocol will not recognize blocks created by those running the new protocol, and vice versa. This may render our cryptocurrency mining hardware incompatible with the new protocol. Such changes may have a material effect on our operations, financial position and financial performance.\nAs the aggregate amount of computing power, or hash rate, in the Bitcoin network increases, the amount of Bitcoin earned per unit of hash rate decreases; as a result, in order to maintain our market share, we may have to incur significant capital expenditures in order to expand our fleet of miners.\nThe aggregate computing power of the global Bitcoin network has generally grown over time and we expect it to continue to grow in the future. To the extent the global hash rate continues to increase, the market share of and the amount of Bitcoin rewards paid to any fixed fleet of miners will decrease. Therefore, in order to maintain our market share, we may be required to expand our mining fleet, which may require significant capital expenditures. If we can\u2019t acquire sufficient numbers of new miners or access sufficient capital to fund our expenditures, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely materially affected. In addition, such significant capital expenditures could have an adverse effect on our business operations, strategy and financial performance.\nClimate change, and the regulatory and legislative developments related to climate change, may materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and would be particular to the geographic circumstances in areas in which we operate or in which our third-party providers operate. These may include changes in rainfall and storm patterns and intensities, water shortages, changing sea levels and changing temperatures. The impacts of climate change may materially and adversely impact the cost, production and financial performance of our operations. Further, any impacts to our business and financial condition as a result of climate change are likely to occur over a sustained period of time and are therefore difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity. For example, extreme weather events may result in adverse physical effects on portions of our infrastructure, which could disrupt our supply chain and ultimately our business operations.\nIn addition, a number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes in response to the potential impact of climate change. Companies across many industries are facing increasing scrutiny related to their environmental, social, and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) practices. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds and other influential investors are also increasingly focused on ESG practices and in recent years have placed increasing importance on the non-financial impacts of their investments. Given the very significant amount of electrical power required to operate cryptocurrency miners, as well as the environmental impact of mining for the rare earth metals used in the production of mining servers, the cryptocurrency mining industry may become a target for future environmental and energy regulation, and any such regulation may not distinguish between cryptocurrency mining powered by renewable energy, as is SCI\u2019s business, and cryptocurrency mining using traditional (i.e. fossil fuel) sources of energy. Legislation and increased regulation regarding climate change could impose significant costs on us and our suppliers, including costs related to increased energy requirements, capital equipment, environmental monitoring and reporting, and other costs to comply with such regulations. Any future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Furthermore, increased public awareness and concern regarding environmental risks, including global climate change, may result in increased public scrutiny of our business and our industry, and our management team may divert significant time and energy away from our operations and towards responding to such scrutiny and reassuring our employees. Given the political significance and uncertainty around the impact of climate change and how it should be addressed, we cannot predict how legislation and regulation will affect our financial condition, operating performance and ability to compete. Any of the foregoing could result in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and financial condition.\nOur business plan is heavily dependent upon acquisitions and strategic alliances and our ability to identify, acquire or ally on appropriate terms, and successfully integrate and manage any acquired companies or alliances will impact our financial condition and operating results.\nPart of our strategy to grow our business is dependent on the acquisition of other entities or businesses in the future that complement our current products, enhance our market coverage or technical capabilities or offer growth opportunities. We may also need to form strategic alliances or partnerships in order to remain competitive in our market. We may not be able, however, to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions alliances, obtain any financing necessary for such acquisitions on satisfactory terms or otherwise complete any such acquisitions or alliances. Further, any acquisition or alliance may require a significant amount of management\u2019s time and financial resources to complete and acquisitions, strategic alliances or partnerships could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business and dilute stockholder value.\nFor example, in January 2020, the Company formed SCI as its wholly owned subsidiary to pursue a new business line focused on cryptocurrency and the blockchain ecosystem. In October 2021, Soluna Computing became a wholly owned subsidiary of SCI pursuant to a merger. Prior to the merger, Soluna Computing had assisted us in developing and operating the cryptocurrency mining facility through contractual arrangements. In the future, we may acquire or form strategic alliances or partnerships with other businesses in order to remain competitive or to acquire new technologies. Acquisitions, alliances and investments involve numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf the potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination, acquisition or alliance;\n\u25cf difficulties in and the cost of integrating operations, technologies, services and personnel;\n\u25cf difficulty of assimilating geographically-dispersed operations and personnel of the companies we acquire or ally with;\n\u25cf impairment of relationships with employees, customers, vendors, distributors or business partners of either an acquired business or our own;\n\u25cf unanticipated difficulties in conforming business practices, policies, procedures, internal controls and financial records of acquisitions with our own;\n\u25cf the potential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize cost savings or other anticipated benefits from integration;\n\u25cf diversion of financial and managerial resources from existing operations;\n\u25cf risk of entering new markets in which we have little or no experience or where competitors may have stronger market positions;\n\u25cf potential write-offs of acquired assets or investments and potential financial and credit risks associated with acquired customers;\n\u25cf inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs;\n\u25cf the risk of cancellation or early termination of an alliance by either party;\n\u25cf potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired businesses;\n\u25cf unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into the existing businesses;\n\u25cf negative impact to our results of operations because of the depreciation and amortization of amounts related to acquired intangible assets, fixed assets and deferred compensation, and the loss of acquired deferred revenue and unbilled deferred revenue;\n\u25cf loss of key employees or customers of acquired companies;\n\u25cf potential disruption of our business or the acquired business;\n\u25cf inability to accurately forecast the performance of recently acquired businesses, resulting in unforeseen adverse effects on our operating results;\n\u25cf the tax effects of any acquisitions; and\n\u25cf Adverse accounting impact to our results of operations.\nOur failure to successfully manage our recent acquisition of Soluna Computing or other future acquisitions, strategic alliances or partnerships could seriously harm our operating results. In addition, our stockholders would be diluted if we finance the future acquisitions, strategic alliances or partnerships by incurring convertible debt or issuing equity securities.\nWe cannot offer any assurance that we will be able to identify, complete or successfully integrate any suitable acquisitions or suitable alliances. Even if successfully negotiated and closed, any acquisitions or alliances may not yield expected synergies, may not advance our business strategy as expected, may fall short of expected return-on-investment targets, or may otherwise fail to achieve their objectives or perform as contemplated and not prove successful. Companies that we acquire may operate with different cost and margin structures, which could further cause fluctuations in our operating results and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn connection with the ground leases for our new cryptocurrency mining operations, we rely on the landlord to sell us the power required for our operations, and any failure of the landlord to supply such power, whether as a result of its failure to pay the TVA or otherwise, would materially impact our operations.\nIn May 2021, Soluna MC, formerly EcoChain Block LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of SCI, entered into two ground leases (the \u201cGround Leases\u201d) for a building located in the Southeast region of the United States that will be SCI\u2019s second cryptocurrency mining facility, which includes surrounding land for potential additional capacity. The Ground Leases will not be effective until certain conditions set forth therein are met. In addition, Soluna MC and the landlord for such building (the \u201cLandlord\u201d) entered into a power supply agreement (the \u201cPower Supply Agreement\u201d), whereby Soluna MC will purchase the power for its cryptocurrency mining operations from the Landlord, who purchases power directly from the TVA. The rates payable by Soluna MC to the Landlord will be at the same pre-negotiated rates paid by the Landlord, which are less than SCI could obtain directly from the TVA. The Landlord\u2019s failure to provide power to SCI, as a result of the termination of such power supply to the Landlord by the TVA, as a result of the Landlord\u2019s failure to pay the TVA for such power, or otherwise, would, in all likelihood, result in our inability to obtain the power we need for our cryptocurrency mining operations, unless and until we were able to obtain such power directly from the TVA, which would result in a significant interruption to our business. We may also incur significant costs associated with negotiating and entering into a new agreement with the TVA to supply power to Soluna MC\u2019s cryptocurrency mining facilities, and with setting up corresponding infrastructure to receive such power directly. Further, there can be no assurance that Soluna MC will be able to negotiate a power supply agreement with the TVA on equally favorable terms as the Landlord, if at all.\nThe properties on which certain of our ground leases are located are subject to possible forfeiture to the U.S. government, and, if seized, would in all likelihood require us to spend significant funds to maintain our cryptocurrency mining rights.\nIn August 2020, the United States Department of Justice\u2019s Money Laundering & Asset Recovery Section (\u201cDOJ\u201d), together with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Florida, filed civil asset forfeiture complaints against parties related to the Landlord (the \u201cLandlord Owners\u201d) in connection with certain real properties, including the real properties that are the subject of the Ground Leases (the \u201cSubject Properties\u201d). The complaints, all of which are currently pending before a federal judge, alleged that the funds used by Landlord Owners to purchase the Subject Properties were traceable to the proceeds of a bank fraud purportedly committed internationally in Ukraine by the Landlord Owners. Though the DOJ has not filed a civil forfeiture action against the Subject Properties, the complaint the government submitted in support of its asset forfeiture requests against certain properties, including the Subject Properties, included a description of the Ukrainian bank fraud and the various properties located in the United States that the DOJ believes were purchased with the proceeds of that international bank fraud, including the Subject Properties. In the event that the Subject Properties are seized by the U.S. government, Soluna MC may be required to negotiate with the U.S. government for the supply of power that SCI was receiving from the Landlord pursuant to the Power Supply Agreement. Additionally, the U.S. government, in all likelihood, would place the Subject Properties for sale at an auction, or otherwise, and we would likely be required to purchase the Subject Properties to assure the continuation of our cryptocurrency mining operations at such facility, all of which would require our expenditure of significant funds and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe may be affected by price fluctuations in the wholesale and retail power markets.\nWhile the majority of our power and hosting arrangements contain fixed power prices, some also contain certain price adjustment mechanisms in case of certain events. Furthermore, a portion of our power and hosting arrangements includes merchant power prices, or power prices reflecting market movements. Market prices for power, generation capacity and ancillary services, are unpredictable. Over the past year, the market prices for power have generally been increasing, driven in part by the price increases in various commodities, including natural gas. Depending upon the effectiveness of any price risk management activity undertaken by us, an increase in market prices for power, generation capacity, and ancillary services may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results. Long- and short-term power prices may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf increases and decreases in generation capacity;\n\u25cf changes in power transmission or fuel transportation capacity constraints or inefficiencies;\n\u25cf volatile weather conditions, particularly unusually hot or mild summers or unusually cold or warm winters;\n\u25cf technological shifts resulting in changes in the demand for power or in patterns of power usage, including the potential development of demand-side management tools, expansion and technological advancements in power storage capability and the development of new fuels or new technologies for the production or storage of power;\n\u25cf federal and state power, market and environmental regulation and legislation; and\n\u25cf changes in capacity prices and capacity markets.\nIf we are unable to secure power supply at prices or on terms acceptable to us, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.\nIf federal or state legislatures or agencies initiate or release tax determinations that change the classification of cryptocurrencies as property for tax purposes (in the context of when such cryptocurrencies are held as an investment), such determination could have a negative tax consequence on us.\nCurrent Internal Revenue Service guidance indicates that digital assets such as Bitcoin should be treated and taxed as property, and that transactions involving the payment of bitcoin for goods and services should be treated as barter transactions. While this treatment creates a potential tax reporting requirement for any circumstance where the ownership of a cryptocurrency passes from one person to another, it preserves the right to apply capital gains treatment to those transactions which may adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Potential Sale of MTI Instruments\nWe have entered into a letter of intent with respect to the sale of our MTI Instruments business and there is no assurance that such sale will be completed on the terms contained in such letter of intent or otherwise.\nOn December 17, 2021, we announced that we entered into the LOI with the Buyer with respect to the Sale. As a result of the pending Sale, we have determined that as of December 31, 2021, the assets and results of operations of the MTI Instruments business meet the qualifications for held for sale and is reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 and prior periods included in this Annual Report. The amount and structure of the consideration could change as a result of subsequent negotiations, due diligence or other factors. Any definitive agreement with respect to the Sale would be subject to approval by the respective parties to the LOI, including approval by our board of directors, and would likely include a number of customary provisions, including without limitation, representations and warranties of MTI Instruments and us, restrictive covenants and indemnification provisions. The LOI is non-binding other than with respect to certain due diligence, solicitation, expenses, non-disclosure and assignment provisions, and the term of the LOI may be extended under certain circumstances. There can be no assurance that the LOI parties will ultimately negotiate and enter into a definitive transaction agreements on the terms contemplated by the LOI or otherwise. In particular, the timing of closing of any such transaction and the aggregate consideration that we may receive may materially differ from that currently contemplated by the LOI. In addition, in the event that the Sale does not occur, we may, in the future, enter into other non-binding or binding letters of intent, as well as definitive documentation relating to the sale of MTI Instruments, however there can be no assurance that we will do so and that any sale of MTI Instruments or our instruments business will occur. If we do not complete the disposition of MTI Instruments pursuant to the LOI, other letters of intent, and any related transaction documentation, we will have incurred expenses without our stockholders realizing any benefit therefrom. Additionally, if we fail to consummate such anticipated Sale, such failure could result in fluctuations to the market prices of our securities, and may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the event that we consummate the Sale pursuant to the LOI and definitive documentation, we will no longer be involved in the instruments business in which MTI Instruments operates and will be solely reliant on SCI\u2019s business, which is currently focused on cryptocurrency mining and which we expect in the future will be focused on green data center development.\nIn the event that the LOI parties enter into definitive agreements regarding the Sale and then consummate the Sale, the Company will be solely reliant on the business of SCI, which is currently focused on cryptocurrency mining. The Company also expects that we will soon be focused on green data center development and to continue to concentrate our resources on such businesses upon the Sale, including potential acquisitions in the future to support such businesses. SCI has a limited operating history and operates in a volatile industry that currently is and may in the future be dependent on and affected by the cryptocurrency market. Accordingly, any adverse effects experienced by SCI and its line of business will have a greater impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and the value of our securities than such effects may have had prior to the Sale. For further information regarding the risks of this business, please see \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Related to our SCI Business and Cryptocurrency.\u201d\nRisks Relating to our MTI Instruments Business\nPlease note that the risks discussed under this subsection will only be applicable to us (i) insofar as we continue to operate our MTI Instruments business, which is currently held for sale and which business has been classified as discontinued operations, (ii) until the anticipated Sale of MTI Instruments or (iii) if we determine not to, or are unable to, sell MTI Instruments as currently intended.\nOur MTI Instruments business depends on a small number of customers including the U.S. Air Force.\nHistorically, we have had a small number of customers representing a large percentage of our total revenue. Although we endeavor to maintain and further expand our customer base, we expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our revenues in any given period for the foreseeable future, and the loss of even just a couple of customers, or a significant reduction in sales to our existing customer base, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our revenues are largely dependent upon the ability of our customers to continue to grow or need services or to develop and sell products that incorporate our services and products. We also depend on purchases by the U.S. Air Force for a significant portion of our revenues and the loss of the U.S. Air Force as a customer or a delay or decline in funding of our existing or future contracts with them could decrease our backlog or adversely affect our business and prospects, sales, cash flows and our ability to fund our continued product development and growth.\nWe do not have long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and our customers are also able to cancel, reduce or delay orders for our products.\nWe generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and frequently do not have visibility as to their future demand for our products and services. Customers also cancel, change or delay design, production or aftermarket service quantities and schedules, or fail to meet their forecasts for a number of reasons beyond our control. Customer expectations can also change rapidly, requiring us to take on additional commitments or risks, and requiring that we provide rapid product turnaround and respond to short lead times. A variety of conditions, both specific to individual customers and generally affecting the demand for original equipment manufacturers\u2019 products, may cause customers to cancel, reduce or delay orders. Conversely, if our customers unexpectedly and significantly increase product orders, we may be required to rapidly increase production, which could strain our resources and reduce our margins. We typically plan production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand, which can be highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially, leading to excess inventory write-downs and resulting negative impacts on gross margin and net income. Additionally, and as a result, our revenues may be volatile from period to period, we may not achieve the anticipated revenues from these efforts, or these efforts may result in non-recoverable costs.\nOur annual and quarterly operating results may experience significant fluctuations, which could adversely impact our operations and financial results.\nIn addition to the variability resulting from the short-term nature of our customers\u2019 commitments, other factors contribute to significant periodic fluctuations in our results of operations. These factors include:\n\u25cf the cyclicality of the markets we serve;\n\u25cf the timing and size of orders;\n\u25cf the volume of orders relative to our capacity;\n\u25cf product introductions and market acceptance of new products or new generations of products;\n\u25cf evolution in the life cycles of our customers\u2019 products;\n\u25cf timing of expenses in anticipation of future orders;\n\u25cf changes in product mix;\n\u25cf availability of manufacturing and assembly services;\n\u25cf changes in cost and availability of labor and components;\n\u25cf timely delivery of product solutions to customers;\n\u25cf pricing and availability of competitive products;\n\u25cf introduction of new technologies into the markets we serve;\n\u25cf pressures on reducing selling prices;\n\u25cf our success in serving new markets; and\n\u25cf changes in economic conditions.\nThe price of our securities could decline substantially in the event that any of these risks result in our financial performance being below the expectations of analysts and investors, which are based on historical and predictive models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological innovations or develop new product solutions in a timely manner.\nThe electronic, semiconductor, solar, automotive and general industrial segments are subject to constant technological change. MTI Instruments\u2019 future success will depend on our ability to respond appropriately to changing technologies and changes in product function and quality. If we rely on products and technologies that are not attractive to end users, we may not be successful in capturing or retaining market share. Technological advances, the introduction of new products and new design techniques could adversely affect our business prospects unless we are able to adapt to the changing conditions. Technological advances could render our products obsolete, and we may not be able to respond effectively to the technological requirements of evolving markets. As a result, we will be required to expend substantial funds for and commit significant resources to:\n\u25cf continue research and development activities on all product lines;\n\u25cf hire additional engineering and other technical personnel; and\n\u25cf purchase advanced design tools and test equipment.\nOur business could be harmed if we are unable to develop and utilize new technologies that address the needs of our customers, or our competitors do so more effectively than we do.\nOur efforts to continue to develop new products and technologies may not result in commercial success, which could cause a decline in our revenue and otherwise harm our business.\nOur research and development efforts with respect to our products and technologies may not result in customer or market acceptance. Some or all of such products and technologies may not successfully make the transition from the research and development lab to cost-effective production as a result of technology problems, competitive cost issues, yield problems and other factors. Even when we successfully complete a research and development effort with respect to a particular product or technology, our customers may decide not to introduce or may discontinue products utilizing the product or technology for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n\u25cf difficulties with other suppliers of components for the products;\n\u25cf superior technologies developed by our competitors and unfavorable comparisons of our solutions with these technologies;\n\u25cf price considerations; and\n\u25cf lack of anticipated or actual market demand for the products.\nThe nature of MTI Instruments\u2019 business will require us to make continuing investments to develop new products and technologies. Significant expenses relating to one or more new products or technologies that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful for any reason could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, any investments or acquisitions made to enhance our products and technologies may prove to be unsuccessful. If our efforts are unsuccessful, our business could be harmed. Moreover, when we announce our development of new products, sales of current products may decrease as customers delay making purchases until such new products are available, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and results of operations.\nThe cyclical nature of the industries of many of MTI Instruments\u2019 existing and target customers may result in fluctuations in our operating results.\nDemand for our products and services in our target markets is cyclical, and revenues from the sale of our products and services can vary significantly from one period to the next as a result. We may sell a significant amount of our products to one or a few customers for various short-term projects in one period, and then have markedly decreased sales in following periods as these projects end or customers have the products they require for the foreseeable future.\nThe electronics and military industries in particular have experienced significant economic downturns at various times. These downturns are characterized by diminished product demand, accelerated erosion of average selling prices and production overcapacity. We may seek to reduce our exposure to industry downturns by providing design and production services for leading companies in rapidly expanding industry segments. We may, however, experience substantial period-to-period fluctuations in future operating results because of general industry conditions or events occurring in the general economy.\nInternational sales risks could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, our operating results could be adversely affected by changes to U.S. policy and fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies.\nSales outside of the United States accounted for approximately 35.9% of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021 and 25.9% of total product revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020. Our international business may be adversely affected by changing political and economic conditions in foreign countries. Having a worldwide distribution network for our products exposes us to various economic, political and other risks that could adversely affect our operations and operating results, including the following:\n\u25cf export restrictions and controls relating to technology;\n\u25cf the burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of existing and new foreign regulatory requirements and laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and similar laws in other jurisdictions, and unexpected changes in such regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf laws and business practices favoring local companies, including tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods;\n\u25cf timing to meet regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf developments with respect to and any impact of tariffs and other trade barrier restrictions;\n\u25cf longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;\n\u25cf potentially reduced protection for, and difficulties in enforcing, intellectual property rights; and\n\u25cf political or economic instability in certain parts of the world.\nThese risks or any combination of them could increase our costs, lengthen our sales cycle and require significant management attention and could otherwise negatively affect our business, operating results, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we transact our business in U.S. dollars and bill and collect our sales in U.S. dollars. It is possible that U.S. policy changes and uncertainty about policy could increase market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Market volatility and currency exchange rate fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial condition related to transactions denominated in a foreign currency. A weakening of the dollar could cause our overseas vendors to require renegotiation of either the prices or currency we pay for their goods and services. Similarly, a strengthening of the dollar could cause our products to be more expensive for our international customers, which could impact price and margins and/or cause the demand for our products, and thus our revenue, to decline.\nIn the future, customers may negotiate pricing and make payments in non-U.S. currencies. If our overseas vendors or customers require us to transact business in non-U.S. currencies, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our cost of goods, operating expenses and operating margins and could result in exchange losses. In addition, currency devaluation can result in a loss to us if we hold deposits of that currency. Hedging foreign currencies can be difficult, especially if the currency is not freely traded. We cannot predict the impact that future exchange rate fluctuations may have on our operating results.\nRisks Related to our Company Generally\nOur confidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information, which could limit our ability to compete.\nWhile we are currently in the process of applying for patents with respect to SCI\u2019s business, presently we rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology and processes. Despite such protection, however, it is possible that a third party may copy or otherwise obtain and use our U.S. Patent and Trademark Office-registered or other proprietary information without our authorization, and trade secrets can be difficult to protect. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property and trade secrets is difficult, particularly in light of the global nature of the Internet and because the laws of other countries may afford us little or no effective protection of our intellectual property. Potentially expensive litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Additionally, we enter into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and other advisors. These agreements generally require that the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties confidential information developed by the party under such agreements or made known to the party by us during the course of the party\u2019s relationship with us. Our employees, consultants and other advisors, however, may not honor these agreements and enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult, expensive and time-consuming and the outcome is unpredictable. Our failure to obtain and maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive position.\nWe rely on highly-skilled personnel and the continuing efforts of our executive officers and, if we are unable to retain, motivate or hire qualified personnel, our business may be severely disrupted. In addition, increased labor costs and the unavailability of skilled workers could hurt our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur performance largely depends on the talents, knowledge, skills, know-how and efforts of highly skilled individuals and in particular, the expertise held by our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Toporek. His absence, were it to occur, would materially and adversely impact development and implementation of our projects and businesses. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract, among others, new technology developers and to retain and motivate our existing contractors. If one or more of our executive officers or other key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to replace them readily, if at all. In such case, our business may be severely disrupted, and we may incur additional expenses to recruit and retain new officers or other key personnel. In addition, if any of our executives or key personnel joins a competitor or forms a competing company, we may lose customers.\nIn addition, we compete with other businesses in our industries and other similar employers to attract and retain qualified personnel with the technical skills and experience required to successfully operate our businesses. The demand for skilled workers is high and the supply is limited, and a shortage in the labor pool of skilled workers or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain personnel and could require us to enhance our wage and benefits packages, which could increase our operating costs.\nBrookstone XXIV currently has a controlling interest in the Company due to the number of shares of common stock that it beneficially owns and its designation of two of our directors.\nAs of March 28, 2022, Brookstone XXIV owned approximately 26.9% of the Company\u2019s outstanding shares of Common Stock and has designated two directors that sit on our ten-member Board. Accordingly, Brookstone XXIV has the ability to exert a significant degree of influence or actual control over our management and affairs and, as a practical matter, will control corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, irrespective of how our other stockholders may vote, including the election of directors, amendments to our articles of incorporation, as amended (\u201cArticles of Incorporation\u201d) and our bylaws (\u201cBylaws\u201d), and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions, including a sale of substantially all of our assets, and Brookstone XXIV may vote its shares in a manner that is adverse to the interests of our minority stockholders. This concentration of voting control could deprive holders of our Common Stock of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of our Common Stock as part of a sale of the Company. Further, Brookstone XXIV\u2019s control position might adversely affect the market prices of our securities to the extent investors perceive disadvantages in owning shares of a company with a controlling stockholder.\nBrookstone XXIV and its director designees may acquire interests and positions that could present potential conflicts with our and our stockholders\u2019 interests.\nBrookstone XXIV and its director designees may make investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. Brookstone XXIV and its director designees may also pursue, for their own accounts, acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities might not be available to us. As part of our sale of 3,750,000 shares of our Common Stock to Brookstone XXIV in October 2016 and as required by Brookstone XXIV as a condition to purchasing the shares, our Board renounced, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company\u2019s expectancy with respect to being offered an opportunity to participate in any business opportunity that is discovered by or presented to a director designee (a \u201cBusiness Opportunity\u201d), whether in such director designee\u2019s capacity as a director of the Company or otherwise. Accordingly, the interests of Brookstone XXIV and the designated directors with respect to a Business Opportunity may supersede ours, and Brookstone XXIV or its affiliates or the Brookstone XXIV-designated directors may be involved with businesses that compete with us and may pursue opportunities for the sole benefit of Brookstone XXIV and its affiliates without our involvement, for which we have limited recourse. Such actions on the part of Brookstone XXIV or its director designees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, Michael Toporek, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, serves as the Managing General Partner of Brookstone XXIV. As a result of the potential conflicts inherent in his serving in both roles, it is possible that Mr. Toporek could make decisions that benefit Brookstone XXIV at the expense of the Company.\nInsiders continue to have substantial control over the Company.\nAs of March 28, 2022, the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers held the current right to vote approximately 31.1% of the Company\u2019s outstanding voting stock. Of this total, 26.9% was owned or controlled by Brookstone XXIV, for which Michael Toporek, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, also serves as Managing General Partner. In addition, the Company\u2019s directors and executive officers have the right to acquire additional shares of our Common Stock by exercising their equity awards under our equity compensation plans, which could increase their voting percentage significantly. As a result, Mr. Toporek acting alone, and/or many of the Company\u2019s officers and directors acting together, may have the ability to exert significant control over the Company\u2019s decisions and control the management and affairs of the Company, and also to determine the outcome of matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election or removal of a director, and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may harm the future market prices of our securities by:\n\u25cf delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company;\n\u25cf impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving the Company; or\n\u25cf discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.\nWe are subject to complex environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant liabilities for penalties, damages or costs of remediation or compliance.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern matters such as: the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; the generation, use, storage, handling, treatment, packaging, transportation, exposure to, and disposal of hazardous and biological materials, including recordkeeping, reporting and registration requirements; and the health and safety of our employees. We may incur significant additional costs beyond those currently contemplated to comply with these regulatory requirements. Further, if we fail to comply with these requirements we may be exposed to fines, penalties and/or interruptions in our operations that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Certain environmental laws may impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed or otherwise released into the environment, even under circumstances where the hazardous substances were released by prior owners or operators or the activities conducted and from which a release emanated complied with applicable law.\nFurther, existing regulations, particularly in the environmental area, could be revised or reinterpreted, or new laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities and future changes in environmental laws and regulations could occur, including potential regulatory and enforcement developments related to air emissions, any of which could result in significant additional costs. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Recent Acquisition of Soluna Callisto\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of our recent acquisition of Soluna Callisto.\nThe success of the recent Soluna Callisto acquisition will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s and SCI\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining the businesses of Soluna Callisto and SCI. To realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings, however, we must successfully combine the businesses of Soluna Callisto and SCI. If we are unable to successfully combine the businesses of Soluna Callisto and SCI, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\nUntil October 29, 2021, Soluna Callisto and SCI operated independently, and we are still in the process of integrating the companies\u2019 operations. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees and the disruption of the merged company\u2019s ongoing business, which could have a negative impact on our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger. Integration efforts between the two companies may, to some extent, also divert management\u2019s attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each SHI and SCI during the current transition period.\nOur operating results will suffer if SHI and SCI do not effectively manage the increased scale of SCI\u2019s operations and the optimization and expansion opportunities.\nFollowing its acquisition of Soluna Callisto, SCI is larger and more diverse than it was prior to the acquisition transaction. Its future success will depend, in part, upon its ability to manage its optimization and expansion opportunities, which may pose substantial challenges for SCI to integrate new operations into its existing business in an efficient and timely manner, and upon its ability to successfully monitor its operations, costs and regulatory compliance, and to maintain other necessary internal controls. There is no assurance that SCI\u2019s optimization and expansion opportunities will be successful, or that it will realize its expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies or other expected benefits of its acquisition of Soluna Callisto.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe are heavily dependent on our senior management, and a loss of a member of our senior management team could cause the market prices of our securities to suffer.\nIf we lose the services of Michael Toporek, our Chief Executive Officer and a member of our board of directors, Jessica L. Thomas, our Chief Financial Officer, David C. Michaels, our Chairman of the Board, and/or certain key employees, we may not be able to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis, and our business could be adversely affected. We do not currently maintain key life insurance policies on these officers or key employees. Our existing operations and continued future development depend to a significant extent upon the performance and active participation of these individuals and certain key employees. We may not be successful in retaining the services of these individuals, and if we were to lose any of these individuals, we may not be able to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may incur losses and liabilities in the course of business that could prove costly to defend or resolve.\nCompanies that operate in one or more of the businesses that we operate face significant legal risks. There is a risk that we could become involved in litigation wherein an adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition. There is a risk of litigation generally in conducting a commercial business, and we are, at times, involved in commercial disputes with third parties, such as customers, distributors and vendors. These risks often may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude often remain unknown for substantial periods of time. We may incur significant legal expenses in defending against litigation.\nWe may become subject to claims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others, which could prohibit us from selling our products, require us to obtain licenses from third parties or to develop non-infringing alternatives, and subject us to substantial monetary damages and injunctive relief.\nWe may receive notices from third parties that the manufacture, use or sale of any products we develop infringes upon one or more claims of their patents. Moreover, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications, unknown to us, that may later result in issued patents that materially and adversely affect our business. Third parties could also assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us with respect to our future product offerings, if any. We cannot be certain that we have not infringed the intellectual property rights of any third parties. Any infringement or misappropriation claim could result in significant costs, substantial damages and our inability to manufacture, market or sell any of our product offerings that are found to infringe another person\u2019s patent. Even if we were to prevail in any such action, the litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of resources that could materially and adversely affect our business. If a court determined, or if we independently discovered, that our product offerings violated third-party proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that we would be able to re-engineer our product offerings to avoid those rights or obtain a license under those rights on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. As a result, we could be prohibited from selling products that are found to infringe upon the rights of others. Even if obtaining a license were feasible, it may be costly and time-consuming. A court could also enter orders that temporarily, preliminarily, or permanently enjoin us from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products that are found to infringe on third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, or could enter orders mandating that we undertake certain remedial actions. Further, a court could order us to pay compensatory damages for any such infringement, plus prejudgment interest, and could in addition treble the compensatory damages and award attorneys\u2019 fees. Any such payments could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to protect our information systems against service interruption or failure, misappropriation of data or breaches of security, our operations could be disrupted, we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions and private litigation and our reputation may be damaged.\nOur business involves the collection, storage and transmission of personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees. Our information systems also contain the Company\u2019s proprietary and other confidential information related to our business. Our efforts to protect such information may be unsuccessful due to the actions of third parties, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, catastrophic events, employee error or malfeasance or other attempts to harm our systems. As the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems, change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or timely implement adequate preventative measures. We could also experience a loss of critical data and delays or interruptions in our ability to manage inventories or process transactions. Some of our commercial partners, such as those that help us maintain our website, may receive or store information provided by us or our users through our website. If these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate information security practices, or fail to comply with our policies in this regard, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our customers\u2019 or employees\u2019 information may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.\nIf our systems are harmed or fail to function properly, we may need to expend significant financial resources to repair or replace systems or to otherwise protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. If we experience a significant security breach or fail to detect and appropriately respond to a significant security breach, we could be exposed to costly legal actions against us in connection with such incidents, which could result in orders or judgments forcing us to pay damages or fines or to take certain actions with respect to our information systems. Any incidents involving unauthorized access to or improper use of user information, or incidents that are a violation of our online privacy policies, could harm our brand reputation and diminish our competitive position. Any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business, reputation or financial results. Our insurance policies carry coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches.\nOur risk management process may not identify all risks that we are subject to and will not eliminate all risk.\nOur Enterprise Risk Management (\u201cERM\u201d) process seeks to identify and address significant risks. Our ERM process uses the most recent integrated risk framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to assess, manage and monitor risks. We believe that risk-taking is an inherent aspect of the pursuit of our growth and performance strategy. Our goals are to proactively manage risks in a structured approach in conjunction with strategic planning, with the intent to preserve and enhance shareowner value, and to manage prudently, rather than wholly avoiding, risks. We can mitigate risks and their impact on the Company, however, only to a limited extent, and no ERM process can identify all risks that we may face. Therefore, there may be risks that we are currently unaware of, that may develop in the future or that we currently consider immaterial. Further, our management of risks may prove inadequate. The emergence of risks of which we were unaware or are unable to manage could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s officers and directors are indemnified against certain conduct that may prove costly to defend.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws generally provide broad indemnification to our officers and directors against judgments, fines, amounts paid in settlement and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees actually incurred in connection with most actions or proceedings to which they are or are threatened to be made a party that relates to their service as an officer or director, except as limited as set forth therein. We are also obligated to advance expenses as they are incurred by a director or officer in defending an action or proceeding prior to final disposition upon receipt of an undertaking by the applicable person to repay such advanced amount if the advancement is ultimately found to not be permitted by law or otherwise.\nIn addition, the Nevada Revised Statutes (the \u201cNRS\u201d) provides that no director or officer is individually liable for damages as a result of an act or failure to act in his or her capacity as a director or officer except if (i) the presumption that such director or officer acted in good faith, on an informed basis and with a view to the interests of the Company is rebutted, and (ii) it is proven that such director\u2019s or officer\u2019s act or failure to act constituted a breach of his or her fiduciary duties as a director or officer, and such breach involved intentional misconduct, fraud or a knowing violation of law. Consequently, subject to the applicable provisions of the NRS and to certain limited exceptions in the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, the Company\u2019s officers and directors will not be liable to the Company or to its stockholders for monetary damages resulting from their conduct as an officer or director. As a result, we may have to spend significant resources indemnifying our officers and directors or paying for damages caused by their conduct.\nWe rely on the ability to secure funding via our credit facility when accepting large orders from certain customers, and if we are not able to retain our existing credit facility or obtain new ones we may not be able to accept these large orders, and our business, revenues, and financial condition could suffer.\nFor some large customer orders, particularly if the customer requires unusually long payment terms, we may need to rely on funding from our credit facility to meet our ongoing funding needs because we may have to pay for the raw materials needed to manufacture the products for the customer before the customer pays us. While we had historically not needed to do this, the possibility following the placement of a large order in 2020 was the reason we arranged for a credit facility last year. If we are unable to maintain the credit facility or arrange a replacement facility on satisfactory terms and conditions, we may not be able to accept these types of customer orders, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, revenues, and results of operations, as well as our ability to continue to fund our operations including our product development and customer growth activities. We may also need to obtain a new credit facility to fund our business plans. Our ability to maintain or replace our existing credit facility or obtain new or additional financing will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in needed quantities, on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert management\u2019s attention.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and other applicable securities rules and regulations. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual and current reports with the SEC with respect to our business and operating results. Compliance with these rules and regulations increases our legal and financial compliance costs, makes some activities more difficult, time-consuming, or costly, and increases demand on our systems and resources. As a result of disclosure of information in this Report and in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition is more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be harmed, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert resources of our management and harm our business and operating results.\nRisks Related to our Securities\nThe market price of our securities are likely be volatile, which may cause investment losses for our shareholders.\nThe market price of our securities has been and is likely to continue to be volatile, and investors in our securities may experience a decrease, which could be substantial, in the value of their securities or the loss of their entire investment in the Company for a number of reasons, including reasons unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. The market price of our securities could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a broad and diverse range of factors, including those described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section as well as the following:\n\u25cf announcements by us regarding liquidity, significant acquisitions, equity investments and divestitures, addition or loss of significant customers and contracts, capital expenditure commitments and litigation;\n\u25cf our issuance of securities or debt, particularly if in connection with acquisition activities;\n\u25cf the sale of a significant number of shares of our common stock by shareholders;\n\u25cf recent changes in financial condition or results of operations, such as in earnings, revenues or other measure of company value;\n\u25cf general market and economic conditions; and\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations or new product introductions by us or our competitors.\nFurther, broad market and industry factors may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our securities regardless of our actual operating performance.\nIn addition, stock markets have experienced in the past and may in the future experience a high level of price and volume volatility, and the market prices of equity securities of many companies have experienced in the past and may in the future experience wide price fluctuations not necessarily related to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our securities.\nFinally, our relatively small public float and daily trading volume have in the past caused, and may in the future result in, significant volatility in the price of our securities. At December 31, 2021, we had approximately 9,417,833 million shares of our common stock outstanding held by non-affiliates and 1,252,299 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock. Our daily trading volume for the year ended December 31, 2021 averaged approximately 151,401 shares of common stock and 387,513 shares of Series A Preferred Stock.\nBecause there has been limited precedent set for financial accounting of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency assets, the determination that we have made for how to account for cryptocurrency assets transactions may be subject to change.\nBecause there has been limited precedent set for the financial accounting of cryptocurrencies and related revenue recognition and no official guidance has yet been provided by the FASB or the SEC, it is unclear how companies may in the future be required to account for cryptocurrency transactions and assets and related revenue recognition. A change in regulatory or financial accounting standards could result in the necessity to change our accounting methods and restate our financial statements. Such a restatement could adversely affect the accounting for our newly mined cryptocurrency rewards and more generally negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Such circumstances would have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue as a going concern or to pursue our new strategy at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects or operations as well as and potentially the value of any cryptocurrencies we hold or expect to acquire for our own account and harm our investors.\nIf we are not able to comply with the applicable continued listing requirements or standards of Nasdaq, Nasdaq could delist our common stock or Series A Preferred Stock or broker-dealers may be discouraged from effecting transactions in shares of our securities.\nOur common stock became listed and commenced trading on Nasdaq on March 23, 2020 and our Series A Preferred Stock commenced trading on Nasdaq on August 19, 2021. In order to maintain such listings, we must satisfy minimum financial and other continued listing requirements and standards, including those regarding director independence and independent committee requirements, minimum stockholders\u2019 equity, minimum share price and certain corporate governance requirements. There can be no assurances that we will be able to comply with such applicable listing standards. If we fail to do so, Nasdaq may delist our common stock and Series A Preferred Stock, which would likely have an adverse impact on the market price and liquidity of such securities.\nIn addition, our shares of common stock have in the past constituted, and may again in the future constitute, \u201cpenny stock\u201d within the meaning of Section 3(a)(51) of the Exchange Act and Rule 3a-51-1 thereunder, and so will be subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules adopted under Section 15(g) (now 15(h)) of the Exchange Act. The penny stock rules generally apply to companies whose common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange and trades at less than $5.00 per share, other than companies that have had average revenue of at least $6,000,000 for the last three years or that have tangible net worth of at least $5,000,000 ($2,000,000 if the company has been operating for three or more years). These rules require, among other things, that brokers who trade penny stocks to persons other than \u201cestablished customers\u201d complete certain documentation, make suitability inquiries of investors, and provide investors with certain information concerning trading in the security, including a risk disclosure document and quote information under certain circumstances. Many brokers have decided not to trade penny stocks because of the requirements of the penny stock rules and, as a result, the number of broker-dealers willing to act as market makers in such securities is limited. If our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules for any significant period, it could have an adverse effect on the market, if any, for our common stock. If the common stock is subject to the penny stock rules, investors will find it more difficult to dispose of their shares of our common stock.\nRaising additional funds through debt or equity financing could be dilutive and may cause the market price of our securities to decline. We still may need to raise additional funding which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Failure to obtain additional capital may force us to delay, limit or terminate our product development efforts or other operations.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a shareholder. Furthermore, any additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our products and services. In addition, the sale of a significant number of our shares of common stock, either by us or by our shareholders (in particular Brookstone, our largest shareholder) could depress the price of our securities.\nWe estimate that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient for us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. We may continue to seek funds through equity or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements with corporate sources, or through other sources of financing. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Any failure to raise capital as and when needed, as a result of insufficient authorized shares or otherwise, could have a negative impact on our financial condition and on our ability to pursue our business plans and strategies.", "PERMNO": 52231, "SIC": 3829, "TIC": "MKTY"}
