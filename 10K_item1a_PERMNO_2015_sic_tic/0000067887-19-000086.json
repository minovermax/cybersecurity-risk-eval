The markets we serve are sensitive to fluctuations in general business cycles, domestic and foreign governmental tariff, trade and monetary policies, and economic conditions and events. For example, our defense programs are largely contingent on U.S. Department of Defense funding. In addition, our space programs rely on the same governmental funding as well as investment for commercial and exploration activities. Our aerospace programs are dependent on the highly cyclical commercial airline industry, driven by fuel price increases, demand for travel and economic conditions. Demand for our industrial products is dependent upon several factors, including capital investment, product innovations, economic growth, the price of oil and natural gas, cost-reduction efforts and technology upgrades. If global economic uncertainties continue or economic conditions deteriorate, our operations could be negatively impacted through declines in our sales, profitability and cash flows due to lower orders, payment delays and price pressures for our products.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets with competitors who may have greater resources than we possess. Many of our products are sold in highly competitive markets. Some of our competitors, especially in our industrial markets and medical markets, are larger, more diversified and have greater financial, marketing, production and research and development resources. Within the aerospace industry, suppliers have consolidated to widen their product offerings and secure long-term sole-source positions. As a result, these competitors may be better able to withstand the effects of periodic economic downturns, and their program wins could reduce the total number of viable suppliers and increase their market share. Our sales and operating margins will be negatively impacted if our competitors:\n\u2022\ndevelop products that are superior to our products,\n\u2022\ndevelop products of comparable quality and performance that are more competitively priced than our products,\n\u2022\ndevelop more efficient and effective manufacturing methods for their products and services, or\n\u2022\nadapt more quickly than we do to technological innovations or evolving customer requirements.\nWe believe that the principal points of competition in our markets are product quality, reliability, design and engineering capabilities, price, innovation, conformity to customers' specifications, timeliness of delivery, effectiveness of the distribution organization and quality of support after the sale. Maintaining or improving our competitive position requires continued investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. If we do not maintain sufficient resources to make these investments, are not successful in meeting our quality or delivery standards or are not successful in maintaining our competitive position, we could face pricing pressures or loss in market share, causing our operations and financial performance to suffer.\nWe depend heavily on government contracts that may not be fully funded or may be terminated, and the failure to receive funding or the termination of one or more of these contracts could reduce our sales and increase our costs. Sales to the U.S. Government and its prime contractors and subcontractors represent a significant portion of our business. In 2019, sales under U.S. Government contracts represented 35% of our total sales, primarily within Aircraft Controls and Space and Defense Controls. Sales to foreign governments represented 7% of our total sales. Funding for government programs can be structured into a series of individual contracts and depend on annual congressional appropriations, which are cyclical. At times when there are perceived threats to national security, U.S. Defense spending can increase; at other times, defense spending can decrease. Future levels of defense spending beyond 2019 are uncertain and subject to congressional debate. Any reduction in future Department of Defense spending levels could adversely impact our sales, operating profit and our cash flow. We have resources applied to specific government contracts and if any of those contracts are rescheduled or terminated, we may incur substantial costs redeploying those resources.\nWe make estimates in accounting for over-time contracts, and changes in these estimates may have significant impacts on our earnings. We have over-time contracts with some of our customers. These contracts are predominantly within Aircraft Controls and Space and Defense Controls. Revenue representing 64% of 2019 sales was accounted for using an input method that uses costs incurred to measure progress toward completion (\"cost-to-cost\"). Under this method, we recognize revenue as work progresses toward completion as determined by the ratio of cumulative costs incurred to date to estimated total contract costs at completion, multiplied by the total estimated contract revenue, less cumulative revenue recognized in prior periods. Changes in these required estimates could have a material adverse effect on sales and profits. Any adjustments are recognized in the period in which the change becomes known using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting. For contracts with anticipated losses at completion, we establish a provision for the entire amount of the estimated remaining loss and charge it against income in the period in which the loss becomes known and can be reasonably estimated. Amounts representing performance incentives, penalties, contract claims or impacts of scope change negotiations are considered in estimating revenues, costs and profits when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable. Due to the substantial judgments involved with this process, our actual results could differ materially or could be settled unfavorably from our estimates.\nWe enter into fixed-price contracts, which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns. In 2019, fixed-price contracts represented 91% of our sales that were accounted for using the cost-to-cost method. On fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the scope of work specified in the contract for a predetermined price. Depending on the fixed price negotiated, these contracts may provide us with an opportunity to achieve higher profits based on the relationship between our total contract costs and the contract's fixed price. However, we bear the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce our profit or cause us to incur a loss on the contract, which would reduce our net earnings. Contract loss reserves are most commonly associated with fixed-price contracts that involve the design and development of innovative control systems to meet the customer's specifications.\nWe may not realize the full amounts reflected in our backlog as revenue, which could adversely affect our future revenue and growth prospects. As of September 28, 2019, our total backlog was $2.2 billion, which represents confirmed orders we believe will be recognized as revenue. There is no assurance that our customers will purchase all the orders represented in our backlog, due in part to governments' abilities to modify, curtail or terminate major programs. Due to the uncertain nature of our contracts with the U.S. Government and other foreign governments, we may never realize revenue from some of the orders that are included in our backlog. A portion of our backlog also relates to commercial aircraft programs as well as industrial programs. If there are aircraft entry into service delays, lower than anticipated aircraft deliveries due to production issues or overall weakening economic outlooks, we may never realize the full amounts included in our backlog. If this occurs, our future revenue and growth prospects may be adversely affected.\nIf our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our prime contract performance and our ability to obtain future business could be materially and adversely impacted. We rely on subcontracts with other companies to perform portions of the service we provide to our customers on many of our contracts. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor, customer concerns about the subcontractor, our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract or our hiring of personnel of a subcontractor. Failure by our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon, defect-free supplies, or perform the agreed-upon services, may materially and adversely impact our ability to perform our obligations as the prime contractor. Subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer terminating our contract for default. A default termination could expose us to liability and substantially impair our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, a delay or failure in our ability to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations to our customers.\nWe may not be able to prevent, or timely detect, issues with our products and our manufacturing processes which may adversely affect our operations and our earnings. We must continuously improve product development and manufacturing processes and systems to ensure we deliver high-quality, technically advanced products. Due to growth in operations, there is a risk our current manufacturing processes and systems are unable to maintain our high-quality and on-time delivery standards for our customers. If we are unable to maintain these standards, we could experience late deliveries and penalties, recalls, increased warranty costs, order cancellations and litigation.\nContracting on government programs is subject to significant regulation, including rules related to bidding, billing and accounting kickbacks, and any false claims or non-compliance could subject us to fines, penalties or possible debarment. Like all government contractors, we are subject to risks associated with this contracting, including substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by U.S. and foreign government agencies and authorities. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in our progress payments being withheld or our suspension or debarment from future government contracts, which could have a material affect on our operational and financial results.\nThe loss of The Boeing Company as a customer or a significant reduction in sales to The Boeing Company could adversely impact our operating results. We provide The Boeing Company, or Boeing, with controls for both military and commercial applications, which totaled 13% of our 2019 sales. Sales to Boeing's commercial airplane group are generally made under a long-term supply agreements. Boeing operates in a competitive environment and continues to evaluate the size, scope and cost of their supplier base. Any detrimental impact to Boeing's production rates or a reduction in our awarded content could reduce our orders from Boeing. A reduction in sales or the loss of Boeing as a customer could reduce our sales and earnings.\nOur new products and technology research and development efforts are substantial and may not be successful which could reduce our sales and earnings. Technologies related to our products have undergone, and in the future may undergo, significant changes. In order to maintain a leadership position in the high-performance, precision controls market in future, we have incurred, and we expect to continue to incur, expenses associated with lengthy research and development activities during the introduction of new products. Our technology has been developed through customer-funded and internally-funded research and development, as well as through business acquisitions. If we fail to predict customers' preferences or fail to provide viable technological solutions, we may experience inefficiencies that could delay or prevent the acceptance of new products or product enhancements. Also, the research and development expenses we incur may exceed our cost estimates and the new products we develop may not generate sales sufficient to offset our costs. Additionally, our competitors may develop technologies and products that have more competitive advantages than ours and render our technology uncompetitive or obsolete.\nOur inability to adequately enforce and protect our intellectual property or defend against assertions of infringement could prevent or restrict our ability to compete. Protecting our intellectual property is critical in order to maintain a competitive advantage. We therefore rely on internally developed and acquired patents, trademarks, proprietary knowledge and technologies. Our inability to defend against the unauthorized use of these rights and assets could have an adverse effect on our competitive position and on our results of operations and financial condition. Litigation may be necessary to protect our intellectual property rights or defend against claims of infringement. This litigation could result in significant costs and divert management's focus away from operations.\nOur business operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions, intrusions or new software implementations. We are dependent on various information technologies throughout our company and third parties to administer, store and support multiple business activities. In addition, we store sensitive data including proprietary business information, intellectual property and confidential employee data on our servers and databases. Furthermore, we may have access to sensitive, confidential or personal information that may be subject to privacy and security laws and controls. Although we continue to review and enhance our computer systems and cybersecurity controls, information system disruptions, equipment failures or cybersecurity attacks, such as unauthorized access, malicious software and other intrusions, could still occur and may lead to potential data corruption and exposure of proprietary and confidential information. Any intrusion may cause operational stoppages, fines, penalties, diminished competitive advantages through reputational damages and increased operational costs. Additionally, we may incur additional costs to comply with our customers', including the U.S. Government's, increased cybersecurity protections and standards in our products. Prior cyberattacks directed at us have not had a material impact on our financial results. In addition, we have embarked on a multi-year business information system transformation and standardization project. This endeavor will occupy additional resources, diverting attention from other operational activities, may cause our information systems to perform unexpectedly and may increase our exposure to cyber risks. While we expect to invest significant resources throughout the planning and project management process, unanticipated delays could occur and would adversely affect our financial results.\nOur indebtedness and restrictive covenants under our credit facilities could limit our operational and financial flexibility. We have incurred significant indebtedness, and may incur additional debt for acquisitions, operations, research and development and capital expenditures. Our ability to make interest and scheduled principal payments and operate within the restrictive covenants could be adversely impacted by changes in the availability, terms and cost of capital, changes in interest rates or changes in our credit ratings or our outlook. These changes could increase our cost of business, limiting our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, react to market conditions and meet operational and capital needs, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage.\nSignificant changes in discount rates, rates of return on pension assets, mortality tables and other factors could adversely affect our earnings and equity and increase our pension funding requirements. Pension costs and obligations are determined using actual results as well as actuarial valuations that involve several assumptions. The most critical assumptions are the discount rate, the long-term expected return on assets and mortality tables. Other assumptions include salary increases and retirement age. Some of these assumptions, such as the discount rate and return on pension assets, are reflective of economic conditions and largely out of our control. Despite fully funding our largest pension plan, changes in the pension assumptions could adversely affect our earnings, equity and funding requirements.\nA write-off of all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our operating results and net worth. Goodwill and other intangible assets are a substantial portion of our assets. At September 28, 2019, goodwill was $784 million and other intangible assets were $80 million of our total assets of $3.1 billion. Our goodwill and other intangible assets may increase in the future since our growth strategy includes acquisitions. However, we may have to write off all or part of our goodwill or other intangible assets if their value becomes impaired. Although this write-off would be a non-cash charge, it could reduce our earnings and our financial condition significantly.\nOur sales and earnings may be affected if we cannot identify, acquire or integrate strategic acquisitions, or if we engage in divesting activities. Acquisitions are a key part of our growth strategy. Our historical growth has depended, and our future growth is likely to depend, in part, on our ability to successfully identify, acquire and integrate acquired businesses. We intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities, both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world. Growth by acquisition involves risk that could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. We may not know the potential exposure to unanticipated liabilities. Additionally, the expected benefits or synergies might not be fully realized, integrating operations and personnel may be slowed and key employees, suppliers or customers of the acquired business may depart. We may also continue to engage in divesting activities if we deem the operations as non-strategic or underperforming. Divestitures could adversely affect our profitability and, under certain circumstances, require us to record impairment charges or a loss as a result of a transaction. In pursuing acquisition opportunities, integrating acquired businesses, or divesting business operations, management's time and attention may be diverted from our core business, while consuming resources and incurring expenses for these activities.\nOur operations in foreign countries expose us to political and currency risks and adverse changes in local legal and regulatory environments. We have significant manufacturing and sales operations in foreign countries. In addition, our domestic operations sell to foreign customers. In 2019, 39% of our net sales were to customers outside of the United States. Our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies and by the translation of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from local currencies into U.S. dollars. We expect international operations and export sales to contribute to our earnings for the foreseeable future. Both the sales from international operations and export sales are subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside of the United States. Such risks include the possibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations including privacy laws protecting personal data, changes in tariff and trade barriers and import or export licensing requirements. In addition, any local or global health issue or uncertain political climates, international hostilities, natural disasters, or any other terrorist activities could adversely affect customer demand, our operations and our ability to source and deliver products and services to our customers.\nThe United Kingdom's decision to exit the European Union may bring short-term and long-term adverse impacts on our results of operations. In 2019, our United Kingdom operations represented approximately 7% of our consolidated net sales across all three segments. The outcome of the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (\"Brexit\") could adversely affect our business and our results of operations. In the short-term, volatility in the British Pound could continue, which would negatively impact our financial results. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on our United Kingdom operations will depend on the outcome of yet-to-be negotiated tariff, trade, regulatory and other matters. While we have established cross-segment teams and adopted measures to mitigate the potential risks within the current uncertain environment, such measures may negatively impact our operations and our financial results.\nEscalating tariffs, restrictions on imports or other trade barriers between the United States and various countries may impact our results of operations. There is currently significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and other countries, both where we source products and where we have large customers, with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs. The current U.S. administration has called for substantial changes to U.S. foreign trade policy including imposing greater restrictions on international trade with significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the U.S. In the near-term, we expect these tariffs will negatively impact our costs to in-source materials, primarily from China, which could negatively impact our operating results. In the longer-term, these tariffs may negatively impact customer order volume, specifically related to the new European commercial aircraft, if the resulting higher prices for aircraft restrict future orders. The potential loss of orders would negatively impact our financial results including lower sales, operating profits and cash flow.\nUnforeseen exposure to additional income tax liabilities may affect our operating results. Our distribution of taxable income is subject to domestic and, as a result of our significant manufacturing and sales presence in foreign countries, foreign tax jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate and earnings may be affected by shifts in our mix of earnings in countries with varying statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and outcomes of any audits performed on previous tax returns. Additionally, any alterations to tax regulations or interpretations could have significant impacts on our effective tax rates and on our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nGovernment regulations could limit our ability to sell our products outside the United States and otherwise adversely affect our business. In 2019, approximately 19% of our sales were subject to compliance with the United States export regulations. Our failure to obtain, or fully adhere to the limitations contained in the requisite licenses, meet registration standards or comply with other government export regulations would hinder our ability to generate revenues from the sale of our products outside the United States. In addition, the U.S. Government has established and, from time to time, revises sanctions that restrict or prohibit U.S. companies and their subsidiaries from doing business with certain foreign countries, entities and individuals. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. In order to sell our products in European Union countries, we must satisfy certain technical requirements. If we are unable to comply with those requirements with respect to a significant quantity of our products, our sales in Europe would be restricted. Doing business internationally also subjects us to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including regulations relating to import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, anti-bribery, privacy regulations and anti-boycott provisions. From time to time, we may file voluntary disclosure reports with the U.S. Department of State and the Department of Commerce regarding certain violations of U.S. export laws and regulations discovered by us in the course of our business activities, employee training or internal reviews and audits. To date, our voluntary disclosures have not resulted in a fine, penalty, or export privilege denial or restriction that has materially impacted our financial condition or ability to export. Our failure, or failure by an authorized agent or representative that is attributable to us, to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil or criminal liabilities. In the extreme case, these failures could result in financial penalties, suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe failure or misuse of our products may damage our reputation, necessitate a product recall or result in claims against us that exceed our insurance coverage, thereby requiring us to pay significant damages. Defects in the design and manufacture of our products or our subcontractors' products may necessitate a product recall. We include complex system designs and components in our products that could contain errors or defects, particularly when we incorporate new technologies into our products. If any of our products are defective, we could be required to redesign or recall those products, pay substantial damages or warranty claims and face actions by regulatory bodies and government authorities. Such an event could result in significant expenses, delay sales, inflate inventory, affect our company's and our products' reputations, and cause us to withdraw from certain markets. We are also exposed to product liability claims. Many of our products are used in applications where their failure or misuse could result in significant property loss and serious personal injury or death. We carry product liability insurance consistent with industry norms. However, these insurance coverages may not be sufficient to fully cover the payment of any potential claim. A product recall or a product liability claim not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings, the outcome of which may be unfavorable to us. Our business may be adversely impacted by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. We estimate loss contingencies and establish reserves based on our assessment where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable given the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingencies recorded as liabilities.\nFuture terror attacks, war, natural disasters or other catastrophic events beyond our control could negatively impact our business. Terror attacks, war or other civil disturbances, natural disasters and other catastrophic events could lead to economic instability and decreased demand for commercial products, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. From time to time, terrorist attacks worldwide have caused instability in global financial markets and the aviation industry. In 2019, 24% of our net sales were in the commercial aircraft market. Also, our facilities and suppliers are located throughout the world and could be subject to damage from fires, floods, earthquakes or other natural or man-made disasters. Although we carry third party property insurance covering these and other risks, our inability to meet customers' schedules as a result of a catastrophe may result in the loss of customers or significantly increase costs, including penalty claims under customer contracts.\nOur operations are subject to environmental laws, and complying with those laws may cause us to incur significant costs. Our operations and facilities are subject to numerous stringent environmental laws and regulations. Although we believe that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations, future changes in these laws, regulations or interpretations of them, or changes in the nature of our operations may require us to make significant capital expenditures to ensure compliance. We have been and are currently involved in environmental remediation activities. The cost of these activities may become significant depending on the discovery of additional environmental exposures at sites that we currently own or operate, at sites that we formerly owned or operated, or at sites to which we have sent hazardous substances or wastes for treatment, recycling or disposal.", "PERMNO": 61807, "SIC": 3728, "TIC": "MOG.A"}
