{"cik": "769520", "company": "MIDDLEBY CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe company\u2019s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks including, but not limited to, those set forth below. Any of these risks, as well as risks not currently known to the company or that are currently deemed to be immaterial, may adversely affect the company\u2019s business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. These risk factors should be carefully considered together with the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the risks and uncertainties described under the heading Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\nEconomic Risks\nCurrent and future economic conditions could adversely affect the company\u2019s business and financial performance.\nThe company\u2019s operating results are impacted by the health of the North American, European, Asian and Latin American economies. The company\u2019s business and financial performance, including collection of its accounts receivable, may be adversely affected by current and future economic conditions that may cause a decline in business and consumer spending, a reduction in the availability of credit and decreased growth of its existing customers, resulting in customers electing to delay the replacement of aging equipment. Higher energy costs, rising interest rates, weakness in the residential construction, housing and home improvement markets, financial market volatility, recession and acts of terrorism may also adversely affect the company\u2019s business and financial performance. Additionally, the company may experience difficulties in scaling its operations due to economic pressures in the U.S. and international markets.\nUncertainty surrounding the terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets or the Company\u2019s business.\nIn June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum. On January 31, 2020, the U.K. officially exited the European Union and entered into a transition period to negotiate the final terms of Brexit. The transition period ended on December 31, 2020. The potential future impact of Brexit remains unclear and could adversely impact certain areas of labor and trade in addition to creating further short-term uncertainty and currency volatility. In the absence of a future trade deal, the U.K.\u2019s trade with the European Union and the rest of the world would be subject to tariffs and duties set by the World Trade Organization. Additionally, the movement of goods between the U.K. and the remaining member states of the European Union will be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks, leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure. These changes to the trading relationship between the U.K. and European Union would likely result in increased cost of goods imported into and exported from the U.K. and may decrease the profitability of the company's U.K. and other operations. Additional currency volatility could drive a weaker British pound, which increases the cost of goods imported into the U.K. and may decrease the profitability of the company's U.K. operations. Currency exchange rates for the British pound and the euro with respect to each other and to the U.S. dollar may be negatively affected by Brexit, which could cause volatility in our financial results. With a range of outcomes still possible, the impact from Brexit remains uncertain and will depend, in part, on the final outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations.\nThe company is subject to currency fluctuations and other risks from its operations outside the United States.\nThe company has manufacturing and distribution operations located in Asia, Europe and Latin America. The company\u2019s operations are subject to the impact of economic downturns, political instability and foreign trade restrictions, which may adversely affect the company\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results. The company anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of consolidated net sales in the foreseeable future. Some sales and operating costs of the company\u2019s foreign operations are realized in local currencies, and an increase in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against such currencies would lead to a reduction in consolidated sales and earnings. Additionally, foreign currency exposures are not fully hedged, and there can be no assurance that the company\u2019s future results of operations will not be adversely affected by currency fluctuations. Furthermore, currency fluctuations may affect the prices paid to the company\u2019s suppliers for materials the company uses in production. As a result, operating margins may also be negatively impacted by worldwide currency fluctuations that result in higher costs for certain cross-border transactions.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has, and likely will continue to, adversely impact and pose risks to the company, the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable.\nThe company is monitoring the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and taking steps to mitigate the risks posed by its spread, including working with its customers, employees, suppliers and other stakeholders. The pandemic is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, the company's financial results, condition and outlook. Certain elements of the company's business (including its supply chain, distribution systems, production levels and research and development activities) and operations have been negatively impacted due to significant portions of the company's workforce being unable to work effectively due to quarantines, government orders and guidance, facility closures, illness, travel restrictions, implementation of precautionary measures and other restrictions. The company also has experienced, and expects to continue to experience, volatility in demand given disruptions in global health, economic and market conditions, consumer behavior and global restaurant operations. If the pandemic continues and conditions worsen, the company expects to experience additional adverse impacts on operational and commercial activities, costs, customer orders and purchases and collections of accounts receivable, which may be material, and the extent of these exposures remains uncertain even if conditions begin to improve. The pandemic has also increased the risk related to the company's ability to ensure business continuity during a potential disruption, including increased cybersecurity attacks related to the work-from-home environment. Furthermore, the pandemic has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, all of which could continue to negatively impact the company. Due to the speed with which the situation is developing, the global breadth of the pandemic's spread and the range of governmental and community reactions, there is uncertainty around the pandemic's ultimate impact and the timing of recovery. Therefore, the pandemic could lead to an extended disruption of economic activity and the impact on the company's consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be material. In addition, the continuation or a resurgence of the pandemic could exacerbate the other risk factors.\nThe company\u2019s level of indebtedness could adversely affect its business, results of operations and growth strategy.\nThe company now has and may continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness. At January 2, 2021, the company had $1,729.6 million of borrowings and $10.9 million in letters of credit outstanding. In August 2020, the company issued $747.5 million aggregate principal amount of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the \"Convertible Notes\"), which bear interest semi-annually in arrears and mature on September 1, 2025 unless they are redeemed, repurchased or converted prior to such date in accordance with their terms. Upon conversion, the company can elect to pay or deliver, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, in respect of the remainder, if any, of the company's conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes being converted. Under certain circumstances, the holders of the Convertible Notes may require the company to repay all or a portion of the principal and interest outstanding under the Convertible Notes in cash prior to the maturity date, which could have an adverse effect on the company's financial results.\nTo the extent the company requires additional capital resources, there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on favorable terms, or at all. The unavailability of funds could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and ability to expand the company\u2019s operations.\nThe company\u2019s level of indebtedness could have adverse consequences to its business and operations, including the following:\n\u2022the company may be unable to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product development, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022a significant portion of the company\u2019s cash flow from operations must be dedicated to debt service, which reduces the amount of cash the company has available for other purposes;\n\u2022the company may be more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in the company\u2019s business or general economic and industry conditions and have limited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and/or industry;\n\u2022the company may be disadvantaged compared to its competitors that are less leveraged and thereby have greater financial flexibility; and\n\u2022the company may be restricted in its ability to make strategic acquisitions and to pursue new business opportunities.\nThe company\u2019s current credit agreement limits its ability to conduct business, which could negatively affect the company\u2019s ability to finance future capital needs and engage in other business activities.\nThe covenants in the company\u2019s existing credit agreement contain a number of significant limitations on its ability to, among other things:\n\u2022pay dividends;\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022create liens on the company\u2019s assets;\n\u2022engage in new lines of business;\n\u2022make investments;\n\u2022make capital expenditures and enter into leases; and\n\u2022acquire or dispose of assets.\nThese restrictive covenants, among others, could negatively affect the company\u2019s ability to finance its future capital needs, engage in other business activities or withstand a future downturn in the company\u2019s business or the economy.\nUnder the company\u2019s current credit agreement, the company is required to maintain certain specified financial ratios and meet financial tests, including certain ratios of leverage and interest coverage. The company\u2019s ability to comply with these requirements may be affected by matters beyond its control, and, as a result, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to meet these ratios and tests. A breach of any of these covenants would prevent the company from being able to draw under the company's revolver and would result in a default under the company\u2019s current credit agreement. In the event of a default under the company\u2019s current credit agreement, the lenders could terminate their commitments and declare all amounts borrowed, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable. Borrowings under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions may also be accelerated and become due and payable at such time. The company may be unable to pay these debts in these circumstances.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect the company's financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes is triggered, holders of the Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert their Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, unless the company elects to satisfy the conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of its common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), the company would be required to settle any converted principal through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect the company's liquidity. To the extent the company satisfies the conversion obligation by delivering shares of common stock, the company would be required to deliver a significant number of shares, which would cause dilution to its existing stockholders. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Convertible Notes in such circumstances, the company could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction in net working capital.\nThe capped call transactions expose the company to counterparty risk and may affect the value of the company's common stock.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, the company entered into capped call transactions with certain financial institutions, referred to as the capped call counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce or offset the potential dilution upon conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments the company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. From time to time, the capped call counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to the company's common stock and/or purchasing or selling the company's common stock in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes. This activity could cause a decrease in the market price of the company's common stock.\nIn addition, the capped call counterparties are financial institutions, and the company is subject to the risk that one or more of the capped call counterparties may default or otherwise fail to perform, or may exercise certain rights to terminate, their obligations under the capped call transactions. The company's exposure to the credit risk of the capped call counterparties is not secured by any collateral. If a capped call counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, the company will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to the exposure at the time under such transaction. The company's exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the exposure will increase if the market price or the volatility of the company's common stock increases. In addition, upon a default or other failure to perform, or a termination of obligations, by a capped call counterparty, the company may suffer more dilution than currently anticipated with respect to the company's common stock. The company can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the capped call counterparties.\nFluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect the company's results of operations and financial position.\nThe company's profitability may be adversely affected during any periods of unexpected or rapid increases in interest rates. The company maintains a revolving credit facility, which, at January 2, 2021, bore interest at 2.00% above LIBOR per annum. A significant increase in any of the forgoing rates would significantly increase the company's cost of borrowings, reduce the availability and increase the cost of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness and/or negatively impact the market price of the company's common stock. For additional detail related to this risk, see Part II, Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.\"\nThe company has a significant amount of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles could suffer losses due to asset impairment charges.\nThe company\u2019s balance sheet includes a significant amount of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, which represent approximately 37% and 20%, respectively, of its total assets as of January 2, 2021. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired, including identifiable intangible assets, and liabilities assumed in conjunction with acquisitions is recorded as goodwill. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 350 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, the company\u2019s long-lived assets (including goodwill and other intangibles) are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. In assessing the recoverability of long-lived assets, the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Various uncertainties, including continued adverse conditions in the capital markets or changes in general economic conditions, could impact the future operating performance at one or more of the company\u2019s businesses, which could significantly affect the company\u2019s valuations and could result in additional future impairments. Also, estimates of future cash flows are judgments based on the company\u2019s experience and knowledge of operations. These estimates could be significantly impacted by many factors, including changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends. If the company\u2019s estimates or the underlying assumptions change in the future, the company may be required to record impairment charges that, if incurred, could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s reported net earnings.\nThe company's defined benefit pension plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely affect the company's results of operations and cash flows.\nThe performance of the financial markets and interest rates impact our defined benefit pension plan expenses and funding obligations. Significant changes in market interest rates, decreases in fair value of plan assets, investment losses on plan assets, relevant legislative and regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding and changes in interest rates may increase the company's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows. In addition, upward pressure on the cost of providing healthcare coverage to current employees and retirees may increase the company's future funding obligations and adversely affect its results of operations and cash flows.\nThe company faces intense competition in the commercial foodservice, food processing, and residential kitchen equipment industries and failure to successfully compete could impact the company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nThe company operates in highly competitive industries. In each of the company\u2019s three business segments, competition is based on a variety of factors including product features and design, brand recognition, reliability, durability, technology, energy efficiency, breadth of product offerings, price, customer relationships, delivery lead-times, serviceability and after-sale service. The company has numerous competitors in each business segment. Many of the company\u2019s competitors are substantially larger and enjoy substantially greater financial, marketing, technological and personnel resources. These factors may enable them to develop similar or superior products, to provide lower cost products and to carry out their business strategies more quickly and efficiently than the company can. In addition, some competitors focus on particular product lines or geographic regions or emphasize their local manufacturing presence or local market knowledge. Some competitors have different pricing structures and may be able to deliver their products at lower prices. Although the company believes that the performance and price characteristics of its products will provide competitive solutions for its customers\u2019 needs, there can be no assurance that the company\u2019s customers will continue to choose the company\u2019s products over products offered by its competitors.\nFurther, the markets for the company\u2019s products are characterized by changing technology and evolving industry standards. The company\u2019s ability to compete successfully will depend, in large part, on its ability to enhance and improve its existing products, to continue to bring innovative products to market in a timely fashion, to adapt the company\u2019s products to the needs and standards of its current and potential customers and to continue to improve operating efficiencies and lower manufacturing costs. Moreover, competitors may develop technologies or products that render the company\u2019s products obsolete or less marketable. If the company is unable to successfully compete in this highly competitive environment, the company\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results will be materially harmed.\nThe company is subject to risks associated with developing products and technologies, which could delay product introductions and result in significant expenditures.\nThe product, program and service needs of the company\u2019s customers change and evolve regularly, and the company invests substantial amounts in research and development efforts to pursue advancements in a wide range of technologies, products and services. Also, the company continually seeks to refine and improve upon the performance, utility and physical attributes of its existing products and to develop new products. As a result, the company\u2019s business is subject to risks associated with new product and technological development, including unanticipated technical or other problems, meeting development, production, certification and regulatory approval schedules, execution of internal and external performance plans, availability of supplier- and internally-produced parts and materials, performance of suppliers and subcontractors, hiring and training of qualified personnel, achieving cost and production efficiencies, identification of emerging technological trends in the company\u2019s target end-markets, validation of innovative technologies, the level of customer interest in new technologies and products, and customer acceptance of the company\u2019s products and products that incorporate technologies that the company develops. These factors involve significant risks and uncertainties. Also, any development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in the company\u2019s businesses, and these efforts may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or meet the needs of the company\u2019s customers as fully as competitive offerings. In addition, the markets for the company\u2019s products or products that incorporate the company\u2019s technologies may not develop or grow as the company anticipates. The company or its suppliers and subcontractors may encounter difficulties in developing and producing these new products and services, and may not realize the degree or timing of benefits initially anticipated. Due to the design complexity of the company's products, the company may in the future experience delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. Any delays could result in increased development costs or deflect resources from other projects. The occurrence of any of these risks could cause a substantial change in the design, delay in the development, or abandonment of new technologies and products. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the company will develop new technologies superior to the company\u2019s current technologies or successfully bring new products to market.\nAdditionally, there can be no assurance that new technologies or products, if developed, will meet the company\u2019s current price or performance objectives, be developed on a timely basis, or prove to be as effective as products based on other technologies. The inability to successfully complete the development of a product, or a determination by the company, for financial, technical or other reasons, not to complete development of a product, particularly in instances in which the company has made significant expenditures, could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s financial condition and operating results.\nThe company depends on key customers for a material portion of its revenues. As a result, changes in the purchasing patterns or loss of one or more key customers could adversely impact the company\u2019s operating results.\nMany of the company\u2019s key customers are large restaurant chains and major food processing companies. The demand for the company\u2019s equipment can vary from period to period depending on the company\u2019s customers\u2019 internal growth plans, construction, seasonality and other factors. In addition, an adverse change to the financial condition of key customers could cause such key customers to open fewer facilities and defer purchases of new equipment for existing operations or otherwise change the purchasing patterns of such key customers. Any of these conditions or the loss of key customers could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nPrice increases in some materials and disruptions in supply could affect the company\u2019s profitability.\nThe company uses large amounts of stainless steel, aluminized steel and other commodities in the manufacture of its products. A significant increase in the price of steel or any other commodity, due to tariffs or otherwise, would adversely affect the company\u2019s operating results. In addition, unanticipated delays in delivery of raw materials and component inventories by suppliers-including delays due to capacity constraints, labor disputes, impaired financial condition of suppliers, natural disasters, extreme weather patterns and climate change, pandemics or other events outside our control- may increase the company's production costs, cause delays in the shipment of products or impair the ability of the company to satisfy customer demand. An interruption in or the cessation of an important supply by any third party and the company\u2019s inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner, or at all, could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe company faces risks related to health epidemics and other widespread outbreaks of contagious disease, which could significantly disrupt its operations and impact its operating results.\nThe spread of COVID-19 and other contagious diseases, or other adverse public health developments, could have a material and adverse effect on our business operations. These could include disruptions or restrictions on our ability to travel, as well as temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers or customers. Any disruption of our suppliers or customers would likely impact our sales and operating results.\nThe company may be the subject of product liability claims or product recalls, and it may be unable to obtain or maintain insurance adequate to cover potential liabilities.\nProduct liability is a significant commercial risk to the company. The company\u2019s business exposes it to potential liability risks that arise from the manufacturing, marketing and selling of the company\u2019s products. In addition to direct expenditures for damages, settlement and defense costs, there is a possibility of adverse publicity as a result of product liability claims. Plaintiffs in some jurisdictions have received substantial damage awards against companies based upon claims for injuries allegedly caused by the use of their products. In addition, it may be necessary for the company to recall products that do not meet approved specifications, which could result in adverse publicity as well as costs connected to the recall and loss of revenue.\nThe company cannot be certain that a product liability claim or series of claims brought against it would not have an adverse effect on the company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. If any claim is brought against the company, regardless of the success or failure of the claim, there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities or the cost of a recall. The company currently maintains insurance programs consisting of self-insurance up to certain limits and excess insurance coverage for claims over established limits. There can be no assurance that the company's insurance programs will provide adequate protection against actual losses. In addition, the company is subject to the risk that one or more of its insurers may become insolvent or become unable to pay claims that may be made in the future.\nAn increase in warranty expenses could adversely affect the company\u2019s financial performance.\nThe company offers purchasers of its products warranties covering workmanship and materials typically for one year and, in certain circumstances, for periods of up to ten years, during which periods the company or an authorized service representative will make repairs and replace parts that have become defective in the course of normal use. The company estimates and records its future warranty costs based upon past experience. These warranty expenses may increase in the future and may exceed the company\u2019s warranty reserves, which, in turn, could adversely affect the company\u2019s financial performance.\nThe company\u2019s financial performance is subject to significant fluctuations.\nThe company\u2019s financial performance is subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 general economic conditions;\n\u2022the lengthy, unpredictable sales cycle for the commercial foodservice equipment, food processing equipment and residential kitchen equipment groups;\n\u2022 the gain or loss of significant customers;\n\u2022 unexpected delays in new product introductions;\n\u2022the level of market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of the company\u2019s products;\n\u2022 unexpected changes in the levels of the company\u2019s operating expenses; and\n\u2022 competitive product offerings and pricing actions.\nEach of these factors could result in a material and adverse change in the company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe company may be unable to manage its growth.\nThe company has recently experienced rapid growth in its business. Continued growth could place a strain on the company\u2019s management, operations and financial resources. There also will be additional demands on the company\u2019s sales, marketing and information systems and on the company\u2019s administrative infrastructure as it develops and offers additional products and enters new markets. The company cannot be certain that the company\u2019s operating and financial control systems, administrative infrastructure, outsourced and internal production capacity, facilities and personnel will be adequate to support the company\u2019s future operations or to effectively adapt to future growth. If the company cannot manage the company\u2019s growth effectively, the company\u2019s business may be harmed.\nStrategic and Organizational Risks\nThe company\u2019s acquisition, investment and alliance strategy involves risks. If the company is unable to effectively manage these risks, its business will be materially harmed.\nTo achieve the company\u2019s strategic objectives, the company has pursued and may continue to pursue strategic acquisitions of and investments in other companies, businesses or technologies. Acquisitions and investments entail numerous risks, including, among others:\n\u2022 difficulties in the assimilation of acquired businesses or technologies and the inability to fully realize some of the expected synergies or otherwise achieve anticipated revenues and profits;\n\u2022 inability to operate acquired businesses or utilize acquired technologies profitably;\n\u2022 the significant amount of management time and attention needed to identify, execute and integrate any acquired businesses;\n\u2022 potential assumption of unknown material liabilities;\n\u2022 failure to achieve financial or operating objectives;\n\u2022 unanticipated costs relating to acquisitions or to the integration of acquired businesses;\n\u2022 loss of customers, suppliers, or key employees; and\n\u2022 the impact on the company's internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nThe company may not be able to successfully integrate any operations, personnel, services or products that it has acquired or may acquire in the future.\nThe company may seek to expand or enhance some of its operations by forming joint ventures or alliances with various strategic partners throughout the world. Entering into joint ventures and alliances also entails risks, including difficulties in developing and expanding the businesses of newly formed joint ventures, exercising influence over the activities of joint ventures in which the company does not have a controlling interest and potential conflicts with the company\u2019s joint venture or alliance partners. The company cannot assure that any joint venture or alliance entered into or that may be entered into in the future will be successful.\nAn inability to identify or complete future acquisitions could adversely affect future growth.\nThe company intends to continue its growth strategy of identifying and acquiring businesses with complementary products and services by pursuing acquisitions that provide opportunities for profitable growth. While the company continues to evaluate potential acquisitions, it may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms, obtain regulatory approval for certain acquisitions, or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future. An inability to identify or complete future acquisitions could limit the company\u2019s growth.\nExpansion of the company\u2019s international operations involves special challenges that it may not be able to meet. The company\u2019s failure to meet these challenges could adversely affect its business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe company plans to continue to expand its international operations. The company faces certain risks inherent in doing business in international markets. These risks include:\n\u2022extensive regulations and oversight, tariffs, including with respect to certain products imported from China or exported to China, retaliatory tariffs by China and certain other countries in response to tariffs implemented by the United States, and other trade barriers;\n\u2022 withdrawal from or renegotiation of international trade agreements and other restrictions on trade between the United States and China, the European Union, Canada, Mexico and other countries;\n\u2022 effects of the United Kingdom's decision to exit the European Union and related potential disruption to trade;\n\u2022 uncertain impact on operations, suppliers and customers related to business disruptions and restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022 reduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022 potentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022 limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022 transportation delays and interruptions;\n\u2022 political, social, and economic instability and disruptions;\n\u2022 labor unrests;\n\u2022 potential for nationalization of enterprises; and\n\u2022 limitations on the company\u2019s ability to enforce legal rights and remedies.\nIn addition, the company is and will be required to comply with the laws and regulations of foreign governmental and regulatory authorities of each country in which the company conducts business.\nThere can be no assurance that the company will be able to succeed in marketing its products and services in international markets. The company may also experience difficulty in managing its international operations because of, among other things, competitive conditions overseas, management of foreign exchange risk, established domestic markets, and language and cultural differences. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the success of the company\u2019s international operations and, consequently, on the company\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe impact of future transactions on the company\u2019s common stock is uncertain.\nThe company periodically reviews potential transactions related to products or product rights and businesses complementary to the company\u2019s business. Such transactions could include mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, alliances or licensing agreements. In the future, the company may choose to enter into such transactions at any time. The impact of transactions on the market price of a company\u2019s stock is often uncertain and may include substantial fluctuations. Consequently, any announcement of any such transaction could have a material adverse effect upon the market price of the company\u2019s common stock. Moreover, depending upon the nature of any transaction, the company may experience a charge to earnings, which could be material and have an adverse impact upon the market price of the company\u2019s common stock.\nThe company\u2019s business could suffer in the event of a work stoppage by its unionized labor force.\nBecause the company has a significant number of workers whose employment is subject to collective bargaining agreements and labor union representation, the company is vulnerable to possible organized work stoppages and similar actions. Unionized employees accounted for approximately 6% of the company\u2019s workforce as of January 2, 2021. The company has union contracts with employees at its facilities in Windsor, California; Algona, Iowa; Elgin, Illinois; Easton, Pennsylvania and Lodi, Wisconsin that extend through December 2021, December 2022, July 2022, May 2023 and December 2021, respectively. The company also has a union workforce at its manufacturing facility in the Philippines under a contract that extends through June 2021. Approximately 1% of the company's workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire within one year. Any future strikes, employee slowdowns or similar actions by one or more unions, in connection with labor contract negotiations or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s ability to operate the company\u2019s business.\nThe company depends significantly on its key personnel.\nThe company depends significantly on the company\u2019s executive officers and certain other key personnel, whom could be difficult to replace. While the company has employment agreements with certain key executives, the company cannot be certain that it will succeed in retaining this personnel or their services under existing agreements. The incapacity, inability or unwillingness of certain of these people to perform their services may have a material adverse effect on the company. There is intense competition for qualified personnel within the company\u2019s industry, and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to attract, motivate and retain personnel with the skills and experience needed to successfully manage the company's business and operations.\nTechnology and Cybersecurity Risks\nThe company may not be able to adequately protect its intellectual property rights, which may materially harm its business.\nThe company relies primarily on trade secret, copyright, service mark, trademark and patent law and contractual protections to protect the company\u2019s proprietary technology and other proprietary rights. The company has filed numerous patent applications covering the company\u2019s proprietary technology. Notwithstanding the precautions the company takes to protect its intellectual property rights, it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use the company\u2019s proprietary technology without authorization or may otherwise infringe on the company\u2019s rights. In some cases, including with respect to a number of the company\u2019s most important products, there may be no effective legal recourse against duplication by competitors as the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents and future patents we may own, or, generally, prevent the marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights. Further, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. In the future, the company may have to rely on litigation to enforce its intellectual property rights, protect its trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Any such litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs to the company and diversions of the company\u2019s resources, either of which could adversely affect the company\u2019s business.\nAny infringement by the company of a third party's patent rights could result in litigation and adversely affect its ability to provide, or could increase the cost of providing, the company\u2019s products and services.\nPatents of third parties may have an important bearing on the company\u2019s ability to offer some of its products and services. The company\u2019s competitors, as well as other companies and individuals, may obtain patents related to the types of products and services the company offers or plans to offer. There can be no assurance that the company is or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by its products and services. In addition, some patent applications in the United States are confidential until a patent is issued and, therefore, the company cannot evaluate the extent to which its products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications. In general, if one or more of the company\u2019s products or services were to infringe patents held by others, the company may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services, to obtain licenses from the holders of the patents to develop and market the services, or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing on the patent claims. The company cannot assess the extent to which it may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others, whether such licenses would be available or, if available, whether it would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms. If the company is unable to obtain such licenses, it also may not be able to redesign the company\u2019s products or services to avoid infringement, which could materially adversely affect the company\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe company may be subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions, cybersecurity attacks and breaches in data security, which may materially adversely affect the company\u2019s operations, financial condition and operating results.\nThe company depends on information technology as an enabler to improve the effectiveness of its operations and to interface with its customers, as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency. Information technology system failures, including suppliers\u2019 or vendors\u2019 system failures, could disrupt the company\u2019s operations by causing transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, delays or cancellation of customer orders, the loss of customers, impediments to the manufacture or shipment of products, other business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to intellectual property through a security breach.\nThe company\u2019s information systems, or those of its third-party service providers, could also be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information or disrupting business processes. Such unauthorized access could disrupt the company\u2019s business, increase costs and/or result in the loss of assets. Cybersecurity attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption or destruction of data and other manipulation or improper use of systems or networks. These events could negatively impact the company\u2019s customers and/or reputation and lead to financial losses from remediation actions, loss of business, production downtimes, operational delays or potential liability, penalties, fines or other increases in expense, all of which may have a material adverse effect on the company\u2019s business. In addition, as security threats and cybersecurity and data privacy and protection laws and regulations, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personally identifiable information, continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, we may invest additional resources in the security of our systems. Any such increased level of investment could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Further, as governmental authorities around the world continue to consider legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, we may face substantial penalties if we fail to comply with regulations and laws regarding data protection.\nTax, Legal and Regulatory Risks\nThe company may be subject to litigation, tax, and other legal compliance risks.\nIn addition to product liability claims, the company is subject to a variety of litigation, tax, and other legal compliance risks. These risks include, among other things, possible liability relating to personal injuries, intellectual property rights, contract-related claims, taxes and compliance with U.S. and foreign export laws, competition laws, and laws governing improper business practices. The company or one of its business units could be charged with wrongdoing as a result of such matters. If convicted or found liable, the company could be subject to significant fines, penalties, repayments or other damages.\nThe company\u2019s reputation, ability to do business, and results of operations may be impaired by the improper conduct of any of its employees, agents, or business partners.\nWhile the company strives to maintain high standards, the company cannot provide assurance that its internal controls and compliance systems will always protect the company from acts committed by its employees, agents, or business partners that violate U.S. and/or foreign laws or fail to protect the company\u2019s confidential information, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering, and data privacy laws, as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media. Any such violations of law or improper actions could subject the company to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions, lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and related shareholder lawsuits, lead to increased costs of compliance and damage the company\u2019s reputation.\nThe company is subject to potential liability under environmental laws.\nThe company\u2019s operations are regulated by a number of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling, storage and disposal of these materials. Compliance with these environmental laws and regulations is a significant consideration for the company because it uses hazardous materials in its manufacturing processes. In addition, because the company is a generator of hazardous wastes, even if it fully complies with applicable environmental laws, it may be subject to financial exposure for costs associated with an investigation and remediation of sites at which it has arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes if these sites become contaminated. In the event of a violation of environmental laws, the company could be held liable for damages and for the costs of remedial actions. Environmental laws could also become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with any violation, which could negatively affect the company\u2019s operating results. There can be no assurance that identification of presently unidentified environmental conditions, more vigorous enforcement by regulatory authorities or other unanticipated events will not arise in the future resulting in additional environmental liabilities, compliance costs and penalties that could be material. Environmental laws and regulations are constantly evolving, and it is impossible to accurately predict the effect they may have upon the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of the company.\nWe are subject to risks associated with possible climate change legislation, regulation and international accords.\nGovernment mandates, standards or regulations intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or projected climate change impacts have resulted in, and are likely to continue resulting in, increased energy, manufacturing, transportation and raw material costs. Governmental requirements directed at regulating greenhouse gas emissions could cause us to incur expenses that we cannot recover or that will require us to increase the price of products we sell to the point that it impacts demand for those products.\nUnfavorable tax law changes and tax authority rulings may adversely affect financial results.\nThe company is subject to income taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. Domestic and international tax liabilities are based on the income and expenses in various tax jurisdictions. The amount of the company\u2019s income and other tax liability is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts recorded, future financial results may include unfavorable tax adjustments.\nThe trading price of the company's common stock has been volatile, and investors in the company's common stock may experience substantial losses.\nThe trading price of the company's common stock has been volatile and may become volatile again in the future. The trading price of the company's common stock could decline or fluctuate in response to a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022the company's failure to meet the performance estimates of securities analysts;\n\u2022changes in buy/sell recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022fluctuations in the company's operating results;\n\u2022substantial sales of the company's common stock;\n\u2022general stock market conditions; or\n\u2022other economic or external factors.", "PERMNO": 75470, "SIC": 3580, "TIC": "MIDD"}
