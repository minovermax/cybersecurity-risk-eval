Risk Factors\nOur business, operations, and financial position are subject to various risks. Before making an investment in our Class A common stock or other securities we may have outstanding from time to time, you should carefully consider the following risks, as well as the other information contained in this annual report. Any of the risks described below could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, and as a result, an investment in our Class A common stock or other securities we may have outstanding from time to time could decline, and you may lose part or all of the value of your investment. This section does not describe all risks that are or may become applicable to us, our industry, or our business, and it is intended only as a summary of certain material risk factors. Some statements in this annual report, including such statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. See the section entitled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d More detailed information concerning other risks or uncertainties we face, as well as the risk factors described below, is contained in other sections of this annual report.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe face intense competition, which could limit our ability to maintain or expand market share within our industry and harm our business and operating results.\nThe market for products and services in each of our operating segments is fragmented, intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly evolving technology and product standards, dynamic user needs and the frequent introduction of new products and services. We face intense competition from a number of companies, including the companies listed under \u201cItem 1 - Business - Competition.\u201d The primary competitors for our supply chain services segment are other large GPOs, including in certain cases GPOs owned by healthcare providers. Our specialty pharmacy competes both with large national pharmacies and smaller local specialty pharmacies. Our direct sourcing activities compete primarily with private label offerings and programs, product manufacturers and distributors. The competitors in our performance services segment range from smaller niche companies to large, well-financed and technologically-sophisticated entities, and includes information technology providers and consulting and outsourcing firms.\nWith respect to our products and services in both segments, we compete on the basis of several factors, including breadth, depth and quality of our product and service offerings, ability to deliver clinical, financial and operational performance improvement through the use of products and services, quality and reliability of services, ease of use and convenience, brand recognition and the ability to integrate services with existing technology. Some of our competitors are more established, benefit from greater name recognition, have larger member bases and have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources. Other of our competitors have proprietary technology that differentiates their product and service offerings from our offerings. As a result of these competitive advantages, our competitors and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly to market forces, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns for their brands, products and services and make more attractive offers to our members.\nWe also compete on the basis of price in both of our segments. We may be subject to pricing pressures as a result of, among other things, competition within the industry, consolidation of healthcare industry participants, practices of managed care organizations, changes in laws and regulations applicable to our business operations, government action affecting reimbursement and financial stress experienced by our members. If our pricing experiences significant downward pressure, our business will be less profitable and our results of operations will be adversely affected. In this competitive environment, we cannot be certain that we will be able to retain our current members or expand our member base. If we do not retain current members or expand our member base, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed. Moreover, we expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation in both the healthcare information technology and healthcare services industries. If one or more of our competitors or potential competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could also adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany healthcare industry participants are consolidating to create larger and more integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power. We expect regulatory and economic conditions to force additional consolidation in the healthcare industry in the future. As consolidation accelerates, the economies of scale of our members\u2019 organizations may grow. If a member experiences sizable growth following consolidation, it may determine that it no longer needs to rely on us and may reduce its demand for our products and services. Some of these large and growing healthcare systems may choose to contract directly with suppliers for certain supply categories, and some suppliers may seek to contract directly with the healthcare providers rather than with GPOs such as ours. In connection with any consolidation, certain of our members may also move their business to another GPO. In addition, as healthcare providers consolidate to create larger and more integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market\npower, these providers may try to use their market power to negotiate fee reductions for our products and services across both of our business segments. Finally, consolidation may also result in the acquisition or future development by our members of products and services that compete with our products and services. Any of these potential results of consolidation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience significant delays in recognizing revenue or increasing revenue if the sales cycle or implementation period with potential new members takes longer than anticipated.\nA key element of our strategy is to market the various products and services in our supply chain services and performance services segments directly to healthcare providers, such as health systems and acute care hospitals, and to increase the number of our products and services utilized by existing members. The evaluation process is often lengthy and involves significant technical evaluation and commitment of personnel by these organizations. Further, the evaluation process depends on a number of factors, many of which we may not be able to control, including potential new members\u2019 internal approval processes, budgetary constraints for technology spending, member concerns about implementing new procurement methods and strategies and other timing effects. In addition, the contract or software implementation process for new products or services can take six months or more and, accordingly, delay our anticipated financial benefits from sales of such products or services. If we experience an extended or delayed implementation cycle in connection with the sale of additional products and services to existing or new members, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMember participation in our GPO programs may be terminated with limited or no notice and without significant termination payments. If our members reduce activity levels or terminate or elect not to renew their contracts, our revenue and results of operations may decrease materially.\nIn connection with the Reorganization, we entered into new GPO participation agreements with all of our member owners existing immediately prior to the completion of the Reorganization. These GPO participation agreements are generally terminable at any time by either party, upon one year\u2019s prior written notice, in addition to being terminable for cause. Our success in retaining member participation in our GPO programs depends upon our reputation, strong relationships with such members and our ability to deliver consistent, reliable and high quality products and services. In addition, members may seek to reduce, cancel or elect not to renew their contracts due to factors that are beyond our control and are unrelated to our performance, including their business or financial condition, changes in their strategies or business plans or economic conditions in general. When contracts are reduced, canceled or not renewed for any reason, we lose the anticipated future revenue associated with such contracts and, consequently, our revenue and results of operations may decrease materially.\nThe markets for our non-GPO services and products may develop more slowly than we expect, which could adversely affect our revenue and our ability to maintain or increase our profitability.\nThe market for products and services in our non-GPO lines of business is narrowly based, and our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of existing and potential new members to increase their use of our SaaS informatics products. Many companies have invested substantial resources to integrate established enterprise software into their businesses and therefore may be reluctant or unwilling to switch to our products and services. Furthermore, some companies may have concerns regarding the risks associated with the security and reliability of the technology delivery model associated with these services. If companies do not perceive the benefits of our products and services, then the market for these products and services may not expand as much or develop as quickly as we expect, which would significantly adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur members are highly dependent on payments from third-party healthcare payers, including Medicare, Medicaid and other government-sponsored programs, and reductions or changes in third-party reimbursement could adversely affect these members and consequently our business.\nOur members derive a substantial portion of their revenue from third-party private and governmental payers, including Medicare, Medicaid and other government sponsored programs. Our sales and profitability depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage of and reimbursement for our products and services our members purchase or otherwise obtain through us is available to our members from governmental health programs, private health insurers, managed care plans and other third-party payers. These third-party payers are increasingly using their enhanced bargaining power to secure discounted reimbursement rates and may impose other requirements that adversely impact our members\u2019 ability to obtain adequate reimbursement for our products and services. If third-party payers do not approve our products and services for reimbursement or fail to reimburse for them adequately, our members may suffer adverse financial consequences which, in turn, may reduce the demand for and ability to purchase our products or services.\nIn addition, government actions could limit government spending generally for the Medicare and Medicaid programs, limit payments to healthcare providers and increase emphasis on competitive bidding programs that could have an adverse impact on our members and, in turn, on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on the administrative fees we receive from our GPO suppliers, and the failure to maintain contracts with these GPO suppliers could have a generally negative effect on our relationships with our members and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHistorically, we have derived a substantial amount of our revenue from the administrative fees that we receive from our GPO suppliers. We maintain contractual relationships with these suppliers which provide products and services to our members at reduced costs and which pay us administrative fees based on the dollars spent by our members for such products and services. Our contracts with these GPO suppliers generally may be terminated upon 90 days\u2019 notice. A termination of any relationship or agreement with a GPO supplier would result in the loss of administrative fees pursuant to our arrangement with that supplier, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we lose a relationship with a GPO supplier we may not be able to negotiate similar arrangements for our members with other suppliers on the same terms and conditions or at all, which could damage our reputation with our members and adversely impact our ability to maintain our member agreements or expand our membership base and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, CMS, which administers the Medicare and federal aspects of state Medicaid programs, has issued complex rules requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to calculate and report drug pricing for multiple purposes, including the limiting of reimbursement for certain drugs. These rules generally exclude from the pricing calculation administrative fees paid by drug manufacturers to GPOs to the extent that such fees meet CMS\u2019s \u201cbona fide service fee\u201d definition. There can be no assurance that CMS will continue to allow exclusion of GPO administrative fees from the pricing calculation, which could negatively affect the willingness of pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay administrative fees to us.\nIf we are unable to maintain our relationships with third-party providers or maintain or enter into new strategic alliances, we may be unable to grow our current base business.\nOur business strategy includes entering into and maintaining strategic alliances and affiliations with leading service providers and other GPOs. These companies may pursue relationships with our competitors, develop or acquire products and services that compete with our products and services, experience financial difficulties, be acquired by one of our competitors or other third party or exit the healthcare industry, any of which may adversely affect our relationship with them. In addition, in many cases, these companies may terminate their relationships with us for any reason with limited or no notice. If existing relationships with third-party providers or strategic alliances are adversely impacted or are terminated or we are unable to enter into relationships with leading healthcare service providers and other GPOs, we may be unable to maintain or increase our industry presence or effectively execute our business strategy.\nIf we are not able to timely offer new and innovative products and services, we may not remain competitive and our revenue and results of operations may suffer.\nOur success depends on providing products and services within our supply chain services and performance services segments that healthcare providers use to improve clinical, financial and operational performance. Information technology providers and other competitors are incorporating enhanced analytical tools and functionality and otherwise developing products and services that may become viewed as more efficient or appealing to our members. If we cannot adapt to rapidly evolving industry standards, technology and member needs, including changing regulations and provider reimbursement policies, we may be unable to anticipate changes in our current and potential new members\u2019 requirements that could make our existing technology, products or service offerings obsolete. We must continue to invest significant resources in research and development in order to enhance our existing products and services, maintain or improve our product category rankings and introduce new high quality products and services that members and potential new members will want. If our enhanced existing or new products and services are not responsive to the needs of our members or potential new members, are not appropriately timed with market opportunity or are not effectively brought to market we may lose existing members and be unable to obtain new members and our results of operations may suffer.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from our largest members, some of which are also GPOs that serve our members.\nOur top five members, all of which are participants in our group purchasing programs, comprised approximately 18% of our consolidated net revenues for the year ended June 30, 2016. Our largest member, GNYHA Purchasing Alliance, LLC and its member organizations, comprised approximately 9% of our consolidated net revenues for the same period. The sudden loss of any significant member or a number of smaller members that are participants in our group purchasing programs could materially and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, certain of our significant members are themselves GPOs with their own respective direct contracting relationships, including relationships with some of our other members. The sudden loss of any of these members\nmay also result in increased competition for our supply chain services segment and materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nAcquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution and other adverse consequences.\nOur business strategy includes growth through acquisitions of additional businesses and assets. Future acquisitions may not be completed on preferred terms, and acquired assets or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations. Any of these acquisitions will involve the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of businesses. Such risks include, among other things:\n\u2022\nfailing to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses in an efficient, timely manner;\n\u2022\nassuming potential liabilities of an acquired company, some of which may not become known until after the acquisition;\n\u2022\nan acquired company's lack of compliance with laws and governmental rules and regulations, and the related costs and expenses necessary to bring such entity into compliance;\n\u2022\nan acquired company's general information technology controls may not be sufficient to prevent unauthorized access or transactions, cyber-attacks or other data security breaches;\n\u2022\nmanaging the potential disruption to our ongoing business;\n\u2022\ndistracting management focus from our core businesses;\n\u2022\nencountering difficulties in identifying and acquiring products, technologies, or businesses that will help us execute our business strategy;\n\u2022\nentering new markets in which we have little to no experience;\n\u2022\nimpairing relationships with employees, members, and strategic partners;\n\u2022\nfailing to implement or remediate controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at acquired companies that prior to the acquisition lacked such controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022\nthe amortization of purchased intangible assets;\n\u2022\nincurring expenses associated with an impairment of all or a portion of goodwill and other intangible assets due to the failure of certain acquisitions to realize expected benefits; and\n\u2022\ndiluting the share value and voting power of existing stockholders.\nAnticipated benefits of our previous and future acquisitions may not materialize. Future acquisitions or dispositions of under-performing businesses could result in the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities or amortization expenses or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, any of which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, expenses associated with potential acquisitions, including, among others, due diligence costs, legal, accounting, technology and financial advisory fees, travel and internal resources utilization, can be significant. These expenses may be incurred regardless of whether any potential acquisition is completed. In instances where acquisitions are not ultimately completed, these expenses typically cannot be recovered or offset by the anticipated financial benefits of a successful acquisition. As we pursue our business strategy and evaluate opportunities, these expenses may adversely impact our results of operations and earnings per share.\nOur business and growth strategy also includes non-controlling investments in other businesses. In the event these investments do not perform as well as expected, we could experience the loss of some or all of the value of our investment which loss could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we conduct accounting, financial, legal and business due diligence prior to making investments, we cannot guarantee that we will discover all material issues that may affect a particular target business, or that factors outside the control of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. To the extent we invest in a financially underperforming or unstable company or an entity in its development stage that does not successfully mature, we may lose the value of our investment. Occasionally, current and future investments are, and will be, made on a non-controlling basis, in which case we have limited ability to influence the financial or business operations of the companies in which we invest. If our investment loses value, we may be required to write down or write off our investment, or recognize impairment or other charges that could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and our stock price. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have a material impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us and our business strategy and our Class A common stock.\nWe are subject to litigation from time to time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe participate in businesses that are subject to substantial litigation. We are from time to time involved in litigation, which may include claims relating to commercial, product liability, personal injury, employment, antitrust, intellectual property or other regulatory matters. Additionally, if current or future government regulations are interpreted or enforced in a manner adverse to us or our business, specifically those with respect to antitrust or healthcare laws, we may be subject to enforcement actions, penalties, damages and other material limitations on our business.\nFrom time to time, we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits brought by suppliers of medical products. Typically, these lawsuits have alleged the existence of a conspiracy among manufacturers of competing products and operators of GPOs, including us, to deny the plaintiff access to a market for its products. No assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to similar actions in the future or that such matters will be resolved in a manner satisfactory to us or which will not harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may become subject to additional litigation in the future. Some of these claims may result in significant defense costs or may compel us to pay significant fines, judgments or settlements, which, if uninsured, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, certain litigation matters could adversely impact our commercial reputation, which is critical for attracting and retaining suppliers and member participation in our GPO programs.\nWe rely on Internet infrastructure, bandwidth providers, data center providers and other third parties and our own systems for providing services to our users, and any failure or interruption in the services provided by these third parties or our own systems could expose us to litigation and negatively impact our relationships with users, adversely affecting our brand, our business and our financial performance.\nOur ability to deliver our performance services segment products is dependent on the development and maintenance of the infrastructure of the Internet and other telecommunications services by third parties. This includes maintenance of a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity and security for providing reliable Internet access and services and reliable telephone, facsimile and pager systems. We have experienced and expect that we will experience in the future interruptions and delays in these services and availability from time to time. We rely on internal systems as well as third-party suppliers, including bandwidth and telecommunications equipment providers, to provide our services. We are also currently in the process of migrating some of our data center operations to third-party data-hosting facilities. We do not maintain redundant systems or facilities for some of these services. In the event of a catastrophic event with respect to one or more of these systems or facilities, we may experience an extended period of system unavailability, which could negatively impact our relationship with users. To operate without interruption, both we and our service providers must guard against:\n\u2022\ndamage from fire, power loss, and other natural disasters;\n\u2022\ncommunications failures;\n\u2022\nsoftware and hardware errors, failures, and crashes;\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches and computer viruses and similar disruptive problems; and\n\u2022\nother potential interruptions.\nAny disruption in the network access, telecommunications or co-location services provided by our third-party providers or any failure of or by these third-party providers or our own systems to handle current or higher volume of use could significantly harm our business. We exercise limited control over these third-party suppliers, which increases our vulnerability to problems with services they provide. Any errors, failures, interruptions or delays experienced in connection with these third-party technologies and information services or our own systems could negatively impact our relationships with users and adversely affect our business and financial performance and could expose us to third-party liabilities, some of which may not be adequately insured.\nData loss or corruption due to failures or errors in our systems and service disruptions at our data centers may adversely affect our reputation and relationships with existing members, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause of the large amount of data that we collect and manage, it is possible that hardware failures or errors in our systems could result in data loss or corruption or cause the information that we collect to be incomplete or contain inaccuracies that our members regard as significant. Complex software such as ours may contain errors or failures that are not detected until after the software is introduced or updates and new versions are released. We continually introduce new software and updates and enhancements to our software. Despite testing by us, from time to time we have discovered defects or errors in our software, and such defects or errors may be discovered in the future. Any defects or errors could expose us to risk of liability to members and the government and could cause delays in the introduction of new products and services, result in increased costs and diversion\nof development resources, require design modifications, decrease market acceptance or member satisfaction with our products and services or cause harm to our reputation.\nFurthermore, our members might use our software together with products from other companies. As a result, when problems occur, it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem. Even when our software does not cause these problems, the existence of these errors might cause us to incur significant costs, divert the attention of our technical personnel from our product development efforts, impact our reputation and lead to significant member relations problems.\nMoreover, our internal data centers and service provider locations store and transmit critical member data that is essential to our business. While these locations are chosen for their stability, failover capabilities and system controls, we do not directly control the continued or uninterrupted availability of every location. In addition to the services we provide from our offices, we are currently in the process of migrating some of our data center operations to third-party data-hosting facilities. Data center facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, cyber-attacks and similar misconduct. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. These service interruption events could impair our ability to deliver services or deliverables or cause us to fail to achieve service levels required in agreements with our members, which could negatively affect our ability to retain existing members and attract new members.\nIf our security measures are breached or fail and unauthorized access to a member\u2019s data is obtained, or our members fail to obtain proper permission for the use and disclosure of information, our services may be perceived as not being secure, members may curtail or stop using our services and we may incur significant liabilities.\nOur services involve the web-based storage and transmission of members\u2019 proprietary information and protected health information of patients. From time to time we may detect vulnerabilities in our systems, which, even if not resulting in a security breach, may reduce member confidence and require substantial resources to address. If our security measures are breached or fail as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance, insufficiency, defective design or otherwise, someone may be able to obtain unauthorized access to member or patient data. As a result, our reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer and we could face damages for contract breach, penalties for violation of applicable laws or regulations and significant costs for remediation and efforts to prevent future occurrences.\nWe rely upon our members as users of our system for key activities to promote security of the system and the data within it. On occasion, our members have failed to perform these activities. Failure of members to perform these activities may result in claims against us that could expose us to significant expense and harm our reputation. In addition, our members may authorize or enable third parties to access their data or the data of their patients on our systems. Because we do not control such access, we cannot ensure the complete propriety of that access or integrity or security of such data in our systems. Any breach of our security could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we require our members to provide necessary notices and to obtain necessary permissions and waivers for use and disclosure of the information that we receive. If our members do not obtain necessary permissions and waivers, then our use and disclosure of information that we receive from them or on their behalf may be limited or prohibited by state or federal privacy laws or other laws. Any such failure to obtain proper permissions and waivers could impair our functions, processes and databases that reflect, contain or are based upon such data and may prevent use of such data. Moreover, we may be subject to claims or liability for use or disclosure of information by reason of our lack of a valid notice, permission or waiver. These claims or liabilities could subject us to unexpected costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could suffer a loss of revenue and increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm, and other serious negative consequences if we sustain cyber attacks or other data security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the dissemination of proprietary or confidential information about us or our members or other third parties.\nWe manage and store proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our operations. We may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use for these purposes. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our systems.\nThe costs to us to eliminate or address the foregoing security problems and security vulnerabilities before or after a cyber incident could be significant. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation\nof service and loss of existing or potential members. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unapproved use or disclosure of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our members or other third parties could expose us, our members or other affected third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation, governmental inquiry and potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. Furthermore, we are exposed to additional risks because we rely in certain capacities on third-party data management providers whose possible security problems and security vulnerabilities are beyond our control.\nAny restrictions on our use of, or ability to license, data or our failure to license data and integrate third-party technologies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend upon licenses from third parties, most of which are non-exclusive, for some of the technology and data used in our applications, and for some of the technology platforms upon which these applications are built and operate. We also obtain a portion of the data that we use from government entities and public records and from our members for specific member engagements. We cannot assure you that our licenses for information will allow us to use that information for all potential or contemplated applications and products. In addition, if our members revoke their consent for us to maintain, use, de-identify and share their data, our data assets could be degraded.\nIn the future, data providers could withdraw their data from us or restrict our usage due to competitive reasons or because of new legislation or judicial interpretations restricting use of the data currently used in our products and services. In addition, data providers could fail to adhere to our quality control standards in the future, causing us to incur additional expense to appropriately utilize the data. If a substantial number of data providers were to withdraw or restrict their data, or if they fail to adhere to our quality control standards, and if we are unable to identify and contract with suitable alternative data suppliers and integrate these data sources into our service offerings, our ability to provide products and services to our members would be materially and adversely impacted, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also integrate into our proprietary applications and use third-party software to maintain and enhance, among other things, content generation and delivery, and to support our technology infrastructure. Some of this software is proprietary and some is open source. Our use of third-party technologies exposes us to increased risks, including, but not limited to, risks associated with the integration of new technology into our solutions, the diversion of our resources from development of our own proprietary technology and our inability to generate revenue from licensed technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs. These technologies may not be available to us in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all and could be difficult to replace once integrated into our own proprietary applications. Our inability to obtain, maintain or comply with any of these licenses could delay development until equivalent technology can be identified, licensed and integrated, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMost of our third-party licenses are non-exclusive and our competitors may obtain the right to use any of the technology covered by these licenses to compete directly with us. Our use of third-party technologies exposes us to increased risks, including, but not limited to, risks associated with the integration of new technology into our solutions, the diversion of our resources from development of our own proprietary technology and our inability to generate revenue from licensed technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs. In addition, if our data suppliers choose to discontinue support of the licensed technology in the future, we might not be able to modify or adapt our own solutions.\nOur use of \u201copen source\u201d software could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and subject us to possible litigation.\nThe products or technologies acquired, licensed or developed by us may incorporate so-called \u201copen source\u201d software, and we may incorporate open source software into other products in the future. There is little or no legal precedent governing the interpretation of many of the terms of certain of these licenses, and therefore the potential impact of these terms on our business is unknown and may result in unanticipated obligations or litigation regarding our products and technologies. For example, we may be subjected to certain conditions, including requirements that we offer our products that use particular open source software at no cost to the user, that we make available the source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon, incorporating or using the open source software, and/or that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. In addition, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, under some open source licenses we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software, which could substantially help our competitors develop products that are similar to or better than ours. If an author or other party that distributes such open source software were to allege that we had not complied with the conditions of one or more of these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal costs defending ourselves against such allegations and could be subject to significant damages.\nChanges in industry pricing benchmarks could materially impact our financial performance.\nContracts in the prescription drug industry, including our contracts with our specialty pharmacy members, generally use \u201caverage wholesale price,\u201d or AWP, which is published by a third party, as a benchmark to establish pricing for prescription drugs.\nVarious federal and state government agencies and prosecutors, as well as legislators and private litigants, have challenged the use of AWP for prescription drug reimbursement, as well as the manner by which AWP is calculated. Thus, some publishers have ceased providing AWP information, and the uncertainty related to continued AWP industry pricing benchmarks and the lack of reliable alternate pricing sources could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in future periods.\nPrescription volumes may decline, and our net revenues and profitability may be negatively impacted, if the safety risk profiles of drugs increase or if drugs are withdrawn from the market, including as a result of manufacturing issues, or if prescription drugs transition to over-the-counter products.\nWe dispense significant volumes of brand-name and generic drugs from our specialty pharmacies. When increased safety risk profiles or manufacturing issues of specific drugs or classes of drugs result in utilization decreases, physicians may cease writing or otherwise reduce the numbers of prescriptions for these drugs. Additionally, negative press regarding drugs with higher safety risk profiles may result in reduced global consumer demand for such drugs. On occasion, products are withdrawn by their manufacturers or transition to over-the-counter products. In cases where there are no acceptable prescription drug equivalents or alternatives for these prescription drugs, our volumes, net revenues, profitability and cash flows may decline.\nOur ability to grow our specialty pharmacy could be limited if we do not maintain and expand our existing base of drugs, if we lose patients or if manufacturers limit or cease doing business with us.\nOur specialty pharmacy focuses on complex and high-cost medications that serve a relatively small patient population. Accordingly, our future growth relies in part on maintaining and expanding our base of drugs or penetration in certain treatment categories. Sales volumes at our specialty pharmacy could also be negatively impacted due to increases in the safety risk profiles or manufacturing issues of specific drugs, product withdrawals by manufacturers or transitions to over-the-counter products. Any loss of patient base or reduction in demand for any reason for the medications we currently dispense could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, industry trends may result in health plans contracting with a single provider for specialty pharmacy services and manufacturers limiting their business with regional providers of these services. If we are unable to obtain managed care contracts in the areas in which we provide specialty pharmacy services or are unable to obtain specialty pharmacy products at reasonable costs or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur direct sourcing activities depend on contract manufacturing facilities located in various parts of the world, and any physical, financial, regulatory, environmental, labor or operational disruption or product quality issues could result in a reduction in sales volumes and the incurrence of substantial expenditures.\nAs part of our direct sourcing activities, we contract with manufacturing facilities in various parts of the world, including facilities in China. Operations at these manufacturing facilities could be curtailed or partially or completely shut down as the result of a number of circumstances, most of which are outside of our control, such as unscheduled maintenance, an earthquake, hurricane, flood, tsunami or other natural disaster or significant labor strikes, work stoppages or political unrest. Any significant curtailment of production at these facilities, or production issue resulting in a substandard product, could result in litigation or governmental inquiry or materially reduced revenues and cash flows in our direct sourcing activities. In addition our business practices in international markets are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, any violation of which could subject us to significant fines, criminal sanctions and other penalties. We expect all of our contracted manufacturing facilities, including facilities located in China, to comply with all applicable laws, including labor, safety and environmental laws, and to otherwise meet our standards of conduct. Our ability to find manufacturing facilities that uphold these standards is a challenge, especially with respect to facilities located outside the United States. We also are subject to the risk that one or more of these manufacturing facilities will engage in business practices in violation of our standards or applicable laws, which could damage our reputation and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nA substantial portion of the manufacturing for our direct sourcing activities is conducted in China. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects are affected significantly by economic, political and legal developments in China. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the degree of government involvement, the level of development, the growth rate, the control of foreign exchange, access to financing and the allocation of resources. Additionally, the facilities in China with which we contract are particularly susceptible to rising labor costs and interruptions as a result of minimum wage laws, scheduling and overtime requirements, labor disputes and strikes.\nIf we lose key personnel or if we are unable to attract, hire, integrate and retain key personnel, our business would be harmed.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to attract, hire, integrate and retain key personnel, including our executive officers and other highly skilled technical, managerial, editorial, sales, marketing and customer service professionals. Competition for such personnel is intense. We have from time to time in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience in the\nfuture, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. We cannot be certain of our ability to identify, hire and retain adequately qualified personnel. Failure to identify, hire and retain necessary key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property and claims against our use of the intellectual property of third parties could cause us to incur unanticipated expense and prevent us from providing our products and services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as customary contractual and confidentiality protections and internal policies applicable to employees, contractors, members and business partners. These protections may not be adequate, however, and we cannot assure you that they will prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. In addition, parties that gain access to our intellectual property might fail to comply with the terms of our agreements and policies and we may not be able to enforce our rights adequately against these parties. The disclosure to, or independent development by, a competitor of any trade secret, know-how or other technology not protected by a patent could materially and adversely affect any competitive advantage we may have over such competitor. The process of enforcing our intellectual property rights through legal proceedings would likely be burdensome and expensive and our ultimate success cannot be assured. Our failure to adequately protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we could be subject to claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other intellectual property violations as our applications\u2019 functionalities overlap with competitive products, and third parties may claim that we do not own or have rights to use all intellectual property used in the conduct of our business. We could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources defending any such claims. Furthermore, a party making a claim against us could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages as well as injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide products or services. Such claims also might require indemnification of our members at significant expense.\nA number of our contracts with our members contain indemnity provisions whereby we indemnify them against certain losses that may arise from third-party claims that are brought in connection with the use of our products.\nOur exposure to risks associated with the protection and use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we have limited visibility into the development process of acquired entities or businesses with respect to their technology or the care taken by acquired entities or businesses to safeguard against infringement risks. In addition, third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition thereof.\nIf we are required to collect sales and use taxes on the products and services we sell in certain jurisdictions or online, we may be subject to tax liability for past sales, future sales may decrease and our financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.\nSales tax is currently not imposed on the administrative fees we collect in connection with our GPO programs. If sales tax were imposed in the future on such fees, the profitability of our GPO programs may be materially and adversely affected.\nRules and regulations applicable to sales and use tax vary significantly by tax jurisdiction. In addition, the applicability of these rules given the nature of our products and services is subject to change.\nWe may lose sales or incur significant costs should various tax jurisdictions be successful in imposing sales and use taxes on a broader range of products and services than those currently so taxed, including products and services sold online. A successful assertion by one or more taxing authorities that we should collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our solutions could result in substantial tax liabilities for past and future sales, decrease our ability to compete and otherwise harm our business.\nIf one or more taxing authorities determines that taxes should have, but have not, been paid with respect to our products and services, including products and services sold online, we may be liable for past taxes in addition to taxes going forward. Liability for past taxes may also include very substantial interest and penalty charges. If we are required to collect and pay back taxes (and the associated interest and penalties) and if our members fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts, we will have incurred unplanned costs that may be substantial. Moreover, imposition of such taxes on our services going forward will effectively increase the cost of such services to our members and may adversely affect our ability to retain existing members or to gain new members in the areas in which such taxes are imposed.\nWe may need to obtain additional financing which may not be available or may be on unfavorable terms and result in dilution to, or a diminution of the rights of, our then-existing stockholders and cause a decrease in the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may need to raise additional funds in order to:\n\u2022\nfinance unanticipated working capital requirements;\n\u2022\ndevelop or enhance our technological infrastructure and our existing products and services;\n\u2022\nfund strategic relationships;\n\u2022\nrespond to competitive pressures; and\n\u2022\nacquire complementary businesses, assets, technologies, products or services.\nAdditional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our expansion strategy, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance technology or services or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, our then-existing stockholders may be diluted and holders of these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of our then-existing stockholders. The issuance of these securities may cause downward pressures on the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our business and our liquidity position.\nWe have a five-year $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which includes an accordion feature granting us the ability to increase the size of the facility by an additional $250 million on terms and conditions mutually acceptable to the parties. As of June 30, 2016, we had no amounts outstanding under this credit facility.\nOur indebtedness may increase from time to time in the future for various reasons, including fluctuations in operating results, capital expenditures and potential acquisitions. Any indebtedness we incur and restrictive covenants contained in the agreements related thereto could:\n\u2022\nmake it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations, including making interest payments on our debt obligations;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing to operate our business;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our debt, reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund capital expenditures and working capital and other general operational requirements;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility to execute our business strategy and plan for and react to changes in our business and the healthcare industry;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage relative to some of our competitors that have less debt than us;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to pursue acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates or a downturn in our business or the economy.\nThe occurrence of any one of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations or cause a significant decrease in our liquidity and impair our ability to pay amounts due on our indebtedness.\nOur unsecured revolving credit facility contains, among other things, restrictive covenants that will limit our and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other business activities. The credit facility restricts, among other things, our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness or issue guarantees, create liens on our assets, make distributions on or redeem equity interests, make investments, transfer or sell properties or other assets, and engage in mergers, consolidations or acquisitions. Furthermore, the credit facility includes cross-default provisions and requires us to meet specified financial ratios and tests. In addition, any debt securities we may issue in the future may have similar or more restrictive financial or operational covenants that may limit our ability to execute our business strategies or operate our Company.\nOur quarterly revenues and results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future.\nFluctuations in our quarterly results of operations may be due to a number of factors, some of which are not within our control, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to offer new and innovative products and services;\n\u2022\nregulatory changes, including changes in healthcare laws;\n\u2022\nunforeseen legal expenses, including litigation and settlement costs;\n\u2022\nthe purchasing and budgeting cycles of our members;\n\u2022\nthe lengthy sales cycles for our products and services, which may cause significant delays in generating revenues or an inability to generate revenues;\n\u2022\npricing pressures with respect to our future sales;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of new product and service offerings by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022\nmember decisions regarding renewal or termination of their contracts, especially those involving our larger member relationships;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of costs related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of costs related to the development, adaptation, acquisition, or integration of acquired technologies or businesses;\n\u2022\nthe financial condition of our current and potential new members; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions and conditions specific to the healthcare industry.\nWe believe that our quarterly results of operations may vary significantly in the future and that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. You should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance. If our quarterly results of operations fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the price of the Class A common stock could decline substantially. In addition, any adverse impacts on the Class A common stock may harm the overall reputation of our organization, cause us to lose members and impact our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nRisks Related to Healthcare Regulation\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated. Any material changes in the political, economic or regulatory environment that affect the GPO business or the purchasing practices and operations of healthcare organizations, or that lead to consolidation in the healthcare industry, could reduce the funds available to providers to purchase our products and services or otherwise require us to modify our services.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations depend upon conditions affecting the healthcare industry generally and hospitals and health systems particularly, as well as our ability to increase the number of programs and services that we sell to our members. The healthcare industry is highly regulated by federal and state authorities and is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences. Factors such as changes in reimbursement policies for healthcare expenses, consolidation in the healthcare industry, regulation, litigation and general economic conditions affect the purchasing practices, operations and the financial health of healthcare organizations. In particular, changes in regulations affecting the healthcare industry, such as increased regulation of the purchase and sale of medical products, or restrictions on permissible discounts and other financial arrangements, could require us to make unplanned modifications of our products and services, result in delays or cancellations of orders or reduce funds and demand for our products and services.\nIn March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act is a sweeping measure designed to expand access to affordable health insurance, control healthcare spending and improve healthcare quality. In addition, many states have adopted or are considering changes in healthcare laws or policies in part due to state budgetary shortfalls. Regulations for implementing various provisions of the Affordable Care Act are being released on an ongoing basis, and we do not know what effect the federal Affordable Care Act or any state law proposals may have on our business. Further, disparate political views regarding the Affordable Care Act create uncertainty regarding the law\u2019s continued existence in its current form or an amended form or a total replacement. This uncertainty as to the law\u2019s future, or the amendment or replacement of the law in the future, could adversely affect our business.\nIf we fail to comply with complex federal and state laws governing financial relationships among healthcare providers and submission of false or fraudulent claims to government healthcare programs, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties or loss of eligibility to participate in government healthcare programs.\nAnti-Kickback Regulations\nWe are subject to federal and state laws and regulations designed to protect patients, government healthcare programs and private health plans from fraudulent and abusive activities. These laws include anti-kickback restrictions and laws prohibiting the submission of false or fraudulent claims. These laws are complex, and their application to our specific products, services and relationships may not be clear and may be applied to our business in ways that we do not anticipate. Federal and state regulatory and law enforcement authorities have over time increased enforcement activities with respect to Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse regulations and other reimbursement laws and rules. From time to time, we and others in the healthcare industry have received inquiries or requests to produce documents in connection with such activities. We could be required to expend significant time and resources to comply with these requests, and the attention of our management team could be diverted to these efforts.\nFurthermore, if we are found to be in violation of any federal or state fraud and abuse laws, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and we could be excluded from participating in federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The occurrence of any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial performance and financial condition.\nProvisions in Title XI of the Social Security Act, commonly referred to as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibit the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of remuneration, directly or indirectly, in return for the referral of patients or arranging for the referral of patients, or in return for the recommendation, arrangement, purchase, lease or order of items or services that are covered, in whole or in part, by a federal healthcare program such as Medicare or Medicaid. The definition of \u201cremuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value such as gifts, discounts, rebates, waiver of payments or providing anything at less than its fair market value. Many states have adopted similar prohibitions against kickbacks and other practices that are intended to influence the purchase, lease or ordering of healthcare items and services regardless of whether the item or service is covered under a governmental health program or private health plan. Although certain statutory and regulatory safe harbors exist, these safe harbors are narrow and often difficult to comply with. Congress has appropriated an increasing amount of funds in recent years to support enforcement activities aimed at reducing healthcare fraud and abuse. We cannot assure you that our arrangements will be protected by such safe harbors or that such increased enforcement activities will not directly or indirectly have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any determination by a state or federal agency that any of our activities, or those of our suppliers or members, violate any of these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, could require us to change or terminate some portions of our operations or business or could disqualify us from providing services to healthcare providers doing business with government programs and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2005, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, Office of Inspector General conducted an extensive audit of the business practices of three GPOs, including us, and published a report thereon. Subsequently, CMS provided specific guidance on the proper treatment on Medicare cost reports of revenue distributions received from GPOs, including us. Our members that report their costs to Medicare are required under the terms of the Premier Group Purchasing Policy to appropriately reflect all elements of value received in connection with the Reorganization and our IPO (including, without limitation, increases in the fair market value of equity held by such member owners, proceeds from the purchase of Class B common units from such member owners immediately following our IPO and as a result of subsequent exchanges, Premier LP cash distributions, administrative fee revenue share paid by Premier LP to our members based upon their owned, leased, managed and affiliated facilities\u2019 purchases through GPO supplier contracts and payments under the tax receivable agreements) on their cost reports. We are required to furnish applicable reports to such members setting forth the amount of such value, to assist their compliance with such cost reporting requirements. We cannot assure you, however, that the HHS Office of Inspector General or the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, would concur with such approach. Any determination by a state or federal agency that the provision of such forms of value violate any of these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, could require us to change or terminate some portions of our operations or business, or could disqualify us from providing services to healthcare providers doing business with government programs, and, thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the lead-up to our 2013 IPO, we received correspondence from a former GPO competitor expressing concern that the manner in which our IPO was explained to our current and prospective member owners could violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. We believe that our discussions with then-current and prospective member owners regarding our IPO were conducted in compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute and other applicable laws. However, enforcement authorities could question or disagree with our assessment. Although a process exists for requesting advisory opinions from the HHS Office of Inspector General regarding compliance of particular arrangements with the Anti-Kickback Statute, we have not sought such an opinion and do not believe that the issues raised in the competitor\u2019s correspondence are capable of being addressed in an advisory opinion because the content and specifics of each discussion would be at issue. Any determination by a state or federal agency that the manner in which the opportunity to participate in our IPO was presented to our member owners and prospective member owners, either in and of itself or when viewed in conjunction with the requirements for ownership in Premier LP and participation in our group purchasing program or the various forms of value received by our member owners in connection with or related to our IPO, violated any of these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, could require us to change or terminate some portions of our operations or business or could disqualify us from providing services to healthcare providers doing business with government programs and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe periodically receive and respond to questions from government agencies on various matters, and we responded to an informal request in July 2014 from the HHS Office of Inspector General to analyze our Reorganization and to discuss how the GPO Participation Agreements comply with the discount safe harbor to the Anti-Kickback Statute. We have had no further correspondence or interaction, oral or written, with the HHS Office of Inspector General regarding Anti-Kickback Statute compliance since that time. There is no safe harbor to the Anti-Kickback Statute that is applicable to the Reorganization in its entirety across all of the agreements, and no assurance can be given that the HHS Office of Inspector General or other regulators or enforcement authorities will agree with our assessment. Any determination by a state or federal agency that the terms of our Reorganization or our relationship with our members violate the Anti-Kickback Statute or any other federal or state laws could\nsubject us to civil or criminal penalties, could require us to change or terminate some portions of our operations or business or could disqualify us from providing services to healthcare providers doing business with government programs and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFalse Claims Regulations\nOur business is also subject to numerous federal and state laws that forbid the submission or \u201ccausing the submission\u201d of false or fraudulent information or the failure to disclose information in connection with the submission and payment of claims for reimbursement to Medicare, Medicaid, other federal healthcare programs or private health plans. In particular, the False Claims Act, or FCA, prohibits a person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval by an officer, employee or agent of the United States. In addition, the FCA prohibits a person from knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to such a claim. Violations of the FCA may result in treble damages, significant monetary penalties and other collateral consequences, potentially including exclusion from participation in federally funded healthcare programs. The scope and implications of the amendments to the FCA pursuant to the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, or FERA, have yet to be fully determined or adjudicated, and as a result it is difficult to predict how future enforcement initiatives may impact our business. The minimum and maximum per claim monetary damages have roughly doubled effective August 1, 2016 for violations occurring on or after November 2, 2015, from $5,500.00 to $11,000.00 per claim to $10,781.40 to $21,562.80 per claim, and will be periodically readjusted for inflation hereafter. If enforcement authorities find that we have violated the FCA, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Pursuant to the 2010 healthcare reform legislation, a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA.\nThese laws and regulations may change rapidly and it is frequently unclear how they apply to our business. Errors in claims submitted by our specialty pharmacies and pharmacy benefits management businesses, as well as errors created by our products or advisory services that relate to entry, formatting, preparation or transmission of claim or cost report information by our members may be determined or alleged to be in violation of these laws and regulations. Any failure of our businesses or our products or services to comply with these laws and regulations, or the assertion that any of our relationships with suppliers or members violated the Anti-Kickback Statute and therefore caused the submission of false or fraudulent claims, could (i) result in substantial civil or criminal liability, (ii) adversely affect demand for our services, (iii) invalidate all or portions of some of our member contracts, (iv) require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, (v) require us to refund portions of our services fees, (vi) cause us to be disqualified from serving members doing business with government payers, and (vii) have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf current or future antitrust laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced in a manner adverse to us or our business, we may be subject to enforcement actions, penalties and other material limitations on our business.\nWe are subject to federal and state laws and regulations designed to protect competition which, if enforced in a manner adverse to us or our business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Over the last decade or so, the group purchasing industry has been the subject of multiple reviews and inquiries by the U.S. Senate and its members with respect to antitrust laws. Additionally, the U.S. General Accounting Office, or GAO, has published several reports examining GPO pricing, contracting practices, activities and fees. We and several other operators of GPOs have responded to GAO inquiries in connection with the development of such reports. No assurance can be given regarding any further inquiries or actions arising or resulting from these examinations and reports, or any related impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCongress, the DOJ, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, the U.S. Senate or another state or federal entity could at any time open a new investigation of the group purchasing industry, or develop new rules, regulations or laws governing the industry, that could adversely impact our ability to negotiate pricing arrangements with suppliers, increase reporting and documentation requirements, or otherwise require us to modify our arrangements in a manner that adversely impacts our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may also face private or government lawsuits alleging violations arising from the concerns articulated by these governmental factors or alleging violations based solely on concerns of individual private parties.\nIf we are found to be in violation of the antitrust laws we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties or damages. The occurrence of any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nComplex federal and state privacy, security and breach notification laws may increase the costs of operation and expose us to civil and criminal government sanctions and third-party civil litigation.\nWe must comply with extensive federal and state requirements regarding the use, retention, security and re-disclosure of patient/beneficiary healthcare information. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and the regulations that have been issued under it, which we refer to collectively as HIPAA, contain substantial restrictions and complex\nrequirements with respect to the use and disclosure of certain individually identifiable health information, referred to as \u201cprotected health information.\u201d The HIPAA Privacy Rule prohibits a covered entity or a business associate (essentially, a third party engaged to assist a covered entity with enumerated operational and/or compliance functions) from using or disclosing protected health information unless the use or disclosure is validly authorized by the individual or is specifically required or permitted under the Privacy Rule and only if certain complex requirements are met. The HIPAA Security Rule establishes administrative, organization, physical and technical safeguards to protect the privacy, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information maintained or transmitted by covered entities and business associates. The HIPAA Breach Notification Rule requires that covered entities and business associates, under certain circumstances, notify patients/beneficiaries and HHS when there has been an improper use or disclosure of protected health information.\nOur specialty pharmacy, our self-funded health benefit plan, and our healthcare provider members (provided that these members engage in HIPAA-defined standard electronic transactions with health plans, which will be all or the vast majority) are directly regulated by HIPAA as \u201ccovered entities.\u201d From time to time, as part of our specialty pharmacy business, certain of our affiliates act as business associates of retail and other pharmacies in connection with co-branding initiatives. As such, we are subject to HIPAA and other risks discussed herein associated with being a business associate. Additionally, because most of our U.S. hospital members disclose protected health information to us so that we may use that information to provide certain data analytics, benchmarking, advisory or other operational and compliance services to these members, we are a \u201cbusiness associate\u201d of those members and are required to protect such health information under HIPAA. With the enactment of the HITECH Act, the privacy and security requirements of HIPAA were modified and expanded, including further restrictions on the disclosure of protected health information by business associates of covered entities in certain cases when the disclosure is part of a remunerated transaction, and modifying the HIPAA Breach Notification Rule, which has been in effect since September 2009, to create a rebuttable presumption that any improper use or disclosure of protected health information requires notice to affected patients/beneficiaries and HHS.\nAny failure or perceived failure of our products or services to meet HIPAA standards and related regulatory requirements could expose us to certain notification, penalty and/or enforcement risks, damage our reputation and adversely affect demand for our products and services and force us to expend significant capital, research and development and other resources to modify our products or services to address the privacy and security requirements of our members and HIPAA.\nIn addition to our obligations under HIPAA there are other federal laws that include specific privacy and security obligations, above and beyond HIPAA, for certain types of health information and impose additional sanctions and penalties. These rules are not preempted by HIPAA. Finally, most states have enacted patient and/or beneficiary confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical information, and many states have adopted or are considering adopting further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, data security breach notification requirements and special rules for so-called \u201csensitive\u201d health information, such as mental health, genetic testing results or HIV status. These state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we are required to comply with them as well.\nWe are unable to predict what changes to HIPAA or other federal or state laws or regulations might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or the associated costs of compliance. For example, the federal Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology, or ONCHIT, is coordinating the development of national standards for creating an interoperable health information technology infrastructure based on the widespread adoption of electronic health records in the healthcare sector. We are yet unable to predict what, if any, impact the creation of such standards and the further developments at ONCHIT will have on the necessary specifications, demand for our products and services or associated compliance costs.\nFailure to comply with any of the federal and state standards regarding patient privacy, identity theft prevention and detection and data security may subject us to penalties, including civil monetary penalties and, in some circumstances, criminal penalties. In addition, such failure may materially injure our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain members and attract new members and, accordingly, adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur specialty pharmacy operations are subject to governmental regulations, procedures and requirements; our noncompliance or a significant regulatory change could adversely affect our business, the results of our operations or our financial condition.\nIn addition to the other laws and regulations we face, our specialty pharmacy business is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations. Changes in these regulations may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement. The regulations to which our specialty pharmacy operations are subject include, but are not limited to, federal, state and local registration and regulation of pharmacies; supply chain security; dispensing and sale of controlled substances; applicable Medicare and Medicaid regulations, including the Medicare Part D program; HIPAA; regulations governing aspects of healthcare plan arrangements; regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to and the management and disposal of hazardous substances; regulations enforced by the U. S. Federal Trade Commission, the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Drug Enforcement Administration, as well as state boards of pharmacy and other state regulatory authorities, governing the sale, advertisement and promotion of products we\nsell; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws and federal and state laws governing the practice of the profession of pharmacy. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our business, including: (i) suspension or disgorgement of payments from government programs; (ii) loss of required government certifications; (iii) loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government reimbursement programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; (iv) loss of licenses; or (v) significant fines or monetary penalties.\nCertain risks are inherent in providing pharmacy services; our insurance may not be adequate to cover any claims against us.\nPharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products, such as with respect to improper filling or labeling of prescriptions, adequacy of warnings, unintentional distribution of counterfeit, defective, expired or contaminated drugs, product tampering or recalls, and changes to shipping regulations or costs. Errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals could lead to serious injury or death. In addition, federal and state laws that require our pharmacists to offer counseling, without additional charge, to their customers about medication, dosage, delivery systems, common side effects and other information the pharmacists deem significant can impact our business. Our pharmacists may also have a duty to warn customers regarding any potential negative effects of a prescription drug if the warning could reduce, negate or help manage these effects. Product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide. Should a product or other liability issue arise, the coverage limits under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us against claims. We also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future. Damage to our reputation in the event of a product liability or personal injury issue, material financial judgment against us, or a product recall could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Structure\nPremier, Inc. is a holding company with no material business operations of its own, and it depends on distributions from Premier LP to pay taxes, make payments under the tax receivable agreements and pay any cash dividends, if declared, on our Class A common stock.\nPremier, Inc. is a holding company with no material operations of its own, and it currently has no independent ability to generate revenue. Consequently, Premier, Inc.\u2019s ability to obtain operating funds currently depends upon distributions from Premier LP to Premier GP and then from Premier GP to Premier, Inc. In accordance with the LP Agreement, subject to applicable laws and regulations and the terms of Premier LP\u2019s financing agreements, Premier GP causes Premier LP to make quarterly distributions to Premier GP and to the holders of Class B common units to facilitate the payment of taxes, as may be required. Premier GP distributes any amounts it receives from Premier LP to Premier, Inc., and Premier, Inc. uses such amounts to (i) pay applicable taxes, (ii) meet its obligations under the tax receivable agreements and (iii) meet its obligations to the member owners under the Exchange Agreement if such member owners elect to exchange their Class B common units for shares of our Class A common stock and we elect to pay some or all of the consideration to such member owners in cash.\nIn addition, pursuant to the GPO participation agreements, Premier LP generally is contractually required to pay each member owner a 30% revenue share, and pay other designated revenue shares to some members, of all gross administrative fees collected by Premier LP based upon purchasing by such member owner\u2019s owned, leased, managed and affiliated facilities through our GPO agreements and contracts. Additionally, our two largest regional GPO member owners, which represented approximately 16% of our gross administrative fee revenue for the year ended June 30, 2016, each remit gross administrative fees collected by such member owner based upon purchasing by such member owner\u2019s owned, leased, managed and affiliated facilities through the member owner\u2019s own GPO supplier contracts, in accordance with their Premier GPO Agreement, and receive revenue share from Premier LP equal to 30% of such gross administrative fees remitted to us.\nTo the extent that Premier, Inc. needs funds and Premier LP is restricted from making distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of our unsecured revolving credit facility or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, Premier, Inc.\u2019s liquidity and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. The declaration and payment of future dividends by us, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, financial results and cash flows from Premier LP\u2019s operations, our strategic plans and such other factors as our board of directors considers relevant. In addition, Premier LP is generally prohibited under Delaware law from making a distribution to a partner to the extent that, at the time of the distribution, after giving effect to the distribution, liabilities of the limited partnership (with certain exceptions) exceed the fair value of its assets.\nDifferent interests among our member owners or between our member owners and us, including with respect to related party transactions, could prevent us from achieving our business goals.\nFor the foreseeable future, we expect that a majority of our board of directors will include directors and executive officers of our member owners and other directors who may have commercial relationships with our member owners. Certain of our member owners could have business interests that may conflict with those of the other member owners, which may make it difficult for us to pursue strategic initiatives that require consensus among our member owners.\nIn addition, our relationship with our member owners, who are both our members and own a significant percentage of our common stock and the units of Premier LP, could create conflicts of interest among the member owners, or between the member owners and us, in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships. For example, certain of our products and services compete (or may compete in the future) with various products and services of our member owners. In addition, conflicts of interest may arise among the member owners based on certain allocations of net profits that the member owners may receive in proportion to their relative participation in our products and services. Except as set forth in the tax receivable agreements, the GPO participation agreements and the LP Agreement, there are not any formal dispute resolution procedures in place to resolve conflicts between us and a member owner or between member owners. We may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts between us and a member owner and, even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were negotiating with an unaffiliated party.\nOur member owners are able to exercise significant control over us, including through the election of all of our directors.\nIn addition to board members that are employees of member owners, our member owners beneficially own, in the aggregate, 100% of our outstanding shares of Class B common stock, giving them control of approximately 68% of the combined voting power of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock as of June 30, 2016. Our member owners may also own, from time to time, shares of our Class A common stock, thereby further increasing their aggregate voting power. Pursuant to the terms of a voting trust agreement (the \"Voting Trust Agreement\"), the trustee will vote all of the member owners\u2019 Class B common stock as a block in the manner determined by the plurality of the votes received by the trustee from the member owners for the election of directors to serve on our board of directors, and by a majority of the votes received by the trustee from the member owners for all other matters. As a result, our member owners have the ability to elect all of the members of our board of directors and thereby control our management and affairs. In addition, our member owners will be able to determine the outcome of substantially all matters requiring action by our stockholders, including amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, any proposed merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions even if such actions are not favored by our other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also prevent a change in the composition of our board of directors or a change in control of our company that could deprive other stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their Class A common stock as part of a sale of our company and might ultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, at June 30, 2016 our member owners owned 100% of our outstanding Class B common units, representing approximately 68% of the outstanding units of Premier LP. Because they hold their economic ownership interest in our business through Premier LP, rather than through Premier, Inc., due to the fact that shares of Class B common stock are not entitled to any economic rights, these member owners may have conflicting interests with holders of shares of our Class A common stock. For example, many of our member owners are not-for-profit organizations which, as a result of their tax-exempt status, could influence their decisions regarding whether and when to dispose of assets, whether and when to incur new, or refinance existing, indebtedness, and whether and when Premier should terminate the tax receivable agreements and accelerate its obligations thereunder. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may be influenced by these member owners\u2019 tax or other considerations even where no similar benefit would accrue to us.\nOur member owners are able to exercise a greater degree of influence in the operation of our business and that of Premier LP and the management of our affairs and those of Premier LP than is typically available to stockholders of a publicly-traded company. Even if our member owners own a minority economic interest in Premier LP, they may be able to continue to exert significant influence over us and Premier LP through their ownership of our Class B common stock and the Voting Trust Agreement among the member owners and the trustee of Premier Trust.\nWe are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements because we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of NASDAQ rules. As a result, our stockholders do not have the protections afforded by these corporate governance requirements, which may make our Class A common stock less attractive to investors.\nOur member owners, acting as a group pursuant to the terms of the Voting Trust Agreement, own more than 50% of the total voting power of our outstanding common stock and we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under NASDAQ corporate governance standards. As a controlled company, we are not required by NASDAQ for continued listing of Class A common stock to (i) have a majority of independent directors, (ii) maintain an independent compensation committee or (iii) maintain an independent nominating function. We are taking advantage of all of these exemptions from NASDAQ listing requirements. Accordingly, our\nstockholders do not have the same protection afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements and the ability of our independent directors to influence our business policies and affairs may be reduced. As a result, our status as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or could otherwise harm our Class A common stock price.\nThe agreements between us and our member owners were made in the context of an affiliated relationship and may contain different terms than comparable agreements with unaffiliated third parties.\nThe contractual agreements that we have with each of our member owners were negotiated in the context of an affiliated relationship in which representatives of our member owners and their affiliates comprised a significant portion of our board of directors. As a result, the financial and other terms of these agreements, including covenants and other contractual obligations on our part and on the part of our member owners and termination and default provisions, may be less favorable to us than terms that we might have obtained in negotiations with unaffiliated third parties in similar circumstances. These potentially different terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny payments made under the tax receivable agreements with our member owners will reduce the amount of overall cash flow that would otherwise be available to us. In addition, we may not be able to realize all or a portion of the tax benefits that are expected to result from the acquisition of Class B common units from the limited partners.\nAs a result of Premier, Inc.\u2019s acquisition of Class B common units of Premier LP from the member owners in connection with our IPO, and any subsequent exchanges of Class B common units with us for shares of Class A common stock, we expect to become entitled to special tax benefits attributable to tax basis adjustments involving amounts generally equal to the difference between our purchase price for the acquired Class B common units (or, in the case of an exchange, the value of the shares of Class A common stock issued by us) and our share of the historic tax basis in Premier LP\u2019s tangible and intangible assets that is attributable to the acquired Class B common units. Pursuant to an agreement with each of our member owners in connection with our IPO, we must pay to the member owners 85% of the amount, if any, by which our tax payments to various tax authorities are reduced as a result of these special tax benefits. We are also obligated to make certain other payments on the occurrence of certain events that would terminate the agreement with respect to certain member owners. The tax basis adjustments, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreements, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of any exchanges between us and the member owners, the amount and timing of our income and the amount and timing of the amortization and depreciation deductions and other tax benefits attributable to the tax basis adjustments.\nAs a result of the tax basis adjustments from our IPO and subsequent exchanges, presuming that Premier is able to timely realize the anticipated tax benefits, the future aggregate amount of payments to be made by the Company to the member owners is approximately $279.7 million as of June 30, 2016. Pursuant to the tax receivable agreements, payments are due to member owners to the extent that the Company recognizes the tax benefits attributable to the initial purchase of Class B common units from the member owners in the Reorganization and subsequent quarterly exchanges between the Company and its member owners. We expect Premier, Inc. to fund the required payments from distributions received from Premier LP.\nThe tax receivable agreements provide that, in the event we exercise our right to early termination or in the event of a change in control or a material breach by us of our obligations, the agreements will terminate and the Company will be required to make a lump-sum payment equal to the present value of all forecasted future payments that would have otherwise been made under the tax receivable agreements. These payments could be substantial and could exceed the actual tax benefits that we eventually receive as a result of acquiring Class B common units from the member owners. In the event that we do not have available capital on hand or access to adequate funds to make these payments, our financial condition would be materially adversely impacted.\nAdditionally, our ability to realize our 15% share of the total tax savings that we are entitled to retain under the tax receivable agreements depends on a number of assumptions. If our actual taxable income were insufficient or there were adverse changes in applicable law or regulations, we may be unable to realize all or a portion of these expected benefits and our cash flows and stockholders\u2019 equity could be negatively affected.\nChanges to Premier LP\u2019s allocation methods may increase a tax-exempt limited partner\u2019s risk that some allocated income is unrelated business taxable income.\nThe LP Agreement provides for the allocation of retained income to the limited partners of Premier LP, in part, according to the number of units owned rather than relative participation of the limited partners. A member owner that is a tax-exempt limited partner of Premier LP whose relative Class B common unit ownership is high compared to its relative participation may conclude, based on an analysis of its own facts and circumstances, that it has more unrelated business taxable income, or UBTI, subject to tax than it had reported in the past, or may be at increased risk that the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, will seek to increase the amount of income reported by the tax-exempt limited partner as UBTI. Further, the LP Agreement provides for the allocation of distributed income to be adjusted based on facts and circumstances as are determined appropriate by Premier GP. Such adjustments\nmay also increase the amount of income reported by certain tax-exempt limited partners as UBTI. Any increase in UBTI may cause a limited partner to leave Premier LP, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the LP Agreement and provisions of Delaware law may discourage or prevent strategic transactions, including a takeover of our company, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the LP Agreement and provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, could delay or prevent a third party from entering into a strategic transaction with us, even if such a transaction would benefit our stockholders. For example, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u2022\ndivide our board of directors into three classes with staggered three-year terms, which may delay or prevent a change of our management or a change in control;\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock in order to increase the aggregate number of outstanding shares of capital stock and thereby make a takeover more difficult and expensive;\n\u2022\ndo not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\ndo not permit stockholders to take action by written consent other than during the period following our IPO in which we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of NASDAQ rules;\n\u2022\nprovide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by or at the direction of the board of directors, the chair of our board or the chief executive officer;\n\u2022\nrequire advance notice to be given by stockholders of any stockholder proposals or director nominees;\n\u2022\nrequire a super-majority vote of the stockholders to amend our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022\nallow our board of directors to make, alter or repeal our bylaws but only allow stockholders to amend our bylaws upon the approval of 662/3% or more of the voting power of all of the outstanding shares of our capital stock entitled to vote.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL which limits, subject to certain exceptions, the right of a corporation to engage in a business combination with a holder of 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting securities, or certain affiliated persons.\nThe Exchange Agreement contains rights of first refusal in favor of the other member owners and Premier LP in the event that a member owner desires to exchange its Class B common units for shares of our Class A common stock, cash or a combination of both. In addition, the Tax Receivable Agreements contain a change of control provision which, if triggered, would require us to make a one-time cash payment to the member owners equal to the present value of the payments that are forecasted to be made under the Tax Receivable Agreements based on certain assumptions.\nThese restrictions and provisions could keep us from pursuing relationships with strategic partners and from raising additional capital, which could impede our ability to expand our business and strengthen our competitive position. These restrictions could also limit stockholder value by impeding a sale of Premier, Inc. or Premier LP and discouraging potential takeover attempts that might otherwise be financially beneficial to stockholders.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of integrated internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to conduct an annual review and evaluation of their internal controls and attestations of the effectiveness of internal controls by independent auditors. Maintaining effective internal controls has been and will continue to be costly and may divert management\u2019s attention.\nOur evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting may identify material weaknesses that may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and thereby result in adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions by the SEC or violations of NASDAQ listing rules. There also could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements also could suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. This could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and could also lead to a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.\nThe substantial number of shares of Class A common stock that will be eligible for sale or exchange by our member owners in the near future could cause the market price for our Class A common stock to decline or make it difficult for us to raise financing through the sale of equity securities in the future.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of Class A common stock or the availability of shares of Class A common stock for sale by our member owners will have on the market price of our Class A common stock from time to time. At June 30, 2016, we had 45,995,528 shares of our Class A common stock outstanding. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales will occur, could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline or make future offerings of our equity securities more difficult. If we are unable to sell equity securities at times and prices that we deem appropriate, we may be unable to fund our future growth.\nAt June 30, 2016, there were 96,132,723 Class B common units of Premier LP outstanding. In connection with the Reorganization and IPO, Premier, Inc., Premier LP and the member owners entered into an Exchange Agreement which became effective upon the completion of the Reorganization and IPO. Under this agreement, subject to certain restrictions, commencing on October 31, 2014, and during each year thereafter, each member owner has the cumulative right to exchange up to one-seventh of the Premier LP Class B common units initially allocated to such member owner (or subsequently purchased by such member owner pursuant to the related right of first refusal set forth in the Exchange Agreement), for shares of our Class A common stock, cash or a combination of both, the form of consideration to be at the discretion of the audit and compliance committee of our board of directors, subject to certain restrictions. Currently, we expect to settle these exchanges with our Class A common stock for the foreseeable future. This exchange right can generally be exercised on a quarterly basis (subject to rights of first refusal in favor of the other holders of Class B common units and Premier LP). In November 2014, we filed a registration statement with the SEC that registered under the Securities Act the resale of shares of Class A common stock received under the Exchange Agreement. On October 31, 2016, the third tranche of Class B common units, representing 15,441,618 units, will become eligible for exchange. Including Class B common units eligible for exchange as of the date of this Annual Report, a cumulative amount of 33,042,602 Class B common units are expected to be eligible for exchange on October 31, 2016.\nWe do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not expect to pay any dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. Payments of future dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors, including our business, operating results and financial condition, current and anticipated cash needs, plans for expansion and any legal or contractual limitations on our ability to pay dividends. As a result, capital appreciation in the price of our Class A common stock, if any, may be your only source of gain on an investment in our Class A common stock.\nOur future issuance of common stock, preferred stock, limited partnership units or debt securities could have a dilutive effect on our common stockholders and adversely affect the market value of our Class A common stock.\nIn the future, we could issue a significant number of shares of Class A common stock or Class B common stock, which could dilute our existing stockholders significantly and have a material adverse effect on the market price for the shares of our Class A common stock. Furthermore, the future issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may adversely affect the voting power of our common stockholders, either by diluting the voting power of our common stock if the preferred stock votes together with the common stock as a single class or by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the right to block an action on which they have a separate class vote even if the action were approved by the holders of our common stock. The future issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to the holders of preferred stock could adversely affect the market price for our Class A common stock by making an investment in the Class A common stock less attractive.\nMoreover, Premier LP may issue additional limited partnership units to third parties without the consent of Class A common stockholders, which would reduce Premier, Inc.\u2019s ownership percentage in Premier LP and would have a dilutive effect on the amount of distributions made to Premier, Inc. by Premier LP. Any newly admitted Premier LP limited partners will receive Class B common units in Premier LP and an equal amount of shares of our Class B common stock. Any such issuances could materially and adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition to potential equity issuances described above, we also may issue debt securities that would rank senior to shares of our Class A common stock.\nUpon our liquidation, holders of our preferred shares and debt securities and instruments will receive a distribution of our available assets before holders of shares of our Class A common stock. We are not required to offer any such additional debt or equity securities to existing stockholders on a preemptive basis. Therefore, additional issuances of our Class A common stock, directly or through convertible or exchangeable securities (including Class B common units), warrants or options, will dilute the holders of shares of our existing Class A common stock and such issuances, or the anticipation of such issuances, may reduce the\nmarket price of shares of our Class A common stock. Any preferred shares, if issued, would likely have a preference on distribution payments, periodically or upon liquidation, which could limit our ability to make distributions to holders of shares of our Class A common stock. Because our decision to issue debt or equity securities or otherwise incur debt in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future capital raising efforts.", "PERMNO": 14169, "SIC": 5122, "TIC": "PINC"}
