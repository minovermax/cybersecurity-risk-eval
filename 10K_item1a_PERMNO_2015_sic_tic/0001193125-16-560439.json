{"cik": "786110", "company": "GYMBOREE CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-04-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur financial performance is subject to various risks and uncertainties. The risks described below are those that we believe are the material risks we face. Any of the risk factors described below could significantly and adversely affect our business, prospects, sales, revenues, gross profit, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, these risk factors represent risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report. See \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Certain Other Obligations\nOur substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations.\nOn November 23, 2010 (the \u201cTransaction Date\u201d), The Gymboree Corporation completed a merger (the \u201cMerger\u201d) with Giraffe Acquisition Corporation (\u201cAcquisition Sub\u201d) in accordance with an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with Giraffe Holding, Inc. (\u201cParent\u201d), and Acquisition Sub, a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, with the Merger funded through a combination of debt and equity financing (collectively, the \u201cTransactions\u201d). The Company is continuing as the surviving corporation and a 100%-owned indirect subsidiary of the Parent. At the Transaction Date, investment funds sponsored by Bain Capital indirectly owned a controlling interest in Parent.\nAs a result of the Transactions discussed above, we are highly leveraged. The following chart shows our indebtedness as of January 30, 2016:\n(1) As of January 30, 2016, the Company\u2019s senior credit facilities (collectively, the \u201cSenior Credit Facilities\u201d) were comprised of an $820 million secured term loan agreement (\u201cTerm Loan\u201d) and a $225 million asset backed revolving credit facility (\u201cABL Revolving Facility\u201d). Amounts available under the ABL Revolving Facility are subject to customary borrowing base limitations and are reduced by letter of credit utilization. The Term Loan matures on February 23, 2018 and the ABL revolving commitments mature the earlier of (i) September 24, 2020 and (ii) the date that is 60 days before the scheduled final maturity date of any tranche of the Term Loan or the Notes (which mature in December 2018), unless such indebtedness is cumulatively equal to or less than $25.0 million in the aggregate and a reserve against the borrowing base is imposed equal to the amount of such indebtedness.\nThe Senior Credit Facilities also allow an aggregate of $200 million in uncommitted incremental facilities, the availability of which is subject to our meeting certain conditions.\nOur high degree of leverage could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates as the borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities will be at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged.\nDespite current indebtedness levels and restrictive covenants, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial financial leverage.\nThe terms of the indenture governing the Notes and the Senior Credit Facilities permit us to incur a substantial amount of additional debt, including secured debt. Any additional borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities, and any other secured debt, would be effectively senior to the Notes and any guarantees thereof to the extent of the value of the assets securing such secured debt. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the risks that we now face as a result of our leverage would intensify.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Notes contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants provide certain limits on, but do not prohibit, our ability to, among other things, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends on, or redeem or repurchase, our capital stock, make certain acquisitions or investments, enter into sale-leaseback transactions, materially change our business, incur or permit to exist certain liens, enter into transactions with affiliates or sell our assets to, or merge or consolidate with or into, another company. Further, our ability to comply with such covenants under the indenture governing the Notes may be affected by actions taken by the VIEs which we do not control, but the results of which we have consolidated into our financial statements and which are treated as restricted\nsubsidiaries under the indenture governing the Notes (see Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report). In addition to the foregoing covenants, under certain circumstances, the ABL Revolving Facility requires us to satisfy a financial test. Our ability to satisfy this test may be affected by events outside of our control.\nUpon the occurrence of an event of default under the Senior Credit Facilities, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged substantially all of our assets as collateral under the Senior Credit Facilities. If the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay the Senior Credit Facilities, as well as our other secured and unsecured indebtedness, including the Notes.\nWe require a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and fund our other liquidity needs, and our ability to generate sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make cash payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate significant operating cash flow in the future. This ability is, to a significant extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and future borrowings may not be available under our Senior Credit Facilities, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. In any such circumstance, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including the Senior Credit Facilities and the Notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments. Any such action, if necessary, may not be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Notes restrict our ability to sell assets and use the proceeds from such sales.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness (including covenants in our Senior Credit Facilities and the indenture governing the Notes), we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such a default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under our Senior Credit Facilities could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required lenders under our Senior Credit Facilities to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under our Senior Credit Facilities and seek such a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under our Senior Credit Facilities, the lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nRisks Related to the Business\nGlobal economic conditions may adversely affect our financial performance.\nDuring the recent economic recession, global financial markets experienced extreme volatility, disruption and credit contraction. The volatility and disruption to the capital markets significantly and adversely affected global economic conditions, resulting in additional significant recessionary pressures and declines in employment levels, consumer and business confidence, disposable income and actual and perceived wealth. Demand for children\u2019s apparel, specifically brand name apparel products, is impacted by the overall level of consumer spending. Although there have been some recent improvements, continuing or worsened adverse economic conditions, including higher unemployment, gasoline, energy and health care costs, taxes and tighter credit, could continue to affect consumer confidence and discretionary consumer spending adversely and may adversely affect our sales, cash flows and results of operations. Additionally, renewed turmoil in the financial and credit markets could adversely affect our costs of capital and the sources of liquidity available to us.\nFurther, we work with a large number of small vendors, some of whom have been or may be significantly impacted by any of the factors described above. If a number of these vendors fail, the delays and costs that we would likely incur in replacing them and in finding replacement goods and services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur results may be adversely affected by our failure to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer preferences in a timely manner.\nOur sales and profitability depend upon the continued demand by customers for our apparel and accessories. We believe that our success depends in large part upon our ability to anticipate, gauge and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demands and preferences and upon the appeal of our products. Further, current economic conditions and levels of discretionary spending also affect consumer preferences. We may not be able to anticipate, gauge and respond effectively to changes in consumer preferences, and, as a result, the demand for our apparel or accessories may decline. In addition, since much of our inventory is sourced from vendors located outside the United States, we usually must order merchandise and enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of such merchandise, up to nine months in advance of the applicable selling season and frequently before trends are known. A decline in demand for our apparel and accessories or a misjudgment could, among other things, lead to lower sales, excess inventories and higher markdowns, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nChanges in seasonal consumer spending patterns that are beyond our control could harm our business.\nHistorically, a significant portion of our retail sales have been realized during the holiday season in the months of November and December. We have also experienced periods of increased sales activity in the early spring, during the period leading up to the Easter holiday, and in the early fall, in connection with back-to-school sales. Changes in seasonal consumer spending patterns could result in lower-than-expected sales during these periods. Such circumstances could cause us to have excess inventory, necessitating markdowns to dispose of these excess inventories, which would reduce our profitability. Any failure by us to meet our business plan for, in particular, the third or fourth quarter of any fiscal year could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, which in all likelihood would not be offset by satisfactory results achieved in other quarters of the same fiscal year in which sales are less concentrated. Also, because we typically spend more in labor costs during the holiday season to hire temporary store employees in anticipation of increased holiday business volume, a shortfall in expected sales during that period could result in a disproportionate decrease in our earnings.\nIf we are unable to manage our inventory effectively, our gross margins could be adversely affected.\nWe normally order merchandise and enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of inventory, up to nine months in advance of the applicable selling season and frequently before trends are known. In addition, our business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory especially prior to the peak holiday selling season. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. If sales do not meet expectations, too much inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower than planned margins. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our merchandise, particularly higher volume styles, or if our manufacturers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages, which might result in lost sales, a negative impact on our customer relationships and/or diminished brand loyalty.\nOur business may be negatively impacted by consumer product safety laws, regulations or related legal actions.\nOur products are subject to consumer product safety laws, as well as regulations and standards with respect to product quality and safety set by various U.S., state and international government regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. New consumer product safety laws or changes to existing laws and regulations may make certain products unsalable or require us to incur significant compliance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings. Our inability, or that of our vendors or manufacturers, to comply on a timely basis with such laws and regulatory requirements could result in significant fines or penalties, which could adversely affect our reputation and earnings.\nAlthough we currently test products sold in our stores and at our Gymboree Play & Music sites, we have in the past recalled and may in the future need to recall products that we determine may present safety issues. Any such recall would be costly. If we or the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission recall a product sold in our stores, we could incur significant expense, experience negative publicity and be forced to defend product liability lawsuits, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position and earnings.\nIncreased production costs may adversely affect our results.\nWe are affected by inflation and changing prices primarily through purchasing products from our global suppliers, increased operating costs and expenses, fluctuations in interest rates, and fluctuating commodity prices. For example, when prices of raw materials such as cotton increase, the costs to produce many of our products also increase. In addition, increases in energy costs, which can be volatile, may also result in an increase in our transportation costs for distribution, utility costs for our stores, and costs to purchase our products from suppliers. If our customers are resistant to paying higher prices for our products, and if we are unable to absorb increased costs of goods by reducing our manufacturing or supply chain costs or lowering our overall cost structure, our profitability may be materially adversely affected.\nCompetition and the strength of our competitors may impair our ability to maintain or grow our sales and adversely affect our operating results.\nThe apparel segment of the specialty retail industry is highly competitive, and retailers are constantly adjusting their promotional activity and pricing strategies in response to changing conditions. E-commerce, including online flash sale sites and mobile applications, is rapidly evolving and, if we do not keep pace, our business, prospects and results of operations could be adversely affected. The principal factors of competition for retail sales are product design, product quality, brand image, customer service and pricing. Our Gymboree, Janie and Jack and Crazy 8 brands compete on a national level with Carter\u2019s, The Children\u2019s Place, BabyGap and GapKids (divisions of Gap Inc.), department stores operating in malls, outlet centers or street locations, discount retail chains such as Old Navy (a division of Gap Inc.), Wal-Mart and Target, as well as a wide variety of local and regional specialty stores, other retail chains, and children\u2019s retailers that sell their products by mail order, online or through outlet malls. Many of these competitors are larger than us and have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources. As a result, these competitors may be able to adapt to changes in customer preferences more quickly, take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily, devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and adopt more aggressive pricing strategies than we can. Increased competition may put deflationary pressure on our sales prices, reduce sales and gross margins, and increase operating expenses, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nBecause we purchase our products abroad, our business is subject to heightened risks associated with international business.\nOur products are currently manufactured to our specifications by independent factories located primarily in Asia. As a result, our business is subject to the risks generally associated with doing business abroad, currency fluctuations, adverse conditions such as epidemics, natural disasters, wars, acts of terrorism, social or political unrest, disruptions or delays in transportation or customs clearance, local business practices and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our suppliers are located. We cannot predict the effect of such factors on our business relationships with foreign suppliers or on our ability to deliver products into our stores in a timely manner. If even a small portion of our current foreign manufacturing sources or textile mills were disrupted or were to cease doing business with us for any reason, such actions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. If we experience significant increases in demand or need to replace an existing vendor, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any vendor would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements.\nIn addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our vendors in our methods, products, quality control standards, and environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. Moreover, in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of our products, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet consumer demand for our products and result in lower sales and net income or higher net loss. In addition, we are currently pursuing strategies to reduce product costs. These strategies may result in sourcing products from factories from which we have not previously purchased products and which may be in countries in which we have not done business before and may subject us to additional risk.\nFurthermore, our business is subject to risks associated with foreign governmental regulations, including without limitation exposure to potential liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, compliance with laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, privacy, network security, encryption, payments, restrictions on pricing or discounts and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions. Although we have implemented policies and procedures to facilitate our compliance with U.S. and foreign laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from various countries, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will be effective or that foreign vendors and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies. If our policies and procedures are not effective or if there is significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more vendors, U.S. and foreign governmental regulations could have a negative impact on our reputation, could subject us to liability and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nLabor disputes at ports can disrupt shipping and transportation channels, leading us to incur significantly higher freight costs and delay us getting products to market.\nThe majority of our products are manufactured outside of our principal sales markets. As a result, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographical distances. Shortages in ocean or air freight capacity and volatile fuel costs can result in rapidly changing transportation costs. We may not be able to pass all or any portion of these higher costs on to our customers or adjust our pricing structure in a timely manner in order to remain competitive, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Furthermore, shipping disruptions and delays could also negatively impact sales as each of our brands has significant elements that are seasonal in nature, especially the Gymboree brand, which is known for its mix and match colors and patterns and graphics.\nWe must timely and effectively deliver merchandise to our stores and customers.\nWe cannot control all of the various factors that might affect our fulfillment rates for online sales and timely and effective merchandise delivery to our stores. We rely upon third-party carriers for our merchandise shipments to and from stores and reliable data regarding the timing of those shipments. In addition, we are heavily dependent upon three carriers for the delivery of our merchandise to online customers. Labor disputes, union organizing activity, inclement weather, natural disasters and acts of terrorism could affect those carriers\u2019 ability to provide delivery services to meet our shipping needs. Failure to deliver merchandise in a timely and effective manner could damage our reputation and reduce sales.\nOur business may be harmed by additional U.S. regulation of foreign trade or delays caused by additional U.S. customs requirements.\nOur business is subject to the risk that the United States may adopt additional regulations relating to imported apparel products, including duties, taxes and other charges or restrictions on imported apparel. We cannot predict whether additional U.S. quotas, duties, taxes or other charges or restrictions will be imposed upon the importation of our products in the future, or what effect any such actions would have on our business, financial position and operating results. If the U.S. government imposes any such charges or restrictions, our supply of products could be disrupted and their cost could substantially increase, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Unforeseen delays in customs clearance of any goods could have a material adverse effect on our ability to deliver complete shipments to our stores in a timely manner, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nUnauthorized access to proprietary, confidential or personal information, including but not limited to through a compromise of our computer network security, could harm our reputation and business, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe collect, store and transmit proprietary and confidential information regarding our business and personal information regarding our customers, employees, job applicants, and others, including credit card information and personal identification information. Despite the steps that we and our vendors may have taken to mitigate risks associated with the collection, storage and transmission of such information, there can be no assurance that such information will be protected against unauthorized access, use or disclosure. As with many other companies, we may be subject to attempts to compromise our data security, and we, or a third party with which we share such information, could suffer a cyber attack. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, and the increasing sophistication of cyber thieves may increase the risk of such an attack being successful, in which case proprietary and confidential information regarding our business and/or personal information could be misappropriated, or system disruptions could occur. In addition, unauthorized disclosure of proprietary and confidential information regarding our business or of personal information could result from non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent disclosure by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships. A compromise of our computer network security, or of the network security of third parties with which we do business, or other unauthorized disclosure of the proprietary, confidential or personal information that we collect, store, or transmit, could disrupt our operations, result in significant response costs, damage our reputation, impact our ability to retain and attract customers, and expose us to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card brands, business partners, employees, and other persons, all of which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe are dependent on a single facility for distribution of our merchandise.\nWe handle merchandise distribution for all of our stores, including our online stores, from a single facility in Dixon, California. If we are not able to distribute merchandise to our stores or customers due to exceeding our capacity at the distribution facility (such as due to a high level of demand during peak periods), natural disasters, accidents, system failures, disruptions or other events, our sales could decline which may have a materially adverse effect on our earnings, financial position and our reputation. In addition, we use an automated unit sortation system to manage the order processing for our Crazy 8 and Janie and Jack direct-to-consumer businesses. In the event that this unit sortation system becomes inoperable for any reason, we would not be able to ship all direct-to-consumer orders in the timely manner that our customers expect. As a result, we could experience a reduction in our direct-to-consumer business, which could negatively impact sales and profitability.\nFor the last several years, we have fulfilled online customer orders for www.gymboree.com through a third-party fulfillment center in Ohio, which we operated through an outsourced arrangement. The arrangement provided us with warehousing, fulfillment and logistics services for these online orders. The arrangement requires us to rely on a third party for critical business functions. If this third party is unable to successfully operate the fulfillment center under this arrangement, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. On February 25, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to terminate the arrangement described above effective upon exiting from the fulfillment center in Ohio, which is expected to be in May 2016. The fulfillment of our www.gymboree.com online customer orders will continue to be processed at the third-party fulfillment center in Ohio through April 30, 2016. The Company expects to transfer the warehousing, logistics and fulfillment of our www.gymboree.com online customer orders to our distribution center in Dixon, California, in May 2016 and will pay an early\ntermination fee of $8.3 million to the third-party fulfillment center. Disruption or delays in the successful transition of the fulfillment of our www.gymboree.com online customer orders to our distribution center in Dixon, California, may have an adverse impact on sales and our reputation. Furthermore, this transfer increases the risk that capacity constraints, natural disasters, accidents, system failures, disruptions or other events experienced at the Dixon, California distribution facility could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, financial position and reputation.\nDamage to our computer systems could severely impair our ability to manage our business.\nOur operations depend on our ability to maintain and protect the computer systems we use to manage our purchase orders, store inventory levels, web applications, accounting functions and other critical aspects of our business. Our systems are vulnerable to damage from fire, floods, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. We have computer systems in each of our stores, with the main corporate and retail database servers for our systems located in San Francisco, California, our logistics system located in Dixon, California, and additional web site support systems located in Redwood City, California, which are located on or near known earthquake fault zones. An earthquake or other disaster could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results not only by damaging our stores or corporate headquarters, but also by damaging our main servers, which could disrupt our business for an indeterminate length of time. Our applications and systems are fully redundant, however our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient. In addition, we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses and expenses. Any of these events could damage our reputation, disrupt our business and be expensive to remedy.\nWe may be subject to negative publicity or legal action if our manufacturers violate labor laws or engage in practices that our customers believe are unethical.\nWe require our independent manufacturers to operate their businesses in compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to them. Our sourcing personnel periodically visit and monitor the operations of our independent manufacturers, but we cannot control their business or labor practices. We also rely on independent third parties to audit factories annually for compliance with safety and labor laws. If one of our independent manufacturers violates or is suspected of violating labor laws or other applicable regulations, or if such manufacturer engages in labor or other practices that diverge from those typically acceptable in the United States or any of the other countries in which we operate, we could in turn experience negative publicity or be subject to legal action. Negative publicity or legal actions regarding our manufacturers or the production of our products could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, sales, business, financial position and operating results.\nWe are dependent on third parties for operational and critical business functions, and their failure to provide services to us, or our inability to timely replace them when necessary, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe outsource certain operational functions such as customer service to third-party service providers. If we fail to deploy, manage, or oversee our operations successfully, our business could be adversely affected. We also rely on third parties for critical functions involving credit card processing and store communications. These third parties may experience financial difficulties or business disruptions that could adversely affect their ability to perform their contractual obligations to us, including their obligations to comply with Payment Card Industry (\u201cPCI\u201d) data security standards. Any such failure to provide services to us or to comply with PCI security requirements could negatively affect our reputation and impact our internal communications systems, including our ability to accept payment cards, which could have an adverse impact on business operations and lead to lower sales. Although we believe that other vendors could be identified and retained to provide these services, we may not find an adequate replacement timely, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and operating results and adverse publicity.\nOur online businesses face distinct operating risks.\nThe successful operation of our online businesses depends on efficient and uninterrupted operation of our order-taking and fulfillment operations. Disruptions or slowdowns in these areas could result from disruptions in telephone service or power outages, loss of internet connectivity, inadequate system capacity, system issues, computer viruses, human error, changes in programming, credit card fraud, natural disasters or adverse weather conditions. Our online businesses are generally vulnerable to additional risks and uncertainties associated with the Internet, including changes in required technology and other technical failures, as well as changes in applicable federal and state regulations, security breaches, and consumer privacy concerns. Problems in any of these areas, especially if such problems occur during the holiday season, could result in a reduction in sales, increased costs and damage to our reputation and brands.\nOur ability to successfully implement significant information technology systems is critical to our business.\nWe rely on our existing management information systems, including software programs, in operating and monitoring all major aspects of our business, including omnichannel, sales, distribution, purchasing, inventory control, merchandising planning and replenishment, as well as various financial systems.\nOur information technology infrastructure is in regular need of upgrades, which we plan to continue to implement. Such technology systems changes are complex and could cause disruptions that may adversely affect our business, such as when our new or upgraded systems fail to perform adequately. While we strive to ensure the orderly implementation of various information technology systems, we may not be able to successfully execute these changes without incurring a significant disruption to our business. Even if we are successful with implementation, we may not achieve the expected benefits from these initiatives, despite having expended significant capital. We may also determine that additional investment is required to bring our systems to their desired state, which could result in a significant investment of additional time and money and increased implementation risk. Furthermore, we intend to rely on third parties to fulfill contractual obligations related to some of these system upgrades. Failure of these third parties to fulfill their contractual obligations could lead to significant expenses or losses due to a disruption in business operations.\nFluctuations in comparative store sales and results of operations could cause our business performance to decline substantially.\nOur results of operations for our individual stores have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. Numerous factors affect our comparable store sales, including, among others, merchandise assortment, retail prices, fashion trends, weather conditions, mall traffic, the retail sales environment, calendar shifts of holidays or seasonal periods, timing of promotional events, macro-economic conditions, fuel costs and our success in executing our business strategies.\nOur ability to deliver strong comparable sales results and margins depends in large part on accurately forecasting demand and fashion trends, selecting effective marketing techniques, providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our customer base, managing inventory effectively, using effective pricing strategies, optimizing store performance, and retaining our store associates. Failure to meet the expectations of investors, securities analysts, or credit rating agencies in one or more future periods could cause our credit ratings to decline.\nWe may not be able to successfully operate if we lose key personnel, are unable to hire qualified additional personnel, or experience turnover of our management team.\nWe have recently had a number of changes to our executive management team. Our continued success is largely dependent on the individual efforts and abilities of our senior management team and certain other key personnel and on our ability to retain current management and to attract and retain qualified key personnel in the future. The loss of certain key employees or our inability to continue to attract and retain other qualified key employees could have a material adverse effect on our growth, operations and financial position.\nOur performance is dependent on attracting and retaining a large and growing number of qualified team members.\nMany of our team members are in entry-level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, minimum wage legislation, health care legislation and changing demographics. In addition, our labor costs are influenced by health care and workers\u2019 compensation costs, both of which have been rising in recent years. Legislative and private sector initiatives regarding healthcare reform could also result in significant changes to the U.S. healthcare system. Any increase in labor costs may adversely impact our profitability, or, if we fail to pay such higher wages, we could suffer increased employee turnover. Excessive store employee turnover could result in higher employee costs associated with finding, hiring and training new store employees. If we cannot hire enough qualified employees, or if there is a disruption in the supply of personnel we hire from third-party providers, especially during our peak season or certain high-volume events, our customer service levels and our operations could be negatively impacted.\nWe may experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate.\nWe are subject to income taxes in federal and applicable state and local tax jurisdictions in the United States, Canada, China, Australia, Puerto Rico, Kuwait, Hong Kong and South Korea. We record tax expense based on our estimates of future payments, which include reserves for estimates of uncertain tax positions. At any time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may impact the ultimate settlement of these tax positions. As a result, we expect that there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as taxable events occur and exposures are re-evaluated. Further, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings.\nWe are also subject to sales and use taxes, as well as other local taxes, in applicable jurisdictions in the United States, Canada, China, Puerto Rico and South Korea. At any time, many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may adversely impact the ultimate settlement of these tax positions and our financial results.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThere has been significant volatility in the value of the U.S. dollar against other foreign currencies in the recent past. While our business is primarily conducted in U.S. dollars, we purchase substantially all of our products overseas (primarily from China, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and India). Cost increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations could make our products less competitive or have an adverse effect on our profitability. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the third-party manufacturers that produce our apparel by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Such fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business and earnings.\nThe loss of our key buying agent or one or more of our suppliers could disrupt our ability to deliver our inventory supply in a timely fashion, impacting its value.\nOne buying agent manages a substantial portion of our inventory purchases (approximately 89% in fiscal year 2015). The loss of this buying agent could result in delays in procuring inventory, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. In addition, we have no long-term contracts with suppliers and typically transact business on an order-by-order basis, which provides us little pricing protection and could make it easier for a supplier to stop supplying us.\nWe are, and may continue to be in the future, a party to legal proceedings that could result in unexpected adverse outcomes.\nFrom time to time, we are a party to legal proceedings, including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, there are an increasing number of cases being filed in the retail industry generally that contain class action allegations, such as such those relating to privacy and wage and hour laws. We evaluate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish reserves for the estimated liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties. Although not currently anticipated by management, unexpected outcomes in these legal proceedings, or changes in management\u2019s evaluations or predictions and accompanying changes in established reserves, could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nOur growth could be hampered if we are unable to identify new store locations and relocate existing stores in appropriate retail venues and shopping areas.\nOur stores must be located in appropriate retail spaces in areas with demographic characteristics consistent with our customer base. These locations tend to be limited to malls and similar venues where the market for available space has historically been very competitive. The location of acceptable store sites and the negotiation of acceptable lease arrangements require considerable time, effort and expense. Our ability to lease desirable retail space for expansion and relocation of stores, and to renew our existing store leases, on favorable economic terms is essential to our revenue and earnings growth. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals, effectively manage our growth, successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations, or profitably operate our new and remodeled stores. Failure to obtain and renew leases for a sufficient number of stores on acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results.\nThe lease for our corporate offices is scheduled to expire in April 2018, and we may not be able to secure a new lease on commercially favorable terms.\nWe lease approximately 162,400 square feet of office space in San Francisco, California, for our corporate office space. Approximately 34,300 square feet of this office space is subleased to a third party. Our office lease and sublease agreements expire in April 2018. Due to the competitive commercial real estate market in the San Francisco Bay Area, we may not be able to negotiate a new lease for our existing corporate headquarters on commercially favorable terms. If we are unable to enter into a new lease at our existing location, our ability to lease a suitable alternative location on favorable terms will depend on many factors which are not within our control, such as conditions in the local real estate market and competition for desirable properties, and any relocation of our current corporate officers could be disruptive to our business operations and result in increased expenses.\nOur efforts to expand internationally through franchising and similar arrangements may not be successful and could impair the value of our brands.\nWe have entered into franchise agreements with unaffiliated third parties to operate stores in certain countries in the Middle East, South Korea and Latin America and with our affiliate (which we do not control or have an ownership interest in) to operate stores in China. Under these agreements, third parties operate stores that sell apparel, purchased from us, primarily under the Gymboree name. We have limited experience managing apparel retail franchise relationships and these arrangements may ultimately not be successful. While we expect that this will be a small part of our business in the near future, we plan to continue to increase these types of arrangements over time as part of our international expansion efforts. The effect of these arrangements on our business and operating results is uncertain and will depend upon various factors, including the demand for our products in new markets and our ability to successfully identify appropriate third parties to act as franchisees, distributors, or in a similar capacity. In addition, certain\naspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control. Other risks that may affect these third parties include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, and political instability. Moreover, while the agreements we have entered into and plan to enter into in the future provide us with certain termination rights, to the extent that these parties do not operate their stores in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our Gymboree brand identity and customer experience standards, or with laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection and privacy, the value of our brands could be impaired. A failure to protect the value of our brands or any other harmful acts or omissions by a franchisee could have an adverse effect on our operating results and our reputation.\nWe may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights.\nWe believe that our trademarks and service marks are important to our success and our competitive position due to their name recognition with our customers. We devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and service marks on a worldwide basis. We are not aware of any material claims of infringement or material challenges to our right to use any of our trademarks and service marks in the United States or abroad. Nevertheless, the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and service marks may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks, service marks and proprietary rights of others, particularly as we continue to expand our business outside the United States. Also, others may assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other proprietary rights of ours and we may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In addition, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.", "PERMNO": 78972, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "0160A"}
