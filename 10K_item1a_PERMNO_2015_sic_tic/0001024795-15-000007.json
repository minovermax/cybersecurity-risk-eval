{"cik": "1024795", "company": "SUN HYDRAULICS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. - RISK FACTORS\nFACTORS INFLUENCING FUTURE RESULTS - FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Annual Report contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts, and projections, our beliefs, and assumptions made by us, including (i) our strategies regarding growth, including our intention to develop new products; (ii) our financing plans; (iii) trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations; (iv) our ability to continue to control costs and to meet our liquidity and other financing needs; (v) the declaration and payment of dividends; and (vi) our ability to respond to changes in customer demand domestically and internationally, including as a result of standardization. In addition, we may make other written or oral statements, which constitute forward-looking statements, from time to time. Words such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cprojects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cseeks,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d variations of such words, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Similarly, statements that describe our future plans, objectives or goals also are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report. Our actual results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements, and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. All forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nFactors that could cause actual results to differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: (i) conditions in the capital markets, including the interest rate environment and the availability of capital; (ii) changes in the competitive marketplace that could affect our revenue and/or cost bases, such as increased competition, lack of qualified engineering, marketing, management or other personnel, and increased labor and raw materials costs; (iii) new product introductions, product sales mix and the geographic mix of sales nationally and internationally; and the following risk factors:\nSales in our industry are subject to economic cycles. The capital goods industry in general, and the hydraulics industry in particular, are subject to economic cycles, which directly affect customer orders, lead times and sales volume. Economic downturns generally have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, as they did in 2009. Cyclical economic expansions such as those of 2014, provide a context where demand for capital goods is stimulated, creating increased demand for the products we produce. In the future, continued weakening or improvement in the economy will directly affect orders and influence results of operations.\nWe are subject to intense competition. The hydraulic valve industry is intensely competitive, and competition comes from a large number of companies, some of which are full-line producers and others that are niche suppliers like us. Full-line producers have the ability to provide total hydraulic systems to customers, including components functionally similar to those manufactured by us. We believe that we compete based upon quality, reliability, price, value, speed of delivery and technological characteristics. Many screw-in cartridge valve competitors are owned by corporations that are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than we have. A new class of competitor has recently emerged in low cost production areas such as Asia and Eastern Europe with look-alike products. We cannot assure that we will continue to be able to compete effectively with these companies.\nMost of Sun\u2019s competitors either manufacture manifolds or have sources that they use on a regular basis. In addition, there are many independent manifold suppliers that produce manifolds incorporating various manufacturers\u2019 screw-in cartridge valves, including those made by us. Finally, there are many small, independent machine shops that produce manifolds at very competitive prices. We believe that competition in the manifold and integrated package business is based upon quality, price, performance, proximity to the customer and speed of delivery. Many competitors have very low overhead structures and we cannot assure that we will be able to continue to compete effectively with these companies.\nIn addition, we compete in the sale of hydraulic valves, manifolds and integrated packages with certain of our customers, who also may be competitors. Generally, these customers purchase cartridge valves from us to meet a specific need in a system that cannot be filled by any valve they make themselves. To the extent that we introduce new products in the future that increase competition with such customers, it may have an adverse effect on our relationships with them.\nWe are subject to risks relating to international sales. International sales represent a significant proportion of our consolidated sales. In 2014, approximately 57% of our net sales were outside of the United States. We will continue to expand the scope of operations outside the United States, both through direct investment and distribution, and expect that international sales will continue to account for a substantial portion of net sales in future periods. International sales are subject to various risks, including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs, longer payment cycles, difficulties in receivable collections, potentially adverse tax consequences, trade or currency restrictions, and, particularly in emerging economies, potential political and economic instability and regional conflicts.\nFurthermore, our international operations generate sales in a number of foreign currencies, particularly British pounds, the Euro, and the Korean Won. Therefore, our financial condition and results of operations can be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates between the United States dollar and these currencies. Any or all of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various risks relating to our growth strategy. In pursuing our growth strategy, we intend to expand our presence in existing markets and enter new markets. In addition, we may pursue acquisitions and joint ventures to complement our business. Many of the expenses arising from expansion efforts may have a negative effect on operating results until such time, if at all, that these expenses are offset by increased revenues. We cannot assure that we will be able to improve our market share or profitability, recover our expenditures, or successfully implement our growth strategy. See \u201cItem 1. - Business - Strategy.\u201d\nThe expansion strategy also may require substantial capital investment for the construction of new facilities and their effective operation. We may finance the acquisition of additional assets using cash from operations, bank or institutional borrowings, or through the issuance of debt or equity securities. We cannot assure that we will be able to obtain financing from bank or institutional sources or through the equity or debt markets or that, if available, such financing will be on acceptable terms.\nOur culture, by encouraging initiative, and both individual and collaborative responsibility, has substantially contributed to our success and operating results. Because our employees are able to readily shift their job functions to accommodate the demands of the business and changes in the market, we are a nimble, creative and innovative organization. As we increase the number of our employees and grow into new geographic markets, our culture will likely shift and evolve in new ways. Because our culture promotes the drivers of our success, our inability to protect and align our core values and culture with the evolving needs of the business could adversely affect our continued success.\nWe are dependent upon key employees and skilled personnel. Our success depends, to some extent, upon a number of key individuals. The loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. Future operating results depend to a significant degree upon the continued contribution of key management and technical personnel and the skilled labor force. As the Company continues to expand internationally, additional management and other key personnel will be needed. Competition for management and engineering personnel is intense and other employers may have greater financial and other resources to attract and retain these employees. We conduct a substantial part of our operations in Sarasota, Florida. Continued success is dependent on the Company\u2019s ability to attract and retain a skilled labor force at this location. There are no assurances that we will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel required to develop, manufacture and market our products and expand our operations. See \u201cItem 1. - Business - Employees.\u201d\nWe are subject to fluctuations in the prices of raw materials. The primary raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are aluminum, ductile iron and steel. We cannot assure that prices for such materials will not increase or, if they do, that we will be able to increase the prices for our products to maintain our profit margins. If future price increases do not adequately cover material cost increases, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent upon our parts suppliers. Our largest expense in cost of sales is the cost of purchasing cartridge valve parts. Our manufacturing costs and output could be materially and adversely affected by operational or financial difficulties experienced by, or cost increases from, one or more of our suppliers.\nWe are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems. We rely extensively on information technology systems to manage and operate our business. Our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if we experienced a significant business disruption due to the failure of these systems to function properly, or unauthorized access to our systems.\nHurricanes could cause a disruption in our operations which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. A significant portion of our operations are located in Florida, a region that is susceptible to hurricanes. Such weather events can cause disruption to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations. While we have property insurance to partially reimburse us for wind losses resulting from a named storm, such insurance would not cover all possible losses.\nWe are subject to risks relating to changes in our tax rates, unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be affected by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or changes in tax laws. We are subject to on-going tax audits in various jurisdictions. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts reserved, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe marketplace could adopt an industry standard cavity that would not accommodate our products. Our screw-in cartridge valves fit into a unique cavity for which, to date, few other manufacturers have designed products. Accordingly, our screw-in cartridge valves are not interchangeable with those of other manufacturers. Most competitive manufacturers produce screw-in cartridge valves that fit into an industry common cavity. There is an ongoing effort in the United States to produce a standard for screw-in hydraulic cartridge valve cavities based on the industry common cavity. Additionally, the International Standards Organization (\u201cISO\u201d) has an existing industry standard for screw-in hydraulic cartridge valve cavities, which is different from our cavity and the industry common cavity. In our view, the industry common cavity, as well as the suggested standardized form of this cavity, and the ISO standard cavity, fail to address critical functional requirements, which could result in performance and safety problems of significant magnitude for end users. To our knowledge, no major competitor has converted its standard product line to fit the ISO standard cavity. Any move by a substantial number of screw-in cartridge valve and manifold manufacturers toward the adoption of ISO standard or another standard, based on the existing industry common cavity, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. See \u201cItem 1. - Business - Competition.\u201d\nWe are subject to the cost of environmental compliance and the risk of failing to comply with environmental laws. Our operations involve the handling and use of substances that are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the soil, air and water and establish standards for their storage and disposal. We believe that our current operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, and have not suffered any material adverse effects due to compliance with environmental laws and regulations in the past. However, new laws and regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risk of liability for defective products. The application of many of our products entails an inherent risk of product liability. We cannot assure that we will not face any material product liability claims in the future or that the product liability insurance we maintain at such time will be adequate to cover such claims.\nWe may decide to reduce or eliminate dividends. Although we have paid a cash dividend each quarter since our common stock began publicly trading in 1997, we cannot assure that funds will be available for this purpose in the future. The declaration and payment of dividends is subject to the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our profitability, financial condition, capital needs, acquisition opportunities, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the board, and may be restricted by the terms of our credit facilities.\nCertain anti-takeover provisions may hinder or prevent a change in control. Our Articles of Incorporation provide for a classified board of directors. In addition, the Articles give the board of directors the authority, without further action by the shareholders, to issue and fix the rights and preferences of a new class, or classes, of preferred stock. These and other provisions of the Articles and our Bylaws may deter or delay changes in control, including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.\nWe are subject to control by certain shareholders and management. Christine L. Koski, the daughter of the deceased founder of the Company, Robert E. Koski, is a member of the board of directors. She, along with other family members, own or control approximately 14% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, the members of the Koski family have the ability to influence significantly the election of our directors and the outcome of certain corporate actions requiring\nshareholder approval, and to influence our business. Such influence could preclude any acquisition of the Company and could adversely affect the price of our common stock. Our directors and executive officers as a group beneficially own or control approximately 11% of the outstanding shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 84438, "SIC": 3490, "TIC": "HLIO"}
