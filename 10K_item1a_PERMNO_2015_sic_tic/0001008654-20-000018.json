{"cik": "1008654", "company": "TUPPERWARE BRANDS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThere are inherent risks and uncertainties associated with the Company that could adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations. Set forth below are descriptions of those risks and uncertainties that the Company currently believes to be material, but the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that could adversely affect the Company. Other events that the Company does not currently anticipate or that the Company currently deems immaterial also may affect its business, financial condition or results of operations. Before making an investment in the Company\u2019s securities, investors should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below, together with the other information in this Report, including the section entitled \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and the other reports and materials filed by the Company with the SEC.\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the Company\u2019s operations, including those operations performed for the Company by third parties. This would include but is not limited to the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees or others, errors relating to transaction processing, breaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements, and unplanned interruptions in service. Certain of these types of activities were identified in the course of the Company\u2019s review of the Fuller Mexico business.\nThe risk of operational loss also includes the potential legal or regulatory actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency, or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards. The Company must comply with a number of legal and regulatory requirements, including those under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended.\nThe Company maintains systems of internal controls that provide management with timely and accurate information about the Company\u2019s operations. These systems have been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate levels given the Company\u2019s financial strength, the environment in which it operates, and considering factors such as competition and regulation. The Company has also established procedures that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business practices are followed on a uniform basis. While there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer losses in the future due to operational errors that the Company discovers, management continually monitors and works to improve its internal controls, systems, and corporate-wide processes and procedures.\nIn February 2020, the Company, with the help of external legal and accounting resources, conducted an investigation into its Fuller Mexico business primarily regarding the accounting for accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The financial impact of this matter is discussed more fully in \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Segment Results - North America.\u201d. While the Company believes that it has resolved this matter, there can be no assurances that similar issues will not be identified in the future.\nSales Force Factors\nThe Company is largely dependent upon the independent sales organizations and individuals to reach end consumers, and any significant disruption of this distribution network would have a negative financial impact on the Company and its ability to generate sales, earnings and operating cash flows. The Company\u2019s distribution system depends upon successful addition, activation and retention of a large force of independent sales personnel. The addition, retention and activation of sales force members is dependent upon the competitive environment among other companies who also use this channel of distribution and upon the general labor market, unemployment levels, general economic conditions, demographic and cultural changes in the workforce and the level of penetration of the Company's sales force in the geographies in which it operates as well as the introduction of new products. The Company also competes for sales force members with other companies in various channels where an individual can move seamlessly from one opportunity to the next due to the relative low cost of entry, no requirement to attract, build and train new team members, and has use of sophisticated platforms that drive traffic, place orders, and delivers.\nThe Company\u2019s sales are directly tied to the activity levels of its sales force, which is in large part a temporary working activity for many sales force members. Activity levels may be affected by the degree to which a market is penetrated by the presence of the Company\u2019s sales force, the amount of average sales per order, the amount of sales per sales force member, the mix of high-margin and low-margin products sold at group demonstrations and elsewhere, and the activities and actions of the Company\u2019s product line and channel competitors. The Company\u2019s sales force members may be affected by initiatives undertaken by the Company to grow its revenue base or change its cost base which may lead to the inaccurate perception that the independent sales force system is at risk of being phased out or the Company intends to exit markets.\nConsumer Demand\nThe Company's business is subject to changes in consumer trends and demands such as the types of products the Company offers, the ease of finding and ordering the product, and the speed at which the products can be delivered. The Company's ability to accurately predict and respond to these changes could impact the Company's financial results. The Company currently has less than one percent of its revenue derived from channels other than direct selling. The reliance on this dominant channel in an environment where the consumer expects a frictionless experience could impact the Company's business.\nInternational Operations\nThe Company is subject to risks of doing business internationally. The Company has derived for a number of years, over 90 percent of its net sales from operations outside the United States. An economic slowdown in any of the countries where the Company operates, particularly in Brazil and China, could materially affect the Company's revenues and operating results. Although these operations are geographically dispersed, which partially mitigates the risks associated with operating in particular countries, the Company is subject to the usual risks associated with international operations. Among others, these risks include local political and economic environments, adverse new tax regulations, potentially burdensome privacy protocols, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation, and relations between the United States and foreign governments. In addition, some of the international jurisdictions in which the Company operates have a different, or less developed, legal system that lacks transparency in certain respects relative to that of the United States, and can accord local government authorities a higher degree of control and discretion over business than is customary in the United States.\nMovement in exchange rates has had and may continue to have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s earnings, cash flows and financial position. The Company\u2019s most significant exposures are to the Brazilian real, Chinese renminbi, Euro, Indonesian rupiah, Malaysian ringgit, Mexican peso and South African rand. In 2019 the Company generated at least $100 million of sales in Brazil, China, Fuller Mexico, Tupperware Mexico and the United States and Canada. Of these units, sales by Brazil and China exceeded $200 million. Although the Company's currency risk is partially mitigated by the natural hedge arising from its local product sourcing in many markets, a strengthening U.S. dollar generally has a negative impact on the Company. In response to this fact, the Company continues to implement foreign currency hedging and risk management strategies to reduce the exposure to fluctuations in earnings associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company generally does not seek to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations on the translated value of the sales, profit or cash flow generated by its operations. Some of the hedging strategies implemented have a positive or negative impact on cash flows as foreign currencies fluctuate versus the U.S. dollar. There can be no assurance that foreign currency fluctuations and related hedging activities will not have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition.\nAnother risk associated with the Company\u2019s international operations is restrictions foreign governments may impose on currency remittances. Due to the possibility of government restrictions on transfers of cash out of countries and control of exchange rates and currency convertibility, the Company may not be able to immediately access its cash at the exchange rate used to translate its financial statements. As of the end of 2019, this was a particular issue in China.\nSee Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion regarding this risk.\nLegal and Regulatory Issues\nThe Company's business may also be affected by actions of domestic and foreign governments to restrict the activities of direct selling companies for various reasons, including a limitation on the ability of direct selling companies to operate without the involvement of a traditional retail channel. Foreign governments may also introduce other forms of protectionist legislation, such as limitations or requirements on where the products can or must be produced or requirements that non-domestic companies doing or seeking to do business place a certain percentage of ownership of legal entities in the hands of local nationals to protect the commercial interests of its citizens. Customs laws, tariffs, import duties, export and import quotas and restrictions on repatriation of foreign earnings and/or other methods of accessing cash generated internationally, may negatively affect the Company's local or corporate operations. Governments may seek either to impose taxes on independent sales force members, to classify independent sales force members as employees of direct selling companies with whom they may be associated, triggering employment-related taxes on the Company's sales force and/or the direct selling companies, or to impose registration requirements that could impact prospects' willingness to join the sales force. Some governments prohibit or impose limitations on the requirement to purchase demonstration products upon joining a direct selling business and/or the types of activities for which sales force can be compensated. The U.S. government may impose restrictions on the Company's ability to engage in business in other countries in connection with the foreign policy of the United States.\nFinancial Covenants, Liquidity and Existing Debt\nThe Company must meet certain financial covenants as defined in the applicable agreements to borrow under its credit facilities. In the event the Company fails to comply with any of the covenants or to meet its payment obligations, it could lead to an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations. The Company may not have sufficient working capital or liquidity to satisfy its debt obligations in the event of an acceleration of all or a portion of its outstanding obligations. If the Company\u2019s cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund its debt service obligations, it may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance its indebtedness. The Company\u2019s ability to restructure or refinance its debt will depend on market conditions and the Company\u2019s financial performance at such time. Any refinancing, if at all, of the Company\u2019s debt could be at higher interest rates and may require the Company to comply with more covenants, which could further restrict its business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict the Company from adopting some of these alternatives.\nIn the third quarter of 2019, Standard and Poor\u2019s Financial Services, Inc. (\"S&P\") downgraded the Company\u2019s credit rating from BBB- to BB+. This downgrade did not have an impact on the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of March 29, 2019 (as so amended, the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d) due to the Credit Agreement defining a Non-Investment Grade Ratings Event, which at the time was the threshold for any additional guarantee and collateral requirements, as a Moody\u2019s rating of Ba2 or lower or an S&P rating of BB or lower. Additionally, there were no changes in the status level for the applicable margins as stated in the Credit Agreement Pricing Schedule 1.01, due to the Company\u2019s consolidated leverage ratio on the last day of the quarter being less than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00.\nOn February 26, 2020, S&P downgraded the Company\u2019s credit rating from BB+ to B and placed all of its ratings on CreditWatch with negative implication. On February 27, 2020 Moody\u2019s downgraded the Company\u2019s credit rating from Baa3 to B1. Although each downgrade exceeded the threshold for additional guarantee and collateral requirements of the Credit Agreement, at the time of the downgrade the Company had already received the approvals it required from its bank group for the amendment (the \u201cAmendment\u201d) of its Credit Agreement in order to provide relief regarding the financial covenant that requires the Company to maintain a specified ratio of (i) Consolidated Funded Indebtedness to (ii) Consolidated EBITDA (the \u201cConsolidated Leverage Ratio\u201d). In addition, the Amendment removed the requirement that a Non-Investment Grade Ratings Event must occur before the Company is required to cause the Additional Guarantee and Collateral Requirement (as defined in the Credit Agreement) to be satisfied. As a result, the Company is required to cause certain of its domestic subsidiaries to become guarantors on the Credit Agreement and the Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries are required to pledge additional collateral. The Amendment to the Credit Agreement was executed on February 28, 2020. The Credit Agreement and the Amendment are discussed more fully in \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d of this Report. If the Company is unable to meet this modified Consolidated Leverage Ratio, or if the Company is unable to further modify it or other provisions of the Credit Agreement in the future, as may be needed, the Company may be held in default, which could result in the termination of the revolving commitments under the Credit Agreement, the acceleration of the obligations under the Credit Agreement, and possibly other debt obligations under other agreements with cross default provisions, pursuit of certain remedies relating to the collateral securing the obligations under Credit Agreement, and the pursuit of other remedies, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nThe Company has outstanding approximately $600 million aggregate principal amount of 4.75% senior notes (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d). The Senior Notes become due on June 1, 2021. The Notes were issued under an indenture (the \u201cIndenture\u201d) between the Company and its 100 percent subsidiary, Dart Industries Inc. (the \u201cGuarantor\u201d) and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee. As security for its obligations under the guarantee of the Senior Notes, the Guarantor has granted a security interest in certain \u201cTupperware\u201d trademarks and service marks. As security for its obligations under the guarantee of the Credit Agreement, the Guarantor has granted a security interest in those certain \u201cTupperware\u201d trademarks and service marks, as well. The Indenture includes, among others, covenants that limit the ability of the Company to raise indebtedness or equity capital under certain circumstances. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for further details regarding the Senior Notes.\nWhether the Company will be able to repay or refinance the Senior Notes will depend on market conditions and the Company\u2019s financial performance at the time. Any refinancing, if at all, of the Senior Notes could be at a higher interest rate and may require the Company to comply with more covenants, which could further restrict the Company's business operations. If the Company is unable to repay or refinance the Senior Notes, the holders of the Seniors Notes may pursue certain remedies relating to the collateral securing the guaranty of the Senior Notes or pursue other remedies, in each case in accordance with the Indenture and the documents relating to such collateral, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nProduct Safety\nCertain of the materials used in the Company\u2019s product lines may give rise to concerns of consumers based upon scientific theories which are espoused from time to time, including the risk of certain materials leaching out of plastic containers used for their intended purposes or the ingredients used in cosmetics, personal care or nutritional products causing harm to human health. This includes polycarbonate, which contains the chemical Bisphenol A, and polyethersulfone, which contains the chemical Bisphenol S. It is the Company\u2019s policy to market products in each of its business units containing only those materials or ingredients that are approved by relevant regulatory authorities for contact with food or skin or for ingestion by consumers, as applicable.\nSenior Leadership Team; Management Succession; Change in CEO\nThe Company\u2019s success depends in part on the efforts and abilities of qualified personnel at all levels, including its senior management team and other key employees. Their motivation, skills, experience, contacts and industry knowledge significantly benefit the Company\u2019s operations and administration. The failure to attract, motivate and retain members of the senior management team could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Since 2018, the composition of the Company\u2019s senior management has changed substantially. On March 12, 2020, the Company announced that Miguel Fernandez would become the Company\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, effective April 6, 2020. Mr. Fernandez replaces the Company's interim Chief Executive Officer, Christopher O\u2019Leary, who will remain a director. On March 12, 2020, the Company also announced that Richard Goudis would become the Company\u2019s Executive Vice Chairman, effective March 12, 2020. Any significant leadership change or senior management transition involves inherent risk and any failure to ensure a smooth transition could hinder the Company\u2019s strategic planning, execution and future performance. A change in the senior management team may create uncertainty among investors, employees and others concerning the Company\u2019s future direction and performance. Any disruption in the Company\u2019s operations or uncertainty could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTechnology and Cyber-Security\nThe Company relies extensively on information technology systems to conduct its business, some of which are managed by third-party service providers. These systems include, but are not limited to, programs and processes relating to internal communications and communications with other parties, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, receiving orders and shipping product to customers, billing customers and receiving and applying payments, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal or tax requirements, collecting and storing certain customer, employee, investor, and other stakeholder information and personal data, and other processes necessary to manage the Company\u2019s business. Current and increased information technology security threats, and current and more sophisticated computer crime, including advanced persistent threats, pose a potential risk to the security of the information technology systems, networks, and services of the Company, its customers and other business partners, as well as the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the data of the Company, its customers and other business partners. As a result, the Company\u2019s information technology systems, networks or service providers could be damaged or cease to function properly or the Company could suffer a loss or disclosure of business, personal or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, including catastrophic events, power outages and security breaches. Although the Company has business continuity plans in place, if these plans do not provide effective alternative processes on a timely basis, the Company may suffer interruptions in its ability to manage or conduct its operations, which may adversely affect its business. The Company may need to expend additional resources in the future to continue to protect against, or to address problems caused by, any business interruptions or data security breaches. Any business interruptions or data security breaches, including cyber-security breaches resulting in private data disclosure, could result in lawsuits or regulatory proceedings, damage the Company\u2019s reputation or adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While the Company maintains insurance coverage that could cover some of these types of issues, the coverage has limitations and includes deductibles such that it may not be adequate to offset losses incurred.\nThe Company could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems or software are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into its operations. Various measures have been implemented to manage the risks related to the implementation and modification of hardware and software, but any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of new or upgraded information technology systems or software could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial position and results of operations and could, if not successfully implemented, adversely impact the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. The Company is continuing to upgrade its systems on a worldwide basis.\nGeneral Business Factors\nThe Company\u2019s business can be affected by a wide range of factors that affect other businesses. Weather, natural disasters, strikes, epidemics/pandemics, political instability, terrorist activity, public scrutiny of the direct selling channel, and changing attitudes regarding plastic products may have a significant impact on the willingness or ability of consumers to attend parties or otherwise purchase the Company\u2019s products. The supply and cost of raw materials, particularly petroleum and natural gas-based resins, may have an impact on the availability or cost of the Company\u2019s plastic products. The Company is also subject to frequent product counterfeiting and other intellectual property infringement, which may be difficult to police and prevent, depending upon the ability to identify infringers and the availability and/or enforceability of intellectual property rights. Other risks, as discussed under the sub-heading \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d contained in Part II, Item 7A of this Report, can be relevant to performance as well.\nGlobal Growth Strategy Initiatives\nIn January 2019, the Company announced an acceleration of investment in its Global Growth Strategy initiatives. Since the inception of the 2019 program, a reassessment of costs and priorities has occurred with a shift from a segment to a global focus with increased emphasis on procurement, sourcing and organizational realignment. The Company expects to invest approximately $50 million through 2021. The areas of strategic focus are driving innovation across products, sales force and consumer experiences; extending access to make it easier for sales force and consumers to connect; deploying technology to drive sales force engagement and consumer connections; contemporizing the service model to allow the sales force to focus on driving revenue; and simplifying and streamlining structures to create a more aligned and integrated organization. Once implemented, the transformation initiatives are expected to enable annual local currency sales growth and to generate about $100 million in annualized savings.\nAs the Company works to complete the transformation initiatives, it may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from one or more of the various restructuring and cost-savings programs undertaken as part of these efforts in full or in part or within the time periods expected. It also may not realize the increase in sales intended to be enabled by the initiatives. The Company's ability to improve its operating results depends upon a significant number of factors, some of which are beyond its control. Other events and circumstances, such as financial and strategic difficulties and delays or unexpected costs, including the impact of foreign currency and inflationary pressures, may occur which could result in not realizing targets or in offsetting the financial benefits of reaching those targets. Reaching those targets may also depend on the level of acceptance by the Company's sales force of its compensation initiatives. If the Company is unable to realize the anticipated savings or benefits, or otherwise fails to invest in the growth initiatives, the business may be adversely affected. In addition, any plans to invest these savings and benefits ahead of future growth means that such costs will be incurred whether or not these savings and benefits are realized. The Company is also subject to the risks of labor unrest, negative publicity and business disruption in connection with these initiatives, and the failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from such initiatives could have a material adverse effect on business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows.\nNatural disasters and unusual weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks (including COVID-19), terrorist acts, global political events and other serious catastrophic events\nThese types of events could disrupt business and otherwise materially adversely affect business and financial condition. With operations in many states and multiple foreign countries, the Company is subject to numerous risks outside of its control, including risks arising from natural disasters, such as fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, unusual weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks and other global health emergencies, terrorist acts or disruptive global political events, or similar disruptions that could materially adversely affect business and financial performance.\nAny public health emergencies, including a real or potential global pandemic such as those caused by the avian flu, SARS, Ebola, coronavirus, or even a particularly virulent flu, could decrease demand for the Company's products and ability to offer them through parties held by the sales force. The recent outbreak in China of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), which has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a \u201cpandemic,\u201d has spread to many countries and is impacting worldwide economic activity. A public health epidemic, including COVID-19, poses the risk that the Company or its employees, contractors, suppliers, sales force, consumers, and other business partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. Currently, the greatest impact of COVID-19 is in China and Asia Pacific, where there are currently highest recorded cases. The Company has a manufacturing facility and generated over $200 million in sales in China in 2019. COVID-19 may impact other geographic areas in which the Company has operations. The Company's top priority is to protect its employees and their families, the sales force and consumers, and its operations from any adverse impacts. The Company is taking precautionary measures as directed by health authorities and the local government. COVID-19 has and may continue to have an impact on ports and trade into and out of China and Hong Kong, as well as travel in the region and globally. Given the interconnectivity of global supply chain and global economy, and the possible rate of future global transmission, the impact of COVID-19 may extend beyond the areas which are currently known to be impacted. While it is not possible at this time to estimate the impact COVID-19 could have on the Company's business, the continued spread of COVID-19 and the measures taken by the governments of countries affected could disrupt the supply chain, the manufacture or shipment of our products, our sales force, and adversely impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nUncharacteristic or significant weather conditions can affect travel and the ability of businesses to remain open, which could lead to decreased ability for sales force to connect with customers and materially adversely affect short-term results of operations. Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could materially adversely affect the Company's reputation, business and financial condition.\nStock Price Volatility; Risk of Delisting\nThe market price of the Company's common stock can be volatile. The Company's common stock is currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d). If the Company does not maintain an average closing price of $1.00 or more over any consecutive 30 trading-day period, the NYSE may initiate proceedings to delist the Company's common stock for failure to maintain compliance with the NYSE price criteria listing standards. A delisting of the Company's Common Stock could result in a reduction in its liquidity and market price.", "PERMNO": 83462, "SIC": 3089, "TIC": "TUP"}
