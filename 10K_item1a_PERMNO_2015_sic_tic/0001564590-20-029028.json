See \u201cDisclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d All amounts disclosed are in thousands except shares, per share amounts, percentages, stores, and number of leases.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, cash flow, liquidity, and results of operations.\nThe spread of the novel coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has caused state and municipal public officials to mandate jurisdiction-wide curfews, including \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d and closures of most non-essential businesses as well as other measures to mitigate the spread of the virus. While we continue to serve our customers through our online e-commerce websites, we were forced to shut down all of our domestic and international retail locations alongside other retailers, including our wholesale partners, which has resulted in a sharp decline in our revenue and ability to generate cash flows from operations. Although certain jurisdictions have since loosened the restrictive orders and a limited number of our retail stores have re-opened, the extent of the negative impact of COVID-19 on our operations remains uncertain and potentially wide-spread, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully execute our long-term growth strategy during these uncertain times;\n\u2022\ntemporary closures and/or re-closures of our stores, distribution centers, and corporate facilities for unknown periods of time, as well as those of our wholesale partners;\n\u2022\npotential declines in the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and luxury retail products, including our products, caused by lower disposable income levels, travel restrictions, or other factors beyond our control;\n\u2022\nthe potential build-up of excess inventory as a result of store closures and/or lower consumer demand, including those resulting from potential changes in consumer traffic, shopping preferences, such as their willingness to shop at our or our wholesale partners\u2019 retail locations;\n\u2022\nsupply chain disruptions resulting from closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials, and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;\n\u2022\nour ability to access capital sources and maintain compliance with our credit facilities, as well as the ability of our key customers, suppliers, and vendors to do the same in regard to their own obligations;\n\u2022\nour ability to collect outstanding receivables from our customers; and\n\u2022\ndiversion of management and employee attention and resources from key business activities and risk management outside of COVID-19 response efforts, including cybersecurity and maintenance of internal controls.\nTo date, we have taken various measures in response to COVID-19, as further described in Item 1. Business - Recent Developments. The COVID-19 pandemic remains highly volatile and continues to evolve on a daily basis and therefore, despite these efforts and developments, there can be no assurance that these measures will prove successful and these and other impacts of COVID-19 are expected to continue to adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, cash flow, liquidity and results of operations.\nOur ability to continue to have the liquidity necessary to service our debt, meet contractual payment obligations and fund our operations depends on many factors, including our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, maintain adequate availability under our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility or obtain other financing.\nOur ability to timely service our indebtedness, meet contractual payment obligations and to fund our operations will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash, either through cash flows from operations or borrowing availability under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below), and our ability to access the capital markets if other sources of financing are unavailable on acceptable terms. Our primary cash needs are funding working capital requirements, meeting debt service requirements, paying amounts due under the Tax Receivable Agreement and capital expenditures for new stores and related leasehold improvements.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted, and is expected to continue to negatively impact, our liquidity. See \u201c- The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, cash flow, liquidity and results of operations.\u201d While we believe we will have sufficient liquidity for the next twelve months, there can be no assurances in the future that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our liquidity needs, that we will have the necessary availability under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, or be able to obtain other financing when liquidity needs\narise. In particular, our ability to continue to meet our obligations is dependent on our ability to generate positive cash flow from a combination of initiatives and failure to successfully implement these initiatives would require us to implement alternative plans to satisfy our liquidity needs. In the event that we are unable to timely service our debt, meet other contractual payment obligations or fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity, seek waivers of or amendments to our contractual obligations for payment, reduce or delay scheduled expansions and capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations or seek other financing opportunities. There can be no assurance that these options would be readily available to us and our inability to address our liquidity needs could materially and adversely affect our operations and jeopardize our business, financial condition and results of operations, including causing defaults under the 2018 Term Loan Facility (as defined below) or the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility which could result in all amounts outstanding under those credit facilities becoming immediately due and payable.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing retail and office space, are historically subject to long-term non-cancelable leases and are required to make substantial lease payments under our operating leases, and any failure to make these lease payments when due would likely harm our business, profitability and results of operations.\nWe do not own any of our stores or our offices, including our New York, Los Angeles or Paris offices and showroom spaces, but instead lease all of such space under operating leases. Although some of our leases are subject to shorter terms as a result of the implementation of our strategy to pursue shorter lease terms, our leases generally have initial terms of 10 years, and generally can be extended only for one additional 5-year term. Substantially all of our leases require a fixed annual rent, and most require the payment of additional rent if store sales exceed a negotiated amount. Most of our leases are \u201cnet\u201d leases, which require us to pay the cost of insurance, taxes, maintenance, and utilities, and we generally cannot cancel these leases at our option. Additionally, certain of our leases allow the lessor to terminate the lease if we do not achieve a specified gross sales threshold. We cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve these required thresholds and in the event we are no able to do so, we may be forced to find an alternative store location and may not be successful in doing so. Any loss of our store locations due to underperformance may harm our results of operations, stock price and reputation.\nPayments under these leases account for a significant portion of our selling, general and administrative expenses. For example, as of February 1, 2020, we were a party to 76 operating leases associated with our retail stores and our office and showroom spaces requiring future minimum lease payments of $27,472 in the aggregate through fiscal 2020 and $106,438 thereafter. Any new retail stores leased by us under operating leases will further increase our operating lease expenses and some of those stores may require significant capital expenditures. Our substantial operating lease obligations could have significant negative consequences, including, among others:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our available cash to pay our rental obligations, thus reducing cash available for other purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry in which we compete; and\n\u2022\nplacing us at a disadvantage with respect to some of our competitors.\nWe depend on cash flow from operations to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities, and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from borrowings under our credit facilities or from other sources, we may not be able to service our operating lease expenses, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which would harm our business. In addition, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among other things, payment of the base rent for the remaining lease term, even after the space is exited or otherwise closed (such as our recent temporary store closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic). Such costs and obligations related to the early or temporary closure of our stores or termination of our leases could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among others, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term if we cannot negotiate a mutually acceptable termination payment. In addition, as our leases expire, we may fail to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, or to find a suitable alternative location, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations or in the case of office leases, incur costs in relocating our office space. In fiscal 2020, six of our existing store leases will expire. If we are unable to enter into new leases or renew existing leases on terms acceptable to us or be released from our obligations under leases for stores that we close, our business, profitability and results of operations may be harmed.\nGeneral economic conditions in the U.S. and other parts of the world, including a weakening of the economy and restricted credit markets, can affect consumer confidence and consumer spending patterns.\nThe success of our operations depends on consumer spending. Consumer spending is impacted by a number of factors, including actual and perceived economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income (such as unemployment, wages, energy costs and consumer debt levels), customer traffic within shopping and selling environments, business conditions, interest rates and availability\nof credit and tax rates in the general economy and in the international, regional and local markets in which our products are sold, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Global economic conditions historically included significant recessionary pressures and declines in employment levels, disposable income and actual and/or perceived wealth and further declines in consumer confidence and economic growth. A depressed economic environment is often characterized by a decline in consumer discretionary spending and has disproportionately affected retailers and sellers of consumer goods, particularly those whose goods are viewed as discretionary or luxury purchases, including fashion apparel and accessories such as ours. Such factors as well as another shift towards recessionary conditions have impacted, and could further adversely impact, our sales volumes and overall profitability. Further, economic and political volatility and declines in the value of foreign currencies could negatively impact the global economy as a whole and have a material adverse effect on the profitability and liquidity of our operations, as well as hinder our ability to grow through expansion in the international markets. In addition, domestic and international political situations also affect consumer confidence, including the threat, outbreak or escalation of terrorism, military conflicts, or other hostilities around the world.\nOur operations are restricted by our credit facilities.\nIn August 2018, we entered into an $80,000 senior secured revolving credit facility (the \u201c2018 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) and a $27,500 senior secured term loan facility (the \u201c2018 Term Loan Facility\u201d), which replaced our prior $50,000 senior secured revolving credit facility (the \u201c2013 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) and $175,000 senior secured term loan facility (the \u201c2013 Term Loan Facility\u201d). In November 2019, in connection with the Acquisition, we increased the aggregate commitments under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility to $100,000 by exercising the accordion feature thereunder. The Acquired Businesses became guarantors under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2018 Term Loan Facility and jointly and severally liable for the obligations thereunder.\nOur credit facilities contain significant restrictive covenants. These covenants may impair our financing and operational flexibility and make it difficult for us to react to market conditions and satisfy our ongoing capital needs and unanticipated cash requirements. Specifically, such covenants restrict our ability and, if applicable, the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional debt;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022\nenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nuse assets as security in other transactions;\n\u2022\npay dividends;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets or merge with or into other companies;\n\u2022\nguarantee the debt of others;\n\u2022\nenter into new lines of businesses;\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem, or exchange our debt; and\n\u2022\nform any joint ventures or subsidiary investments.\nOur credit facilities also contain certain financial covenants, including a covenant under the 2018 Term Loan Facility requiring us to maintain a specified Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio. In June 2020, we entered into the Third Amendment (the \u201cThird Term Loan Amendment\u201d) to the 2018 Term Loan Facility, which amendment suspended such requirement through the delivery of a compliance certificate relating to the fiscal quarter ending July 31, 2021, and replaced it with a springing covenant, under which the obligation to maintain a specified Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.0 to 1.0 is triggered only when the Excess Availability under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility falls below $15,000, or for the period between September 30, 2020 and January 30, 2021, $10,000. See Amendments to 2018 Term Loan Facility under Note 15 \u201cSubsequent Events\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for more details.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants, including the springing covenant describe above, and other terms of our debt obligations, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, will depend on our future operating performance. If we fail to comply with such covenants and terms, and are unable to cure such failure under the terms of our credit facilities, if applicable, we would be required to obtain additional waivers from our lenders to maintain compliance with our debt obligations. If we are unable to obtain any necessary waivers and the debt is accelerated, a material adverse effect on our financial condition and future operating performance would likely result.\nThe terms of our debt obligations and the amount of borrowing availability under our credit facilities may also restrict or delay our ability to fulfill our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement. In accordance with the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement, delayed or unpaid amounts thereunder would accrue interest at a default rate of one-year London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) plus 500 basis points until paid. Our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could result in a failure to comply with covenants or financial ratios required by our existing or future credit facilities and could result in an event of default thereunder. See \u201cTax Receivable Agreement\u201d under Note 14 \u201cRelated Party Transactions\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on for further information.\nThe proposed phase-out of LIBOR could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nBorrowings under our credit facilities bear interest at a rate that varies depending on the LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it would phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, announced replacement of U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by U.S. Treasury securities called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). The first publication of SOFR was released in April 2018. Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question and the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain. If LIBOR rates are no longer available, our costs of borrowings under our credit facilities may be negatively impacted, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe Rebecca Taylor and Parker brands may not be successfully integrated and the Acquisition may not achieve its intended benefits.\nWe face risks associated with our strategy to grow our business through acquisitions of other brands and geographic licensees, such as our recently completed acquisition of the Rebecca Taylor and Parker brands. The potential difficulties that we may face that could cause the results of the Acquisition, including any anticipated operational synergies, to not be in line with our expectations include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nfailure to implement our business plan for the combined business or to achieve anticipated revenue or profitability targets;\n\u2022\ndelays or difficulties in completing the integration of Acquired Businesses;\n\u2022\nhigher than expected costs, lower than expected cost savings and/or a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties;\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues in integrating logistics, information and other systems;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nretaining key customers, suppliers, and employees across brands;\n\u2022\noperating risks inherent in the Acquired Businesses and our business;\n\u2022\ndiversion of the attention and resources of management and resource constraints;\n\u2022\nassumption of liabilities not identified in due diligence or other unanticipated issues, expenses, and liabilities; and\n\u2022\nregulatory and compliance risks, including, the impact on our internal controls and compliance with the requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (\u201cSOX\u201d), particularly upon the acquisition of historically privately held businesses, which have not previously been subject to regulations applicable to the Company.\nContemporary Lifestyle Group, LLC (\u201cCLG\u201d), the seller of Rebecca Taylor and Parker brands, is owned by Sun Capital, which currently beneficially owns approximately 73% of the Company\u2019s common stock. Because the Acquisition was a transaction between commonly controlled entities, U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles requires the retrospective combination of the entities for all periods presented as if the combination had been in effect since inception of common control. Accordingly, the Acquisition reflects historical balance sheet data for the Acquired Businesses instead of reflecting the fair market value of their assets and liabilities, and the financial statements reflecting the acquisition are different from and may yield worse results of operations than those based on an unaffiliated transaction.\nOur acquisition of the Acquired Businesses may not perform as well as initially expected, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Acquired Businesses recorded impairment charges of $19,491 relating to goodwill, tradename, and customer relationship intangible assets. We may in the future be required to record further impairment charges relating to the assets of the Acquired Businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur post-closing recourse with respect to the Acquisition is limited under the related purchase agreement. We obtained and paid for a representation and warranty insurance containing customary terms and conditions, which policy is our sole recourse for any losses we may suffer due to breaches of the representations and warranties of CLG and the Acquired Businesses in the purchase agreement other than fraud. We may continue to pursue future acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. Any such acquisition may subject us to further risks as those described above and could have a material adverse effect on the combined businesses and impact the intended results of such acquisitions.\nWe may not be able to realize the benefits of our strategic initiatives.\nOur business growth depends on the successful execution of our strategic initiatives for the three brands. However, the continued success of our strategic initiatives depends on a number of factors including our ability to position our retail and e-commerce businesses for further strategic growth, the effectiveness of our collaboration efforts with Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus Group, including marketing and logistics initiatives, our ability to properly identify appropriate future growth opportunities, our ability to apply certain growth strategies modeled on the Vince brand to the Acquired Businesses and macroeconomic impact on our business, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, we entered into limited distribution arrangements with Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus Group for non-licensed product in order to rationalize our department store distribution strategy to improve profitability in the Vince Wholesale segment and to focus on other areas of growth for the brand, particularly in the direct-to-consumer business. During fiscal 2018, we implemented these strategic initiatives to capture the sales from exited wholesale doors through our retail and e-commerce businesses while collaborating with the wholesale partners in various areas including merchandising and logistics to build a more profitable and focused wholesale business. However, in May 2020, Neiman Marcus Group commenced voluntary proceedings under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, as amended (\u201cChapter 11\u201d). As a result of these proceedings, any unpaid payments due to us for the period prior to the commencement of those proceedings are unsecured claims, which may not be paid in full, and the proceedings may in the future lead to a disruption in our ongoing partnership with Neiman Marcus Group. There can be no assurance that the strategic initiatives would produce intended positive results. Moreover, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, some or all of the strategic initiatives contemplated prior to the pandemic may become infeasible or impractical in the post-pandemic operating environment. If we are unable to realize the benefits of the strategic initiatives, our financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of large wholesale partners, and the loss of any of these wholesale partners could substantially reduce our total revenue.\nWe historically had a small number of wholesale partners who account for a significant portion of our net sales. Our consolidated net sales to the full-price, off-price and e-commerce operations of our largest wholesale partner comprised 22% of our total revenue for fiscal 2019. This reflects the impact on the wholesale partnership base of the limited distribution arrangements with Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus Group with respect to the Vince brand. We do not have formal written agreements with any of our wholesale partners and purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis. A decision by any of our major wholesale partners, whether motivated by marketing strategy, competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to significantly decrease the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing partners, to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing partners, or with respect to Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus Group, to no longer participate in limited distribution arrangements for the Vince brand, could substantially reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our profitability. Furthermore, due to the concentration of and/or ownership changes in our wholesale partner base, our results of operations could be adversely affected if any of these wholesale partners fails to satisfy its payment obligations to us when due or no longer takes part in the distribution arrangements. These changes could also decrease our opportunities in the market and decrease our negotiating strength with our wholesale partners. Furthermore, our wholesale partners, including Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus Group have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, along with the other wholesalers, and may become unable to continue business with us as they had pre-pandemic. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results, especially in light of our new limited wholesale distribution strategy. See \u201c-We may not be able to realize the benefits of our strategic initiatives\u201d for more information on Neiman Marcus Group\u2019s Chapter 11 proceedings.\nOne of our strategic initiatives is to focus on our direct-to-consumer business, which includes opening retail stores in select locations under more favorable and shorter lease terms and operating and maintaining our new and existing retail stores successfully. If we are unable to execute this strategy in a timely manner, or at all, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nAs part of our strategy to increase focus on our direct-to-consumer business, we continue to seek retail opportunities in targeted streets or malls with desirable size and adjacencies, typically near luxury retailers that we believe are consistent with our key customers\u2019 demographics and shopping preferences, and seek to negotiate more favorable leases including shorter terms. The success of this strategy depends on a number of factors, including the discussions with existing and new landlords in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, identification of suitable markets and sites, negotiation of acceptable lease terms while securing those favorable locations, including desired term, rent and tenant improvement allowances, and if entering a new market, the timely achievement of brand awareness and proper evaluation of the market particularly for locations with shorter term, affinity and purchase intent in that market, as well as our business condition in funding the opening and operations of stores. Furthermore, we may not be able to maintain the successful operation of our retail stores if the areas around our existing retail locations undergo changes that result in reductions in customer foot traffic or otherwise render the locations unsuitable, such as economic downturns in the area, changes in demographics and customer preferences and the closing or decline in popularity of adjacent stores. During fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, we recorded non-cash asset impairment charges of $818 and $1,684, respectively, within selling, general and administrative expenses related to the impairment of property and equipment of certain retail stores with carrying values that were determined not to be recoverable and\nexceeded fair value and operating lease right-of-use assets. If we are unable to successfully implement our retail strategy, particularly given the impact on the retail market from the COVID-19 pandemic, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, including the potential of further impairments of tangible assets.\nAs of February 1, 2020, we operated 68 stores, including 47 company-operated Vince full-price stores, 6 company-operated Rebecca Taylor full-price stores, and 14 company-operated Vince outlet stores throughout the United States and one company-operated Vince full price store in the United Kingdom. We plan to continue evaluating our store base consistent with the current operating environment.\nOur plans to improve and expand our product offerings may not be successful, and the implementation of these plans may divert our operational, managerial, and administrative resources, which could harm our competitive position and reduce our net sales and profitability.\nWe may continue to grow our core product offerings and categories such as lifestyle products and inclusive.\nThe principal risks to our ability to successfully carry out our plans to improve and expand our product offerings are that:\n\u2022\nif our expected product offerings fail to maintain and enhance our brand identity, our image may be diminished or diluted, and our sales may decrease;\n\u2022\nif we fail to find and enter into relationships with external partners with the necessary specialized expertise or execution capabilities, we may be unable to offer our planned product extensions or to realize the additional revenue we have targeted for those extensions;\n\u2022\nthe use of licensing partners or other external suppliers may limit our ability to conduct comprehensive final quality checks on merchandise before it is shipped to our stores or to our wholesale partners; and\n\u2022\nour exposure to product liability claims may increase as we add product categories that have different liability profiles than those of our historical product offerings.\nIn addition, our ability to successfully carry out our plans to improve and expand our product offerings may be affected by economic and competitive conditions, changes in consumer spending patterns and changes in consumer preferences and style trends, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. These plans could be abandoned, cost more than anticipated or divert resources from other areas of our business, any of which could negatively impact our competitive position and reduce our net revenue and profitability.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nIn fiscal 2019, and fiscal 2018 we identified and concluded that we have material weaknesses relating to our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of an entity\u2019s financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As further described in Part II, Item 9A in this Annual Report, during fiscal 2018, we took specific steps to remediate such material weaknesses by implementing and enhancing our control procedures and as a result, remediated three out of the four previously identified material weaknesses as of the end of fiscal 2018. Although during fiscal 2019 we made significant progress on our comprehensive remediation plan related to the remaining material weakness, the remaining material weakness will not be remediated until all necessary internal controls have been implemented, tested and determined to be operating effectively. In addition, we may need to take additional measures to address such material weakness or modify the planned remediation steps, and we cannot be certain that the measures we have taken, and expect to take, to improve our internal controls will be sufficient to address the issues identified, to ensure that our internal controls are effective or to ensure that the identified material weakness will not result in a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements. Moreover, although no additional material weakness was identified in fiscal 2019, other material weaknesses or deficiencies may develop or be identified in the future. If we are unable to correct material weaknesses or deficiencies in internal controls in a timely manner, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, will be adversely affected. This failure could negatively affect the market price and trading liquidity of our common stock, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, subject us to civil and criminal investigations and penalties, and otherwise materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, we recently acquired Rebecca Taylor and Parker, which were previously not subject to regulations promulgated under SOX and accordingly were not required to establish and maintain an internal control infrastructure meeting the standards promulgated under SOX. Our assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of February 1, 2020 did not include the internal controls of Rebecca Taylor and Parker, all of which we acquired during fiscal 2019. Although our management will continue to review and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls in light of the Acquisition, we cannot provide any assurances that there will be no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the internal control structure of the Acquired Businesses. Any significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in the internal control structure of the Acquired Businesses may cause additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or\ncause us to incur significant costs to remedy such significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to comply with Section 404 of SOX. For so long as we remain a \u201cnon-accelerated filer\u201d under the rules of the SEC, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to deliver an annual attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We will cease to be a non-accelerated filer if the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter is $75 million or more, in which case we would become subject to the requirement for an annual attestation report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe are continuing to optimize and improve our information technology systems, processes, and functions. If these systems, processes, and functions do not operate successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially harmed.\nWe underwent a systems migration in 2016 and implemented our own information technology systems, processes, and functions, which we are continuing to optimize and improve. During the first half of fiscal 2017, these systems we implemented did not operate as successfully as the systems we historically used as such systems were highly customized or proprietary, which resulted in disruptions to our business, such as delayed shipments which resulted in order cancellations, and identified material weaknesses in our internal controls. Although we have made progress in our efforts to optimize these systems, processes, and functions, we also incurred costs through those efforts. If we fail in our efforts to continue optimizing and improving these systems, processes and functions as currently planned, we could incur further disruptions to our business operations, including deficiencies or weaknesses in our internal controls, as well as additional costs to replace those systems and functions. We may also be forced to adopt less capable alternatives. Any of these would materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nIn addition, we may in the future migrate Rebecca Taylor and Parker information technology systems, processes, and functions to those of Vince as part of the integration efforts. There is no guarantee that such migration would be conducted in the most cost-efficient manner and/or any disruption arising out of such migration would not have a material negative impact on our businesses.\nSystem or data security issues, such as cyber or malware attacks, as well as other major system failures could disrupt our internal operations or information technology services, and any such disruption could negatively impact our net sales, increase our expenses and harm our reputation.\nExperienced computer programmers and hackers, and even internal users, may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties, including our customers, enter into or facilitate fraudulent transactions, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. In addition, employee error, malfeasance, or other errors in the storage, use or transmission of any such information could result in a disclosure to third parties outside of our network. The increased use of smartphones, tablets, and other wireless devices, as well as the need for a substantial portion of our corporate employees to work remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, may also heighten these and other operational risks. As a result, we could incur significant expenses addressing problems created by any such inadvertent disclosure or any security breaches of our network. In addition, we rely on third parties for the operation of our websites and for the various business strategies, including CRM, social media and other marketing tools and websites.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to system or data security problems, including viruses and bugs, including a recent temporary company-wide systems outage that was caused by a malware. None of these incidents, including the most recent event, has resulted in any data or information breaches or any other material impact to our business and/or financial results. There is no assurance, however, that we would not be subject to material security problems in the future, including cyber or malware attacks, and we could incur significant expenses or disruptions of our operations in connection with resulting system failures or data and information breaches. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \u201cbugs\u201d and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of our systems. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate security problems, viruses and bugs could be significant, and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service that may impede our sales, distribution or other critical functions.\nConcerns have been increasing over the security of personal information transmitted over the internet and personal identity theft and user privacy. Any compromise of personal information of our customers or employees could subject us to litigation and/or penalties and harm our reputation, materially and adversely affecting our business and growth. In addition to taking the necessary precautions ourselves, we require that third-party service providers implement reasonable security measures to protect our customers\u2019 or employees\u2019 identity and privacy, including any personally identifiable information and credit card information. We do not, however, control these third-party service providers and cannot guarantee that no electronic or physical computer break-ins and security breaches will occur in the future.\nIn the case of a disaster affecting our information technology systems, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support our operations and\nother breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with privacy-related obligations, including privacy laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally as well as other legal obligations, could materially adversely affect our business.\nA variety of laws and regulations, in the U.S. and internationally, govern the collection, use, retention, sharing, transfer and security of personally identifiable information and data, including the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective during fiscal 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective on January 1, 2020. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, self-regulatory requirements, policies and legal obligations relating to privacy, data usage, and data protection. It is possible, however, that these laws, rules and regulations, which evolve frequently and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another, could be interpreted to conflict with our practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us or any third parties with which we do business to comply with these laws, rules and regulations, or with other obligations to which we may be or become subject, may result in actions against us by governmental entities, private claims and litigation, fines, penalties or other liabilities. Any such action would be expensive to defend, could damage our reputation and could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nChanges in laws could make conducting our business more expensive or otherwise change the way we do business.\nWe are subject to numerous domestic and international regulations, including labor and employment, wage and hour, customs, truth-in-advertising, consumer protection, data and privacy protection, and zoning and occupancy laws and ordinances that regulate retailers generally or govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. If these regulations were to change or were violated by our management, employees, vendors, independent manufacturers or partners, the costs of certain goods could increase, or we could experience delays in shipments of our products, be subject to fines or penalties, or suffer reputational harm, which could reduce demand for our merchandise and hurt our business and results of operations.\nIn addition to increased regulatory compliance requirements, changes in laws could make ordinary conduct of business more expensive or require us to change the way we do business. For example, privacy-related laws, regulations, self-regulatory obligations and other legal obligations are evolving and various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current laws or enact new laws regarding privacy matters, and courts may interpret existing privacy-related laws and regulations in new or different manners. CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020, imposes additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California and provides for substantial fines for non-compliance and, in some cases, a private right of action to consumers who are victims of data breaches. It is unclear how CCPA will be implemented as the California legislature is still engaged in additional rulemaking under CCPA. In addition, it is uncertain how the so-called \u201cBrexit\u201d may impact GDPR and privacy and data concerns and regulations involving the United Kingdom. Changes in privacy-related laws, regulations, self-regulatory obligations and other legal obligations, or changes in industry standards or consumer sentiment, could require us to incur substantial costs or to change our business practices, including changing, limiting or ceasing altogether the collection, use, sharing, or transfer of data relating to consumers. Any of these effects could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. As another example, changes in federal and state minimum wage laws could raise the wage requirements for certain of our employees at our retail locations, which would increase our selling costs and may cause us to reexamine our wage structure for such employees. Other laws related to employee benefits and treatment of employees, including laws related to limitations on employee hours, supervisory status, leaves of absence, mandated health benefits, overtime pay, unemployment tax rates and citizenship requirements, could negatively impact us, by increasing compensation and benefits costs which would in turn reduce our profitability.\nMoreover, changes in product safety or other consumer protection laws could lead to increased costs to us for certain merchandise, or additional labor costs associated with readying merchandise for sale. It is often difficult for us to plan and prepare for potential changes to applicable laws and future actions or payments related to such changes could be material to us.\nFurthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has led various jurisdictions and regulators to impose strict rules and guidelines on how to operate retail stores as well as office facilities, with respect to health and safety, including those of customers and employees. If we fail to comply with these new sets of rules and guidelines, or we do not, or are perceived to not, follow industry standards of health and safety, our operations, including our reputation, could be negatively impacted and maintaining such compliance could become costly and operationally burdensome.\nProblems with our distribution process could materially harm our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sale transactions, and achieve targeted operating efficiencies.\nIn the U.S., we rely on distribution facilities operated by third-party logistics providers in California. Our ability to meet the needs of our wholesale partners and our own direct-to-consumer business depends on the proper operation of these distribution facilities. Because substantially all of our products are distributed from one location, our operations could be interrupted by labor difficulties, or by floods, fires, earthquakes or other natural disasters and health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, at or near\nsuch facility. For example, a majority of our ocean shipments go through the ports in Los Angeles, which had previously been subject to significant processing delays due to labor issues involving the port workers. We also have warehouses overseas, including in Hong Kong, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Canada, operated by third-party logistics providers, supporting our wholesale orders for customers located primarily in the nearby regions. Disruptions at any of these facilities located outside the U.S. could also materially and negatively impact the business.\nWe maintain business interruption insurance. These policies, however, may not adequately protect us from the adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions to our distribution system. If we encounter problems with any of our distribution processes, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales, and achieve targeted operating efficiencies could be harmed. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe may in the future integrate the warehouse operations of the Acquired Businesses to those of Vince. If such integration efforts do not progress as planned, or at all, our business operations may be significantly disrupted, materially and adversely impacting our business results.\nIf we are unable to accurately forecast customer demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to deliver products to meet our requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of products to our stores, wholesale partners and e-commerce customers, or we could face issues relating to excess inventory.\nWe stock our stores, and provide inventory to our wholesale partners, based on our or their estimates of future demand for particular products. Our inventory management and planning team determines the number of pieces of each product that we will order from our manufacturers based upon past sales of similar products, sales trend information and anticipated demand at our suggested retail prices. However, if our inventory and planning team fails to accurately forecast customer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage our inventory at a level appropriate for future customer demand.\nFactors that could affect our inventory management and planning team\u2019s ability to accurately forecast customer demand for our products include:\n\u2022\na substantial increase or decrease in demand for our products or for products of our competitors;\n\u2022\nour failure to accurately forecast customer acceptance for our new products;\n\u2022\nnew product introductions or pricing strategies by competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in our product items across seasonal fashion items and replenishment;\n\u2022\nchanges to our overall seasonal promotional cadence and the number and timing of promotional events;\n\u2022\nmore limited historical store sales information for our newer markets;\n\u2022\nweakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in the future, such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our products;\n\u2022\ninability to operate our retail stores as intended, such as the mandated closures of all retail stores experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022\nacts or threats of war or terrorism which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or interrupt production and distribution of our products and our raw materials.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to match supply with demand in all cases in the future, whether as a result of our inability to produce sufficient levels of desirable product or our failure to forecast demand accurately. As a result of these inabilities or failures, we may in the future encounter further difficulties in filling customer orders or in liquidating excess inventory at discount prices and may experience significant write-offs. Additionally, if we over-produce a product based on an aggressive forecast of demand, retailers may not be able to sell the product and cancel future orders or require give backs. These outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our brand images, sales, gross margins, and profitability.\nIntense competition in the apparel and fashion industry could reduce our sales and profitability.\nAs a fashion company, we face intense competition from other domestic and foreign apparel, footwear and accessories manufacturers and retailers. Competition has and may continue to result in pricing pressures, reduced profit margins, lost market share or failure to grow our market share, any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations. Competition is based on many factors including, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022\nestablishing and maintaining favorable brand recognition;\n\u2022\ndeveloping products that appeal to consumers;\n\u2022\npricing products appropriately;\n\u2022\ndetermining and maintaining product quality;\n\u2022\nobtaining access to sufficient floor space in retail locations;\n\u2022\nproviding appropriate services and support to retailers;\n\u2022\nmaintaining and growing market share;\n\u2022\ndeveloping and maintaining a competitive e-commerce site;\n\u2022\nhiring and retaining key employees; and\n\u2022\nprotecting intellectual property.\nCompetition in the apparel and fashion industry is intense and is dominated by a number of very large brands, many of which have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, more established relationships with a broader set of suppliers, greater brand recognition and greater financial, research and development, marketing, distribution and other resources than we do. These capabilities of our competitors may allow them to better withstand downturns in the economy or apparel and fashion industry. Any increased competition, or our failure to adequately address any of these competitive factors which we have seen from time to time, could result in reduced sales, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nCompetition, along with such other factors as consolidation within the retail industry and changes in consumer spending patterns, could also result in significant pricing pressure and cause the sales environment to be more promotional, as it has been in recent years, impacting our financial results. If promotional pressure remains intense, either through actions of our competitors or through customer expectations, this may cause a further reduction in our sales and gross margins and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur business depends on a strong brand image, and if we are not able to maintain or enhance our brands, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition, we may be unable to sell sufficient quantities of our merchandise, which would harm our business and cause our results of operations to suffer.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to maintaining and expanding our customer base. Maintaining and enhancing our brands may require us to make substantial investments in areas such as visual merchandising, marketing, and advertising, employee training and store operations. Certain of our competitors in the fashion industry have faced adverse publicity surrounding the quality, attributes and performance of their products or company culture. Any or all our brands may similarly be adversely affected if our public image or reputation is tarnished by failing to maintain high standards for merchandise quality and corporate integrity. Any negative publicity about these types of concerns may reduce demand for our merchandise. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to be a leading global contemporary group of apparel and accessories brands and to continue to provide high quality products. Moreover, we anticipate that, as our business expands into new markets and further penetrates existing markets, and as the markets in which we operate become increasingly competitive, maintaining, and enhancing our brands may become increasingly difficult and expensive. If we are unable to maintain or enhance our brand images, our results of operations may suffer and our business may be harmed.\nIf we lose any key personnel, are unable to attract key personnel, or assimilate and retain our key personnel, we may not be able to successfully operate or grow our business.\nOur continued success is dependent on our ability to attract, assimilate, retain, and motivate qualified management, designers, administrative talent, and sales associates to support existing operations and future growth. Competition for qualified talent in the apparel and fashion industry is intense, and we compete for these individuals with other companies that in many cases have greater financial and other resources. The loss of the services of any members of senior management or the inability to attract and retain qualified executives could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we will need to continue to attract, assimilate, retain, and motivate highly talented employees with a range of other skills and experience. Competition for employees in our industry, especially at the store management levels, is intense and we may from time to time experience difficulty in retaining our associates or attracting the additional talent necessary to support the growth of our business. We will also need to attract, assimilate, and retain other professionals across a range of disciplines, including design, production, sourcing, and international business, as we develop new product categories and continue to expand our international presence.\nOur competitive position could suffer if our intellectual property rights are not protected.\nWe believe that our trademarks and designs are of great value. From time to time, third parties have challenged, and may in the future try to challenge, our ownership of our intellectual property. In some cases, third parties with similar trademarks or other intellectual property may have pre-existing and potentially conflicting trademark registrations. We rely on cooperation from third parties with similar trademarks to be able to register our trademarks in jurisdictions in which such third parties have already registered their trademarks. We are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing our intellectual property rights. Imitation or counterfeiting of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands or otherwise adversely affect our revenues. The actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate our trademarks or block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others. In addition, others may assert\nrights in, or ownership of, our trademarks and other intellectual property rights or in similar marks or marks that we license and/or market and we may not be able to successfully resolve these conflicts to our satisfaction. We may need to resort to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. Successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling some of our products. In addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights from third parties or cease using those rights altogether. Any of these events could harm our business and cause our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition to suffer.\nWe license our Vince website domain name from a third-party. Pursuant to the license agreement (the \u201cDomain License Agreement\u201d), our license to use www.vince.com automatically renews on an annual basis, subject to our right to terminate the arrangement with or without cause; provided, that we must pay the applicable early termination fee and provide 30 days prior notice in connection with a termination without cause. The licensor has no termination rights under the Domain License Agreement. Any failure by the licensor to perform its obligations under the Domain License Agreement could adversely affect our brand and make it more difficult for users to find our website.\nOur limited operating experience and brand recognition in international markets may delay our expansion strategy and cause our business and growth to suffer.\nWe face risks with respect to our strategy to expand internationally, including our efforts to further expand our business in Canada, select European countries, Asia, including China, and the Middle East through company-operated locations, wholesale arrangements as well as with international partners. Our current operations are based largely in the U.S., with international wholesale sales representing 8% of net sales for fiscal 2019. Therefore, we have a limited number of customers and experience in operating outside of the U.S. We also do not have extensive experience with regulatory environments and market practices outside of the U.S. and cannot guarantee, notwithstanding our international partners\u2019 familiarity with such environments and market practices, that we will be able to penetrate or successfully operate in any market outside of the U.S. Many of these markets have different operational characteristics, including employment and labor regulations, transportation, logistics, real estate (including lease terms) and local reporting or legal requirements, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the international markets which remain unclear.\nFurthermore, consumer demand and behavior, as well as style preferences, size and fit, and purchasing trends, may differ in these markets and, as a result, sales of our product may not be successful, or the margins on those sales may not be in line with those that we currently anticipate. In addition, in many of these markets there is significant competition to attract and retain experienced and talented employees. Failure to develop new markets outside of the U.S. or disappointing sales growth outside of the U.S. may harm our business and results of operations.\nIn particular, we are subject to the laws of the United Kingdom as well as France through our operations in the respective areas, including tax, employment, and corporate laws. We may also enter into other foreign jurisdictions and become subject to the laws of those jurisdictions in the future. If we fail to comply with some or all of those laws, we may be subject to fines or penalties that could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nOur current and future licensing arrangements may not be successful and may make us susceptible to the actions of third parties over whom we have limited control.\nWe currently have product licensing agreements for Vince women\u2019s footwear and men\u2019s footwear and on a limited basis, Vince fragrance. In the future, we may enter into select additional licensing arrangements for product offerings which require specialized expertise. In addition, we have entered into select licensing agreements pursuant to which we have granted certain third parties the right to distribute and sell our products in certain geographic areas, and may continue to do so in the future. Although we have taken and will continue to take steps to select potential licensing partners carefully and monitor the activities of our existing licensing partners (through, among other things, approval rights over product design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, marketing, distribution and advertising), such arrangements may not be successful. Our licensing partners may fail to fulfill their obligations under their license agreements or have interests that differ from or conflict with our own, such as the pricing of our products and the offering of competitive products. In addition, the risks applicable to the business of our licensing partners may be different than the risks applicable to our business, including risks associated with each such partner\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022\nreact successfully to pandemic diseases such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nobtain capital;\n\u2022\nexercise operational and financial control over its business;\n\u2022\nmaintain relationships with suppliers;\n\u2022\nmanage its credit and bankruptcy risks; and\n\u2022\nmaintain customer relationships.\nAny of the foregoing risks, or the inability of any of our licensing partners to successfully market our products or otherwise conduct its business, may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in regions or product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements.\nThe extent of our foreign sourcing may adversely affect our business.\nWe work with more than 60 manufacturers across eight countries, with 88% of our products produced in China in fiscal 2019. A manufacturing contractor\u2019s failure to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet the required quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items. The failure to make timely deliveries may cause customers to cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reduced prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. As a result of the magnitude of our foreign sourcing, our business is subject to the following risks:\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability in countries or regions, especially Asia, including heightened terrorism and other security concerns, which could subject imported or exported goods to additional or more frequent inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods;\n\u2022\nimposition of regulations, quotas and other trade restrictions relating to imports, including quotas imposed by bilateral textile agreements between the U.S. and foreign countries;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rates;\n\u2022\nimposition of increased duties, taxes, tariffs (including, but not limited to, the current U.S. Administration's tariffs on products manufactured in China and China's retaliatory tariffs on certain products sourced from the U.S. as described below) and other charges on imports;\n\u2022\nlabor union strikes at ports through which our products enter the U.S.;\n\u2022\nlabor shortages in countries where contractors and suppliers are located;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds to or from foreign countries;\n\u2022\ndisease epidemics and health-related concerns, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which could result in travel restrictions, closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;\n\u2022\nthe migration and development of manufacturing contractors, which could affect where our products are or are planned to be produced;\n\u2022\nincreases in the costs of fuel, travel and transportation;\n\u2022\nreduced manufacturing flexibility because of geographic distance between our foreign manufacturers and us, increasing the risk that we may have to mark down unsold inventory as a result of misjudging the market for a foreign-made product; and\n\u2022\nviolations by foreign contractors of labor and wage standards and resulting adverse publicity.\nTo date, the current U.S. Administration has imposed, and continues to propose to impose, additional tariffs to all imports from China, which tariff lines include products we manufacture. We continue to evaluate the known and potential impact of these effective and proposed tariffs and any other recent changes in foreign trade policy, including any retaliatory tariffs and other international trade agreements and policies, on our supply chain, costs, sales and profitability. While we have implemented certain strategies to mitigate such impact, including accelerating shipments, reviewing sourcing options, working with our suppliers and strategically increasing prices of some of our product and continue to evaluate mitigation options as necessary, any recently enacted, proposed and future tariffs on products imported by us from China could significantly increase our production costs and negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nIf these risks limit or prevent us from manufacturing products in any significant international market, prevent us from acquiring products from foreign suppliers, or significantly increase the cost of our products, our operations could be seriously disrupted until alternative suppliers are found or alternative markets are developed, which could negatively and significantly impact our business. While we may be able to shift our sourcing options to avoid any negative macroenvironmental impact of a particular region such as China, executing such a shift would be time consuming and would be difficult or impracticable for many products and may result in an increase in our manufacturing costs and/or may negatively impact the quality of our products. Any increase in the prices of our products and/or decline in the quality of our products could in turn negatively impact the demand for our products.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could cause delays and increase costs and cause our operating results and financial condition to suffer.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of the fabrics or other raw materials, particularly cotton, silk, leather and synthetics used in our manufactured apparel, could have a material adverse effect on cost of sales or our ability to meet customer demands. The prices of fabrics depend largely on the market prices of the raw materials used to produce them. The price and availability of the raw materials and, in turn, the fabrics used in our apparel may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, including crop yields, weather patterns, labor costs and changes in oil prices as well as other economic factors, such as those related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We may not be able to create suitable design solutions that utilize raw materials with attractive prices or, alternatively, to pass higher raw materials prices and related transportation costs on to our customers. We are not always successful in our efforts to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of raw materials, and our business can be materially affected by dramatic movements in prices of raw materials. The ultimate effect of this change on our earnings cannot be quantified, as the effect of movements in raw materials prices on industry selling prices are uncertain, but any significant increase in these prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur reliance on independent manufacturers could cause delays or quality issues which could damage customer relationships.\nWe use independent manufacturers to assemble or produce all of our products, whether inside or outside the U.S. We are dependent on the ability of these independent manufacturers to adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing capacity. Because we do not control these independent manufacturers, they may not continue to provide products that are consistent with our standards. We receive from time to time shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality control standards or products that are damaged during shipment as they were not properly packed. Failures such as these in our quality control program may result in diminished product quality, which in turn may result in increased order cancellations and returns, decreased consumer demand for our products, or product recalls, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, products that fail to meet our standards, or other unauthorized products, could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge. This could materially harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace.\nWe generally do not have long-term written agreements with any independent manufacturers. As a result, any single manufacturing contractor could unilaterally terminate its relationship with us at any time. Our top five manufacturers accounted for the production of approximately 50% of our finished products during fiscal 2019. Supply disruptions from these manufacturers (or any of our other manufacturers) could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demands, if we are unable to source suitable replacement materials at acceptable prices or at all. Moreover, alternative manufacturers, if available, may not be able to provide us with products or services of a comparable quality, at an acceptable price or on a timely basis. We may also, from time to time, make a decision to enter into a relationship with a new manufacturer. Identifying a suitable supplier is an involved process that requires us to become satisfied with their quality control, responsiveness and service, financial stability and labor and other ethical practices. There can be no assurance that there will not be a disruption in the supply of our products from independent manufacturers or that any new manufacturer will be successful in producing our products in a manner we expected, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which initially significantly impacted the regions many of these manufacturers are located. Moreover, during fiscal 2017, certain manufacturers demanded accelerated payment terms or prepayments as a condition to delivering finished goods to us, which required us to take various steps to address those requests to avoid disruptions in product deliveries and to return to normal terms. There can be no assurance that such demands would not recur in the future, particularly in light of economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the event of any disruption with a manufacturer, we may not be able to substitute suitable alternative manufacturers in a timely and cost-efficient manner. The failure of any independent manufacturer to perform or the loss of any independent manufacturer could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our independent manufacturers fail to use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations, our brand images could be harmed due to negative publicity.\nWe have established and currently maintain operating guidelines which promote ethical business practices such as fair wage practices, compliance with child labor laws and other local laws. While we monitor compliance with those guidelines, we do not control our independent manufacturers or their business practices. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee their compliance with our guidelines. A lack of demonstrated compliance could lead us to seek alternative suppliers, which could increase our costs and result in delayed delivery of our products, product shortages or other disruptions of our operations.\nViolation of labor or other laws by our independent manufacturers or the divergence of an independent manufacturer\u2019s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the U.S. or other markets in which we do business could also attract negative publicity for us and our brands. From time to time, our audit results have revealed a lack of compliance in certain respects, including with respect to local labor, safety, and environmental laws. Other fashion companies have faced criticism after highly publicized incidents or compliance issues have occurred or been exposed at factories producing their products. To the extent our manufacturers do not bring their operations into compliance with such laws or resolve material issues identified in any of our audit results, we may face similar criticism and negative publicity. This could diminish the value of our brand images and reduce demand for our merchandise. In addition, other fashion companies have encountered organized boycotts of their products in such situations. If we, or other companies in our industry, encounter similar problems in the future, it could harm our brand images, stock price and results of operations.\nMonitoring compliance by independent manufacturers is complicated by the fact that expectations of ethical business practices continually evolve, may be substantially more demanding than applicable legal requirements and are driven in part by legal developments and by diverse groups active in publicizing and organizing public responses to perceived ethical shortcomings. Accordingly, we cannot predict how such expectations might develop in the future and cannot be certain that our guidelines would satisfy all parties who are active in monitoring and publicizing perceived shortcomings in labor and other business practices worldwide.\nOur operating results may be subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenue and income from operations.\nThe apparel and fashion industry in which we operate is cyclical and, consequently, our revenues are affected by general economic conditions and the seasonal trends characteristic to the apparel and fashion industry. Purchases of apparel are sensitive to a number of factors that influence the level of consumer spending, including economic conditions and the level of disposable consumer\nincome, consumer debt, interest rates, consumer confidence as well as the impact from adverse weather conditions. In addition, fluctuations in the amount of sales in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting direct-to-consumer sales; as such, the financial results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the fiscal year. Any future seasonal or quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors to assess the longer-term profitability and strength of our business at any particular point, which could lead to increased volatility in our stock price.\nOur goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets could become further impaired, which may require us to take significant non-cash charges against earnings.\nIn accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 350 Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (\u201cASC 350\u201d), goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth fiscal quarter and in an interim period if a triggering event occurs. Determining the fair value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates and operating margins, discount rates and future market conditions, among others. We base our estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, the Acquired Businesses recorded impairment charges of $13,376 relating to goodwill and the tradename intangible assets. Furthermore, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is likely there will be goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recognized in the first fiscal quarter ended May 2, 2020. It is possible that our current estimates of future operating results could change adversely and impact the evaluation of the recoverability of the remaining carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets and that the effect of such changes could be material. There can be no assurances that we will not be required to record further charges in our financial statements which would negatively impact our results of operations during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined.\nWe are required to pay to the Pre-IPO Stockholders 85% of certain tax benefits and could be required to make substantial cash payments in which our stockholders will not participate.\nWe entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with the Pre-IPO Stockholders (as defined therein) in connection with the IPO and Restructuring Transactions which closed on November 27, 2013. Under the Tax Receivable Agreement, we will be obligated to pay to the Pre-IPO Stockholders an amount equal to 85% of the cash savings in federal, state and local income tax realized by us by virtue of our future use of the federal, state and local net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) held by us as of November 27, 2013, together with section 197 intangible deductions (collectively, the \u201cPre-IPO Tax Benefits\u201d). \u201cSection 197 intangible deductions\u201d means amortization deductions with respect to certain amortizable intangible assets which are held by us and our subsidiaries immediately after November 27, 2013. Cash tax savings generally will be computed by comparing our actual federal, state and local income tax liability to the amount of such taxes that we would have been required to pay had such Pre-IPO Tax Benefits not been available to us. Assuming the federal, state and local corporate income tax rates presently in effect which includes the impact of the TCJA, no material change in applicable tax law and no limitation on our ability to use the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), the estimated cash benefit of the full use of these Pre-IPO Tax Benefits as of February 1, 2020 would be approximately $41,057, of which 85%, or approximately $34,898 plus accrued interest, is potentially payable to the Pre-IPO Stockholders under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement. As of February 1, 2020, $2,320, plus accrued interest, is currently outstanding. Accordingly, the Tax Receivable Agreement could require us to make substantial cash payments.\nPayments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement will depend upon a number of factors, including the amount and timing of taxable income we generate in the future and any future limitations that may be imposed on our ability to use the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits, and estimating future taxable income is inherently uncertain and requires judgment. If we determine in the future that the estimate should be revised, we would be required to either recognize additional liability related to tax benefits expected to be utilized or derecognize liability relating to tax benefits no longer expected to be utilized, which could result in material modifications to our financial statements.\nAlthough we are not aware of any issue that would cause the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) to challenge any tax benefits arising under the Tax Receivable Agreement, the affiliates of Sun Capital will not reimburse us for any payments previously made if such benefits subsequently were disallowed, although the amount of any tax savings subsequently disallowed will reduce any future payment otherwise owed to the Pre-IPO Stockholders. For example, if our determinations regarding the applicability (or lack thereof) and amount of any limitations on the NOLs under Section 382 of the Code were to be successfully challenged by the IRS after payments relating to such NOLs had been made to the Pre-IPO Stockholders, we would not be reimbursed by the Pre-IPO Stockholders and our recovery would be limited to the extent of future payments (if any) otherwise remaining under the Tax Receivable Agreement. As a result, in such circumstances we could make payments to the Pre-IPO Stockholders under the Tax Receivable Agreement in excess of our actual cash tax savings.\nAt the effective date of the Tax Receivable Agreement, the liability recognized was accounted for in our financial statements as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. Subsequent changes in the Tax Receivable Agreement liability will be recorded through earnings. Even if the NOLs are available to us, the Tax Receivable Agreement will operate to transfer 85% of the benefit to the Pre-\nIPO Stockholders. Additionally, the payments we make to the Pre-IPO Stockholders under the Tax Receivable Agreement are not expected to give rise to any incidental tax benefits to us, such as deductions or an adjustment to the basis of our assets.\nFederal and state laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of NOL carry-forwards in the event of an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code. Under the rules, such an ownership change is generally any change in ownership of more than 50 percent of a company\u2019s stock within a rolling three-year period, as calculated in accordance with the rules. The rules generally operate by focusing on changes in ownership among stockholders considered by the rules as owning directly or indirectly 5% or more of the stock of the company and any change in ownership arising from new issuances of stock by the company.\nWhile we have performed an analysis under Section 382 of the Code that indicates the IPO and Restructuring Transactions would not constitute an ownership change, such technical guidelines are complex and subject to significant judgment and interpretation. With the IPO and the transactions related to the IPO including the Restructuring Transactions, we may trigger or have already triggered an \u201cownership change\u201d limitation. We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use the pre-change NOL carry-forwards (after giving effect to payments to be made to the Pre-IPO Stockholders under the Tax Receivable Agreement) to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our analysis to date under Section 382 of the Code indicates that the IPO Restructuring Transactions have not triggered an \u201cownership change\u201d limitation.\nIf we did not enter into the Tax Receivable Agreement, we would be entitled to realize the full economic benefit of the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits, to the extent allowed by federal, state and local law, including Section 382 of the Code. Subject to exceptions, the Tax Receivable Agreement is designed with the objective of causing our annual cash costs attributable to federal state and local income taxes (without regard to our continuing 15% interest in the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits) to be the same as we would have paid had we not had the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits available to offset our federal, state and local taxable income. As a result, we will not be entitled to the economic benefit of the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits that would have been available if the Tax Receivable Agreement were not in effect (except to the extent of our continuing 15% interest in the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits).\nIn certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to the Pre-IPO Stockholders may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits.\nUpon the election of an affiliate of Sun Capital to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement pursuant to a change in control (as defined in the Tax Receivable Agreement) or upon our election to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement early, all of our payment and other obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be accelerated and will become due and payable. Additionally, the Tax Receivable Agreement provides that in the event that we breach any of our material obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement by operation of law as a result of the rejection of the Tax Receivable Agreement in a case commenced under Title 11 of the United States Code (the \u201cBankruptcy Code\u201d) then all of our payment and other obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be accelerated and will become due and payable.\nIn the case of any such acceleration, we would be required to make an immediate payment equal to 85% of the present value of the tax savings represented by any portion of the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits for which payment under the Tax Receivable Agreement has not already been made, which upfront payment may be made years in advance of the actual realization of such future benefits. Such payments could be substantial and could exceed our actual cash tax savings from the Pre-IPO Tax Benefits. In these situations, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash available or that we will be able to finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nIf we were to elect to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement, based on a discount rate equal to monthly LIBOR plus 200 basis points, we estimate that as of February 1, 2020 we would be required to pay approximately $1,804 in the aggregate under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nWe could incur significant costs in complying with environmental, health and safety laws or as a result of satisfying any liability or obligation imposed under such laws.\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. We could be held liable for the costs to address contamination of any real property ever owned, operated, or used as a disposal site. In addition, in the event that Kellwood becomes financially incapable of addressing the environmental liability incurred prior to the structural reorganization separating Kellwood from Vince Holding Corp. that occurred on November 27, 2013, a third party may file suit and attempt to allege that Kellwood and Vince Holding Corp. engaged in a fraudulent transfer by arguing that the purpose of the separation of the non-Vince assets from Vince Holding Corp. was to insulate our assets from the environmental liability. For example, pursuant to a Consent Decree with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) and the State of Missouri, a non-Vince subsidiary, which was separated from us in the Restructuring Transactions, is conducting a cleanup of contamination at the site of a plant in New Haven, Missouri, which occurred between 1973 and 1985. Kellwood has posted a letter of credit in the amount of\napproximately $5,900 as a performance guarantee for the estimated cost of the required remediation work. In connection with the Kellwood Sale, the letter of credit was transferred to the account of the Kellwood Purchaser. If, despite the financial assurance provided by the letter of credit as required by the EPA, the buyer of Kellwood became financially unable to address this remediation, and if the corporate separateness of Vince Holding Corp. is disregarded or if a fraudulent transfer is found to have occurred, we could be liable for the full amount of the remediation. If this were to occur or if we were to become liable for other environmental liabilities or obligations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAny disputes that arise between us and St. Louis, LLC, or between us and Kellwood, which is now an unaffiliated entity, with respect to our past relationships, could materially harm our business operations.\nDisputes may arise between St. Louis, LLC and us with respect to any past transitional services provided under the Shared Services Agreement. In addition, disputes may arise between us and Kellwood, which is now an unaffiliated entity as a result of the Kellwood Sale, in a number of areas relating to our past relationships, including intellectual property and technology matters; information retention, labor, tax, employee benefit, indemnification and other matters arising from our separation from Kellwood.\nAny dispute relating to the Shared Services Agreement may not be addressed adequately as St. Louis, LLC is now an entity with no operations. In addition, we may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts with Kellwood and the resolution might be more difficult with an unaffiliated party due to, among other things, lack of historical knowledge and understanding of the nature of our past relationship with Kellwood. Any such dispute, if not resolved, could materially harm our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Structure and Ownership\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d controlled by investment funds advised by affiliates of Sun Capital, whose interests in our business may be different from yours.\nAffiliates of Sun Capital Partners, Inc. (\u201cSun Capital\u201d) owned approximately 73% of our outstanding common stock as of May 31, 2020. As such, affiliates of Sun Capital will, for the foreseeable future, have significant influence over our reporting and corporate management and affairs, and will be able to control virtually all matters requiring stockholder approval. For so long as affiliates of Sun Capital own 30% or more of our outstanding shares of common stock, Sun Cardinal, LLC, an affiliate of Sun Capital, will have the right to designate a majority of our board of directors. For so long as affiliates of Sun Capital have the right to designate a majority of our board of directors, the directors designated by affiliates of Sun Capital may constitute a majority of each committee of our board of directors, other than the Audit Committee, and the chairman of each of the committees, other than the Audit Committee, may be a director serving on such committee who is designated by affiliates of Sun Capital, provided that, at such time as we are not a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the NYSE corporate governance standards, our committee membership will comply with all applicable requirements of those standards and a majority of our board of directors will be \u201cindependent directors,\u201d as defined under the rules of the NYSE (subject to applicable phase-in rules).\nAs a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d the rules of the NYSE exempt us from the obligation to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that a majority of our board of directors consists of \u201cindependent directors,\u201d as defined under such rules, and that we have nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees that are each composed entirely of independent directors. These exemptions do not modify the requirement for a fully independent audit committee, which we have. Similarly, once we are no longer a \u201ccontrolled company,\u201d we must comply with the independent board committee requirements as they relate to the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees, which are permitted to be phased-in as follows: (1) one independent committee member on the date we cease to be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d; (2) a majority of independent committee members within 90 days of such date; and (3) all independent committee members within one year of such date. Additionally, we will have 12 months from the date we cease to be a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d to have a majority of independent directors on our board of directors.\nAffiliates of Sun Capital control actions to be taken by us, our board of directors and our stockholders, including amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and approval of significant corporate transactions, including mergers and sales of substantially all of our assets. The directors designated by affiliates of Sun Capital have the authority, subject to the terms of our indebtedness and the rules and regulations of the NYSE, to issue additional stock, implement stock repurchase programs, declare dividends and make other decisions. The NYSE independence standards are intended to ensure that directors who meet the independence standard are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the doctrine of \u201ccorporate opportunity\u201d does not apply against Sun Capital or its affiliates, or any of our directors who are associates of, or affiliated with, Sun Capital, in a manner that would prohibit them from investing in competing businesses or doing business with our partners or customers. It is possible that the interests of Sun Capital and its affiliates may in some circumstances conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders, including you. For example, Sun Capital may have different tax positions from other stockholders which could influence their decisions regarding whether and when we should dispose of assets, whether and when we should incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, especially in light of the existence of the Tax Receivable Agreement, and whether and when we should terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement and accelerate our obligations thereunder. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration tax\nor other considerations of Sun Capital and its affiliates even where no similar benefit would accrue to us. See \u201cTax Receivable Agreement\u201d under Note 14 \u201cRelated Party Transactions\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for additional information.\nWe are a holding company and we are dependent upon distributions from our subsidiaries to pay dividends, taxes, and other expenses.\nVince Holding Corp. is a holding company with no material assets other than its ownership of membership interests in Vince Intermediate Holding, LLC, a holding company that has no material assets other than its interest in Vince, LLC. Neither Vince Holding Corp. nor Vince Intermediate Holding, LLC have any independent means of generating revenue. To the extent that we need funds, for a cash dividend to holders of our common stock or otherwise, and Vince Intermediate Holding, LLC or Vince, LLC is restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or is otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nWe file consolidated income tax returns on behalf of Vince Holding Corp. and Vince Intermediate Holding, LLC. Most of our future tax obligations will likely be attributed to the operations of Vince, LLC. Accordingly, most of the payments against the Tax Receivable Agreement will be attributed to the operations of Vince, LLC. We intend to cause Vince, LLC to pay distributions or make funds available to us in an amount sufficient to allow us to pay our taxes and any payments due to the Pre-IPO stockholders under the Tax Receivable Agreement. If, as a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, we do not have sufficient funds to pay tax or other liabilities, we may have to borrow funds and thus our liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest at a default rate of one-year LIBOR plus 500 basis points until paid. See \u201cTax Receivable Agreement\u201d under Note 14 \u201cRelated Party Transactions\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for more information regarding the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nAnti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay and discourage takeover attempts that stockholders may consider to be favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our Company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nthe classification of our board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u2022\nthe authorization of the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend, or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u2022\nstockholder action can only be taken at a special or regular meeting and not by written consent following the time that Sun Capital and its affiliates cease to beneficially own a majority of our common stock;\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures for nominating candidates to our board of directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nremoval of directors only for cause following the time that Sun Capital and its affiliates cease to beneficially own a majority of our common stock;\n\u2022\nallowing Sun Cardinal to fill any vacancy on our board of directors for so long as affiliates of Sun Capital own 30% or more of our outstanding shares of common stock and thereafter, allowing only our board of directors to fill vacancies on our board of directors; and\n\u2022\nfollowing the time that Sun Capital and its affiliates cease to beneficially own a majority of our common stock, super-majority voting requirements to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation also contains a provision that provides us with protections similar to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and prevents us from engaging in a business combination, such as a merger, with a person or group who acquires at least 15% of our voting stock for a period of three years from the date such person became an interested stockholder, unless board or stockholder approval is obtained prior to acquisition. However, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that both Sun Capital and its affiliates and any persons to whom a Sun Capital affiliate sells its common stock will be deemed to have been approved by our board of directors.\nThese anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change of control of our Company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the sole and exclusive forum for any of the following: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and intend to avail ourselves of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d as defined in the Exchange Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201csmaller reporting companies,\u201d including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We intend to take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer a \u201csmaller reporting company.\u201d We will remain a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d until the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter is $250 million or more and annual revenue as of our most recently completed fiscal year is $100 million or more, or the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter is $700 million or more, regardless of annual revenue.", "PERMNO": 14296, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "VNCE"}
