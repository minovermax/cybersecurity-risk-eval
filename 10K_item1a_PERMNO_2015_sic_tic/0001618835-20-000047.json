{"cik": "1618835", "company": "Evofem Biosciences, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding whether to invest in our securities, you should carefully consider the risks described below together with the information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Annual Report) including our financial statements and the related notes appearing in the section entitled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d. If any of these risks occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be harmed. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment. There may be additional risks we do not presently know of or we currently believe are immaterial which could also impair our business and financial position.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Requirements\nWe must raise significant additional funds to finance our operations to remain a going concern. Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights.\nBased on our cash balance, recurring losses since inception and the inadequacy of existing capital resources to fund planned operations during the next 12 months, we will require significant additional funding to continue operations and to complete the development of Phexxi for the prevention of certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and we will be unable to initiate the Phase 2 trial of our BV product candidate until we raise additional funds. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be unable to commercialize Phexxi as a contraceptive if approved by FDA, continue development of Phexxi for prevention of certain STIs, may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all our development programs, planned commercialization strategies or cease operations entirely. To the extent we raise additional capital through the sale of equity, convertible debt or other securities convertible into equity, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these new securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect rights of our stockholders. Debt financing, if available at all, would likely involve agreements with covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, making additional product acquisitions or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through strategic collaborations, alternative non-dilutive financing, such as royalty-based financing, or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates or future revenue streams or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. Moreover, if we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may be forced to liquidate our assets and the values we receive for our assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in our financial statements.\nWe have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. We have incurred yearly losses since inception, including net losses of $80.0 million and $125.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $513.2 million. Negative cash flows from our operations are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Our utilization of cash has been and will continue to be highly dependent on our product development programs, particularly our programs for the development of our lead Multipurpose Vaginal pH Regulator (MVP-RTM) product candidate, Phexxi, for several potential indications. Our cash expenses will be highly dependent on the product development programs we choose to pursue, the progress of these product development programs, the results of our preclinical and clinical trials, the cost, timing and outcomes of regulatory decisions regarding potential approval for our product candidate or any future product candidates we may choose to develop, the terms and conditions of our contracts with service providers and license partners, and the rate of recruitment of patients in our clinical trials. In addition, the continuation of our clinical trials, and quite possibly our entire business, will depend on our financial resources at the time. Failure to raise capital as and when needed, on favorable terms or at all, would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our product candidates.\nWe have devoted substantially all our financial resources to the development of our product candidates, including conducting clinical trials and providing general and administrative support for our operations. To date, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and related-party funding. The amount of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of our future expenditures and our ability to obtain funding through equity or debt financings, strategic collaborations or grants. Biopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of risk.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future and our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:\n\u2022\nseek to obtain regulatory approval for Phexxi as a contraceptive;\n\u2022\ncontinue the clinical development of our MVP-R product candidates for the prevention of certain STIs;\n\u2022\nundertake the manufacturing of our product candidates or increase volumes manufactured by third parties;\n\u2022\nadvance our programs into larger, more expensive clinical trials;\n\u2022\ninitiate additional preclinical, clinical, or other trials for our product candidates or any product candidates we may choose to develop in the future;\n\u2022\nseek regulatory and marketing approvals and reimbursement for our product candidates or any product candidates we may choose to develop in the future;\n\u2022\nestablish a sales, marketing, and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products for which we may obtain marketing approval and market for ourselves;\n\u2022\ncontinue efforts to identify, assess, acquire, and/or develop other product candidates;\n\u2022\nmake milestone, royalty or other payments under third-party license agreements;\n\u2022\nseek to maintain, protect, and expand our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u2022\nseek to attract and retain skilled personnel; and\n\u2022\nexperience any delays or encounter issues with the development and regulatory approval of our product candidates such as safety issues, clinical trial accrual delays, longer follow-up for planned trials, additional major trials or supportive studies necessary to support marketing approval.\nFurther, the net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year, such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance. Due to the recurring losses, negative cash flows from operating activities since inception, and net working capital at December 31, 2019, the report of our independent registered public accountant on our financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 filed in this Annual Report included explanatory language describing the existence of substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. There have been no adjustments in the accompanying financial statements to reflect this uncertainty.\nWe have never generated any revenue from product sales and may never be profitable.\nWe have no products approved for commercialization and have never generated any material amount of revenue from product sales. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability, alone or with strategic collaborators, to successfully complete the development of, and obtain necessary regulatory and marketing approvals to commercialize one or more of our current or future product candidates. We do not anticipate generating revenue from product sales until the second half of 2020. Our ability to generate future revenue from product sales depends heavily on our success in many areas, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nobtaining regulatory and marketing approval of Phexxi for prevention of pregnancy and successfully developing one or more of our other product candidates;\n\u2022\nhiring and training a qualified sales force to execute on our commercialization strategy in the United States;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing one or more product candidates and establishing and maintaining supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties that are commercially feasible, meet regulatory requirements and meet our supply needs in sufficient quantities to meet market demand for our product candidates, if approved;\n\u2022\nmarketing, launching and commercializing product candidates for which we obtain regulatory and marketing approval, either directly or with a collaborator or distributor;\n\u2022\ngaining market acceptance of our product candidates as treatment options;\n\u2022\naddressing any competing products;\n\u2022\nprotecting, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets and know-how;\n\u2022\nnegotiating favorable terms in any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter;\n\u2022\nobtaining reimbursement or pricing for Phexxi and our other product candidates in amounts that support profitability; and\n\u2022\nattracting, hiring and retaining qualified personnel.\nEven if Phexxi or our other product candidates are approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with launching and commercializing any approved product candidate. We also will have to develop or acquire manufacturing capabilities or continue to contract with contract manufacturers for continued development and potential commercialization of our product candidates. If we are not able to generate revenue from the sale of any approved products, we may never become profitable.\nWe are heavily reliant on our ability to access funding through capital market transactions. Due to our small public float, limited operating history and lack of revenue, it may be difficult and expensive for us to raise additional funds.\nWe are heavily reliant on our ability to raise funds through the issuance of shares of our common stock or securities linked to our common stock. Our ability to raise these funds may be dependent on several factors, including the risk factors further described in this Annual Report. The stocks of small cap companies in the biotechnology sector similar to us tend to be highly volatile. Even if we expand our portfolio of products and product candidates, we may never successfully commercialize or monetize our current product candidates or any future product candidates we may seek to develop.\nAs a result, we may be unable to access funding through sales of our common stock or other equity-linked securities. Even if we are able to access funding, the cost of capital may be substantial. The terms of any funding we are able to obtain may not be favorable to us and may be highly dilutive to our stockholders.\nWe may be unable to access capital due to unfavorable market conditions or other market factors outside of our control. There can be no assurance we will be able to raise additional capital when needed. The failure to obtain additional capital when needed would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nTo date, our activities have been largely limited to staffing, business planning, raising capital, developing our MVP-R gel product candidates, identifying potential new product candidates and undertaking preclinical and clinical trials of our current product candidates. We have a limited operating history which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects. Biopharmaceutical product development is a highly speculative undertaking and involves a substantial degree of uncertainty. As a clinical-stage company, we have not yet demonstrated our ability to obtain regulatory approvals, generate significant revenue or conduct biopharmaceutical marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. In addition, given our limited operating history, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other known and unknown factors. Our likelihood of success must be evaluated in light of such challenges and variables associated with a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical product development company and we may not be successful in our commercialization efforts or may incur greater costs than expected, both of which would materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Related to the Development of Our Product Candidates\nOur success will depend heavily on whether we can obtain FDA approval for and then commercialize, our lead product candidate, Phexxi, for prevention of pregnancy. Failure to obtain approval for, or to successfully commercialize Phexxi for prevention of pregnancy would likely cause our business to fail.\nWe currently have a single platform technology, our MVP-R gel, from which we intend to create multiple product candidates. However, we will rely primarily on Phexxi for prevention of pregnancy for our commercial success. Our second Phase 3 clinical trial intended to demonstrate efficacy for prevention of pregnancy had its last patient exit the study on November 8, 2018. We released top-line results from this trial on December 17, 2018, and we resubmitted our NDA for Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy on November 25, 2019. While we believe our MVP-R gel product candidate may also be useful in other indications, currently our business depends almost entirely on the successful clinical development and regulatory approval of Phexxi for prevention of pregnancy, which may never occur. We have never received regulatory approval for any product. Even though we were able to successfully complete our clinical trial for Phexxi for prevention of pregnancy, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for Phexxi for prevention of pregnancy, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.\nOur inability to develop our MVP-R gel product candidates for additional indications could have an adverse effect on our business and our ability to successfully market Phexxi for prevention of pregnancy.\nWe believe Phexxi may also be useful in certain other indications. In August 2019, we completed a Phase 2b clinical trial designed to assess the product candidate for the prevention of urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection (chlamydia) in women and for the prevention of urogenital Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection (gonorrhea) in women. Top-line results from this clinical trial, reported in December 2019, demonstrated that the trial met both its primary and secondary endpoints, with a 50% relative risk reduction in chlamydia infection and a 78% relative risk reduction in gonorrhea infection compared to placebo. We do not know if we will successfully complete the clinical development of either of these product candidates. Even if we do complete such clinical development, there is no assurance we will obtain regulatory approval of Phexxi for the prevention of either chlamydia or gonorrhea. Such a failure could impede our ability to market Phexxi for prevention of pregnancy because all our product candidates are based on the same active ingredients and technology. Also, any failure to obtain regulatory approvals for additional indications will likely have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or our financial condition.\nIndemnity claims from lawsuits or damages against our clinical trial sites could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of Phexxi, and any other product candidates we may develop.\nIn connection with our clinical trials, our third-party investigators and clinical trial sites face inherent risk of liability exposure from patients enrolled in our clinical trials. We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our clinical trial sites obligating us to defend the sites against third party claims or reimburse the sites should they incur certain costs or liability in connection with our clinical trials.\nWe currently carry product liability insurance with policy limits we believe are customary for similarly situated companies and adequate to provide us with coverage for foreseeable risks. Although we maintain\nsuch insurance, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage.\nIf we or our clinical trial sites cannot successfully defend against these product liability or other health related claims, we may incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in decreased demand\nfor Phexxi and any other product candidates we may develop, injury to our reputation, negative media attention and the diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from our product development and commercialization efforts to address claim related matters.\nThe success of our business is also expected to depend in part upon our ability to identify, license, discover, develop or commercialize additional product candidates. Failure to identify additional product candidates would have a negative impact on our business and operations.\nAlthough a substantial amount of our effort will focus on the potential approval and commercialization of Phexxi for prevention of pregnancy and for the preventative of certain STIs, the success of our business is also expected to depend in part upon our ability to identify, license, discover, develop or commercialize additional product candidates. We are seeking to license, or otherwise obtain, product and technology rights to a variety of products and product candidates in the field of women\u2019s health, but there can be no assurance we will be able to do so, or do so on favorable terms. There are risks, uncertainties and costs associated with identifying, licensing and advancing product candidates through successful clinical development. We may focus our efforts and resources on potential programs or product candidates that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful. Our research programs or licensing efforts may fail to yield additional product candidates for clinical development and commercialization for a number of reasons, including but not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nour research or business development methodology or search criteria and process may be unsuccessful in identifying potential product candidates;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able or willing to assemble sufficient resources to acquire or discover additional product candidates;\n\u2022\nour product candidates may not succeed in preclinical or clinical testing;\n\u2022\nour potential product candidates may be shown to have harmful side effects or may have other characteristics that may make the products unmarketable or unlikely to receive marketing approval;\n\u2022\ncompetitors may develop alternatives that render our product candidates obsolete or less attractive;\n\u2022\nproduct candidates we develop may be covered by third parties\u2019 patents or other exclusive rights;\n\u2022\nthe market for a product candidate may change during our program such that a product may become unreasonable to continue to develop;\n\u2022\nresearch and development programs are quite costly, and we may be unable to obtain the financing and resources to do so;\n\u2022\na product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and\n\u2022\na product candidate may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients, the medical community or third-party payers.\nIf any of these events occur, we may be forced to abandon our development efforts for a program or programs, or we may not be able to identify, license, partner, discover, develop or commercialize additional product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, even if we were able to obtain the rights to additional product candidates, there can be no assurance these candidates will ever be advanced successfully through clinical development.\nClinical trials are costly, time consuming and inherently risky, and we may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.\nClinical development is expensive, time consuming and involves significant risk. We cannot guarantee any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. In addition, certain of our product candidates are targeted toward the prevention of sexually transmitted infections. Therefore, it may be especially difficult to recruit patients to participate in our clinical trials when doing so will require patients to refrain from other methods of disease prevention. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of development. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ninability to obtain the funding necessary to initiate or complete any clinical trial;\n\u2022\ninability to generate satisfactory preclinical, toxicology or other in vivo or in vitro data or to develop diagnostics capable of supporting the initiation or continuation of clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with clinical research organizations (CROs) and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ndelays or failure in obtaining required institutional review board approval at each clinical trial site;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain or delays in obtaining a permit from regulatory authorities to conduct a clinical trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in recruiting or failure to recruit sufficient eligible patients in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nfailure to manufacture clinical trial scale quantities of our product candidate;\n\u2022\nfailure by clinical sites, CROs or other third parties to adhere to clinical trial requirements;\n\u2022\nfailure by clinical sites, CROs or other third parties to perform in accordance with the good clinical practices requirements of the FDA, applicable laws or applicable foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\npatients withdrawing from our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nadverse events or other issues of concern significant enough for an Institutional Review Board to suspend or terminate a clinical trial or for the FDA, or comparable foreign regulatory authority, to put an Investigational New Drug Application or comparable foreign application on clinical hold;\n\u2022\noccurrence of adverse events associated with our product candidates that may make it more difficult to recruit subjects or cause other material delays in the clinical programs;\n\u2022\nchanges in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols;\n\u2022\nthe cost of clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nnegative or inconclusive results from our clinical trials that may result in our deciding, or regulators requiring us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon development programs in other ongoing or planned indications for a product candidate; and\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with third-party manufacturers and the time for manufacture of sufficient quantities of our product candidates for use in clinical trials.\nAny inability to successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenue. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates, we may need to conduct additional non-clinical studies and/or clinical trials to show the results obtained from such new formulation or manufacturing process are consistent with previous results obtained. Clinical trial delays could also shorten any periods during which our products have patent protection and may allow competitors to develop and bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business and results of operations.\nDue in part to our limited financial resources, we may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable indications or therapeutic areas for our product candidates and we may be unable to pursue and complete the clinical trials we would like to pursue and complete.\nWe have limited financial and technical resources to determine the indications on which we should focus the development efforts for our product candidates and any future candidates we may choose to develop. Due to our limited available financial resources, we may be required to curtail clinical development programs and activities that might otherwise have led to more rapid progress of our product candidates, or product candidates we may in the future choose to develop, through the regulatory and development processes. We may make incorrect determinations regarding the indications and clinical trials on which to focus our available resources. The decisions to allocate our research, management and financial resources towards particular indications may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources from better opportunities. Similarly, our decisions to delay or terminate development programs may also cause us to miss valuable opportunities.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates\nWe must obtain regulatory approval prior to marketing or commercializing our product candidates. To obtain regulatory approval, we must complete our preclinical studies and clinical trials in compliance with the regulatory approval requirements of the FDA and any applicable and comparable foreign regulators. If our clinical trials fail to satisfactorily demonstrate safety and efficacy of our product candidates to the FDA and other comparable foreign regulators, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates. While we have received a Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designation for certain of our product candidates based on their current formulations, we may be required to reapply for this designation should we alter the formulations of these product candidates.\nWe are not permitted to commercialize, market, promote or sell any product candidate in the United States without obtaining marketing approval from the FDA. Comparable foreign regulatory authorities impose similar restrictions. We may never receive such approvals, and we must complete extensive preclinical development and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates before we may be able to obtain these approvals.\nAny inability to complete preclinical and clinical development successfully could result in additional costs to us and impair our ability to generate revenues. Moreover, if (1) we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other nonclinical testing of our product candidates beyond the trials and testing we currently contemplate, (2) we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, (3) the results of these clinical trials or tests are unfavorable, uncertain or are only modestly favorable or (4) there are unacceptable safety concerns associated with our product candidates, we may:\n\u2022\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nnot obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u2022\nobtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or significant safety warnings, including boxed warnings;\n\u2022\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing or other requirements; or\n\u2022\nbe required to remove the product from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nEven if we complete the necessary clinical trials, the marketing approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of our product candidates. If we are not able to obtain, or if there are delays in obtaining, required marketing approvals, we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nTo date, we have not received approval to market Phexxi or any other MVP-R product candidate for any indication from the FDA or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. We have limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to obtain marketing approvals for product candidates. Securing marketing approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the product candidate\u2019s safety and effectiveness. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities may determine that Phexxi or any potential future product candidate of ours is not effective, is only moderately effective or has undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities, safety profiles or other characteristics that preclude us from obtaining marketing approval or that prevent or limit commercial use.\nThe process of obtaining marketing approvals is expensive, may take many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application, may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical studies, clinical trials or other trials. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable. If we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of our product candidates, the commercial prospects for our product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired.\nOn November 25, 2019, we resubmitted our NDA that seeks approval from the FDA to market Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy. The Phexxi NDA resubmission included full results from the Phase 3 AMPOWER study, which was designed with guidance and input from the FDA to address the issues raised in the Complete Response Letter issued in April 2016. According to the FDA\u2019s classification, this application will be considered a Class 2 resubmission. The FDA has assigned a six-month review period with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of May 25, 2020.\nOn December 2, 2019 we reported top-line data for our AMPREVENCE clinical trial. These top-line data may differ from complete trial results once additional data are received and evaluated by the FDA.\nThe reported results of our AMPREVENCE clinical trial consist of only top-line data. Top-line data are based on a preliminary analysis of currently available efficacy and safety data, and therefore these results are subject to change, either by us or the FDA, following a comprehensive review of the more extensive data we expect to receive when the full data set becomes available. Top-line data are based on important assumptions, estimations, calculations and information currently available to us, and we have not received or had an opportunity to evaluate all of data from the AMPREVENCE trial. As a result, the top-line results may differ from the full data, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify these top-line results, once the complete data have been received and fully evaluated. If these initial data analyses differ from the results of the full AMPREVENCE data analyses, our ability to obtain or maintain approval for, and commercialize, Phexxi for prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea in women may be harmed, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and the value of our common stock.\nPhexxi is a drug/device combination and the process for obtaining regulatory approval for Phexxi in the United States will require compliance with requirements of two divisions of the FDA. A change in the FDA\u2019s primary oversight responsibility would adversely impact our development timeline and significantly raise our costs.\nPhexxi is composed of both drug and device components and is considered a combination product by the FDA. It is a method of self-applied contraception that uses a pre-filled applicator to apply a semi-solid bio-adhesive gel. The key active ingredient has been shown to be an active anti-inflammatory and anti-infective that works in combination with other active ingredients to stabilize the pH levels in the vagina without altering the vaginal microbiome, which results in both the inhibition and the immobilization of sperm. Other properties contributing to the birth control effect of Phexxi are its capacity to reduce/inhibit cervical mucus penetration, its ability to maintain sufficient viscosity even on dilution, and its bio-adhesive strength.\nThe FDA has different divisions responsible for assessing and approving devices and drugs. The Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) has responsibility for drug products, while the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) has oversight responsibility for medical devices. Phexxi previously underwent a request for designation process with the FDA that determined the CDER would lead the review and that the product should be submitted for marketing authorization\npursuant to an NDA. If the designation of the lead center were to be changed to CDRH, or if either division or the FDA Office of Combination Products were to institute additional requirements for the approval of Phexxi, we could be required to complete clinical trials with more patients and over longer periods of time than is currently anticipated or comply with regulatory requirements that are not currently anticipated. This would likely require us to raise additional funds and would cause us to miss anticipated timelines. The impact of either a change in lead agency center for pre-market review or the imposition of additional requirements for approval would be significant to us and would have a material adverse effect on the prospects for the development of Phexxi, our business and our financial condition.\nSerious adverse events arising post marketing or during clinical trials of our product candidates could have a material, adverse effect on our product development timeline or our ability to develop and market our MVP-R gel product candidates, including our lead product candidate, Phexxi.\nIf serious adverse events or undesirable side effects occur during the clinical investigation of our product candidates or post marketing, the following events could materially and adversely affect our business:\n\u2022\nIRBs may suspend or terminate our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may impose a clinical hold, which could result in substantial delays and adversely impact our ability to continue development of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of specific warnings or contraindications to product labeling or the issuance of alerts to physicians and pharmacies;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change the way the product candidates are administered or to revise the labeling of the product candidates;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to conduct additional clinical trials with more patients or over longer periods of time than anticipated;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to implement risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (REMS), which could result in substantial cost increases and have a negative impact on our ability to commercialize our product candidates;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to limit the patients who can receive our product candidates;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to promotional and marketing limitations on our product candidates;\n\u2022\nsales of approved products, if any, may decrease significantly;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require us to take approved products, if any, off the market;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of our product candidates, or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenues from our product candidates.\nIf FDA approval is received for our MVP-R gel product candidates, including Phexxi, or any other future product candidates we may develop, serious adverse events or side effects could require the product to be taken off the market, may require the product to be packaged with safety warnings or may otherwise limit our sales of the product.\nEven if we receive approval from the FDA in the United States to market our product candidates, we may fail to receive similar\napproval outside the United States.\nTo market a new product outside the United States, we must obtain separate marketing approvals in each jurisdiction and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries, including clinical trials, commercial sales, pricing manufacture distribution and safety requirements. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from, and be longer than, that required to obtain FDA approval. The marketing approval process in other countries may include all the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval in the United States, as well as other risks. Further, we may be unable to obtain rights to the necessary clinical data and may be required to generate our own. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, a new product must receive pricing and reimbursement approval prior to commercialization. This can result in substantial delays in these countries. Additionally, the product labeling requirements outside the United States may be different and inconsistent with the United States labeling requirements, negatively affecting our ability to market our products in\ncountries outside the United States.\nIn addition, if we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to fines, suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. In such an event, our ability to market to our full target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidate will be harmed, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur development and commercialization strategy for our product candidates depends, in part, on published scientific literature and the FDA\u2019s prior findings regarding the safety and efficacy of approved products based on data developed by others that the FDA may rely on in reviewing our NDA.\nThe Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (also known as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments) added section 505(b)(2) to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FDCA), as well as several other provisions. Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. The FDA interprets section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, for the purposes of approving an NDA, to permit the applicant to rely, in part, upon published literature or the FDA\u2019s previous findings of safety and efficacy for an approved product. The FDA may also require the applicant to perform additional clinical trials or measurements to support any deviation from the previously approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the section 505(b)(2) applicant. The FDA may require an applicant\u2019s product label to have all or some of the limitations, contraindications, warnings or precautions included in the reference product\u2019s label, including a black box warning, or may require the label to have additional limitations, contraindications, warnings or precautions.\nWe submitted an NDA for Phexxi in late 2019 under section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA that relies, in part, on the FDA\u2019s previous findings of safety and efficacy from investigations for approved products and published scientific literature for which we have not received a right of reference. We also plan to use the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway for future applications. We have made certifications against patents in the Orange Book covering reference products identified in the resubmission of our Phexxi NDA, which could result in patent litigation and delay of approval for our NDA.\nNotwithstanding the approval of many products by the FDA pursuant to section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, over the last few years some pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA\u2019s interpretation of section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. If the FDA changes its interpretation of section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, or if the FDA\u2019s interpretation is successfully challenged in court, this could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any section 505(b)(2) NDAs we submit in the future. Such a result could require us to conduct additional testing and costly clinical trials, which could substantially delay or prevent the approval and commercialization of our product candidates.\nRisks Related to Our Post-Marketing Legal and Regulatory Compliance\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, we will remain subject to ongoing regulatory requirements.\nIf our product candidates are approved, we will be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements with respect to manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record-keeping, conduct of post-marketing clinical trials and submission of safety, efficacy and other post-approval information, including both federal and state requirements in the United States and requirements of comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nManufacturers and manufacturers\u2019 facilities are required to continuously comply with FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authority requirements, including ensuring quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) regulations and corresponding foreign regulatory manufacturing requirements. Accordingly, we and our contract manufacturers will be subject to continual review and inspections to assess compliance with cGMP and adherence to commitments made in any NDA submission to the FDA or any other type of domestic or foreign marketing authorization application.\nAny regulatory approvals we receive for any of our product candidates may be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product candidate may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. We will be required to report adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Any new legislation addressing drug safety issues could result in delays in product development or commercialization, or increased costs to assure compliance. If our original marketing approval for a product candidate was obtained through an accelerated approval pathway, we could be required to conduct a successful post-marketing clinical trial to confirm the clinical benefit for our products. An unsuccessful post-marketing clinical trial or failure to complete such a trial could result in the withdrawal of marketing approval.\nIf a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or it disagrees with the promotion, marketing or labeling of a product, the regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or us, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency or enforcement authority may, among other things:\n\u2022\nissue warning letters;\n\u2022\nimpose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspend any of our ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications submitted by us;\n\u2022\nimpose restrictions on our operations, including closing our contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities; or\n\u2022\nrequire a product recall.\nAny government investigation of alleged violations of law would require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate adverse publicity. Any failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our products and the value of our business and our operating results would be adversely affected.\nDevelopments after a product reaches the market may adversely affect sales of our products.\nEven after regulatory approval, certain developments may decrease market demand for our products, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe re-review of products that are already marketed;\n\u2022\nnew scientific information and evolution of scientific theories;\n\u2022\nthe recall or loss of marketing approval of products that are already marketed;\n\u2022\nchanging government standards or public expectations regarding safety, efficacy or labeling changes; and\n\u2022\ngreater scrutiny in advertising and promotion.\nIn the past, clinical trials and post-marketing surveillance of certain marketed drugs have raised concerns that have led to recalls, withdrawals or adverse labeling of marketed products. If previously unknown side effects are discovered with one of the active ingredients in, or if there is an increase in negative publicity regarding known side effects related to any of our product candidates following its marketing approval, this could significantly reduce demand for the product or require us to take actions that could negatively affect sales, including removing the product from the market, restricting its distribution or applying for labeling changes.\nIn addition, certain health authorities, regulators and other governmental agencies have increased their focus on safety when assessing the balance of benefits and risks of drugs. Some health authorities appear to have become more cautious when making decisions about approvability of new products and are re-reviewing select products that are already marketed, adding further to the uncertainties in the regulatory processes post-approval. There is also greater regulatory scrutiny, especially in the United States, on the advertising and promotion (in particular, direct-to-consumer advertising and the use of influencers in\nadvertising campaigns), as well as the pricing and coverage, of prescription drug products.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure in conducting clinical trials and face similar risks with our current product candidates or other product candidates we may seek to develop or commercialize. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against these product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in decreased demand for our product candidates, or, injury to our reputation, negative media attention and the diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from our product development and commercialization efforts to address claim related matters.\nWe will need to maintain liability insurance coverage as we seek to conduct and continue to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates. Such insurance may become increasingly expensive and difficult to procure. In the future, such insurance may not be available to us at all or may only be available at a very high cost and, if available, may not be adequate to cover all liabilities we may incur. In addition, we will likely need to increase our liability insurance coverage in connection with the commercialization of our product candidates, if approved. If we are not able to obtain and maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise, our business could be harmed, possibly materially.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur research and development activities and our third-party manufacturer\u2019s and supplier\u2019s activities may involve the controlled storage, use, and disposal of hazardous materials, including the components of our product candidates and other hazardous compounds. We and our manufacturer and supplier, and our potential future manufacturers and suppliers, are and will be subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling, and disposal of these hazardous materials. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use may be stored at our and our current and potential future manufacturers\u2019 facilities pending their use and disposal. We cannot eliminate the risk of\ncontamination, which could cause an interruption of our commercialization efforts, research and development efforts and business operations; environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up; and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling, and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we believe the safety procedures utilized by us and our current third-party manufacturers for handling and disposing of materials generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee this is the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources and state or federal or other applicable authorities may curtail our use of specified materials and/or interrupt our business operations. Furthermore, environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and have tended to become more stringent. We cannot predict the impact of such changes and cannot be certain of our future compliance. We do not currently carry biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur rights to develop and commercialize our MVP-R gel product candidates, including our lead product candidate, Phexxi, are subject, in part, to the terms and conditions of licenses granted to us by third parties. The patent protection and patent prosecution of our MVP-R gel product candidates including our lead product candidate, Phexxi, for the prevention of pregnancy, is dependent on third parties.\nWe are reliant upon licenses to certain patent rights and proprietary technology from third parties that are important or necessary to the development of our MVP-R gel product candidates. For example, and as discussed in the section entitled \u201cBusiness\u201d of this Annual Report, our amended and restated license agreement with Rush University (the Rush License Agreement) includes intellectual property rights to our MVP-R gel product candidates, including Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy. This agreement requires us, as a condition to the maintenance of our license and other rights, to make milestone and royalty payments and satisfy certain performance obligations. Our obligations under this in-license agreement impose significant financial and logistical burdens upon our ability to carry out our business plan. Furthermore, if we do not meet such obligations in a timely manner, and, in the case of milestone payment requirements, if we were unable to obtain an extension of the deadlines for meeting such payment requirements, we could lose the rights to this proprietary technology, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is no assurance the existing Rush License Agreement covering the rights related to our MVP-R gel product candidates, including Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy, will not be terminated due to a material breach of the underlying agreement. This would include a failure on our part to make the milestone and royalty payments, our failure to obtain applicable approvals from governmental authorities, or the loss of rights to the underlying intellectual property by any such licensors. Under the current circumstances and as we have not paid royalties to date, the Rush License Agreement may be terminated at Rush University's option. While we believe we will be able to negotiate an extension, if needed, there is no assurance we will be able to renew or renegotiate an extension to the Rush License Agreement or that we will be able to do so on acceptable terms. The termination of this license agreement or our inability to enforce our rights under this license agreement would materially and adversely affect our ability to commercialize our MVP-R gel product candidates, including Phexxi.\nIn addition, with respect to our MVP-R gel product candidates, Rush University has the right, in certain instances, to control the defense against any infringement litigation arising from the manufacture or development (but not the sale) of our MVP-R gel product candidates. While our license agreement with Rush University requires Rush University to indemnify us for certain losses arising from these claims, this indemnification may not be sufficient to adequately compensate us for any related losses or the potential loss of our ability to manufacture and develop our MVP-R gel product candidates.\nFinally, the patent rights licensed to us under the Rush University License expire in 2021. If we are unable to obtain extensions of the patent rights, these patent rights will no longer protect our product candidates, and we will be relying solely on our directly owned patent formulas and patent application families for patent protection for our product candidates.\nIn general, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nOur licensors may have relied on third-party consultants or collaborators or on funds from third parties such that our licensors are not the sole and exclusive owners of the patents we in-license. If other third parties have ownership rights to our in-licensed patents, they may be able to license such patents to our competitors, and our competitors could market competing products and technology. This could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our product candidates, including our lead product candidate, Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy, and other proprietary technologies we may develop, or if the scope of the patent protection we have or will obtain is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products and technology similar or identical to our products and technology, and our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates, and other proprietary technologies we may develop may be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our product candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop. We seek to protect our proprietary position by in-licensing intellectual property and filing patent applications in the United States and abroad relating to Phexxi, our BV product candidate and other proprietary technologies we may develop. If we or our licensors are unable to obtain or maintain patent protection with respect to Phexxi, our BV product candidate and other proprietary technologies we may develop, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially harmed.\nChanges in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions, obtain, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property rights and, more generally, could affect the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our owned and licensed patents. With respect to both in-licensed and owned intellectual property, we cannot predict whether the patent applications we and our licensors are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient protection from competitors or other third parties.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive, time-consuming, and complex, and we may not be able to file, prosecute, maintain, enforce, or license all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output in time to obtain patent protection. Although we enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to confidential or patentable aspects of our research and development output, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, CROs, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors, and other third parties, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection. In addition, our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents depends on whether the differences between our inventions and the prior art allow our inventions to be patentable over the prior art. Furthermore, publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions claimed in any of our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we or our licensors were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions, and has been the subject of much litigation in recent years. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability, and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our owned or in-licensed pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our MVP-R gel product candidates and other product candidates or proprietary technologies that we may seek to develop or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and product candidates.\nMoreover, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Even if patent applications we license or own currently or in the future issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors or other third parties from competing with us, or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Any patents we own or in-license may be challenged, narrowed, circumvented, or invalidated by third parties. Consequently, we do not know whether our product candidates and other proprietary technology will be protectable or remain protected by valid and enforceable patents. Our competitors or other third parties may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity, or enforceability, and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. We or our licensors may be subject to a third-party preissuance submission of prior art to the USPTO, or become involved in opposition, derivation, revocation, reexamination, post-grant and inter partes review, or interference proceedings or other similar proceedings challenging our owned or licensed patent rights. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate or render unenforceable, our owned or in-licensed patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize generic versions of our product candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. Moreover, we, or one of our licensors, may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention or in post-grant challenge proceedings, such as oppositions in a foreign patent office, that challenge our or our licensor\u2019s priority of invention or other features of patentability with respect to our owned or in-licensed patents and patent applications. Such challenges may result in loss of patent rights, loss of exclusivity, or in patent claims being narrowed,\ninvalidated, or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our product candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop. Such proceedings also may result in substantial cost and require significant time from our scientists and management, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.\nIn addition, given the amount of time required for the development, testing, and regulatory review of our product candidates, patents protecting such product candidates might expire before or shortly after such product candidates are commercialized. As a result, our intellectual property may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. Moreover, some of our owned and in-licensed patents and patent applications are, and may in the future be, co-owned with third parties. If we are unable to obtain an exclusive license to any such third-party co-owners\u2019 interest in such patents or patent applications, such co-owners may be able to license their rights to other third parties, including our competitors, and our competitors could market competing products and technology. In addition, we may need the cooperation of any such co-owners of our patents in order to enforce such patents against third parties, and such cooperation may not be provided to us. Furthermore, our owned and in-licensed patents may be subject to a reservation of rights by one or more third parties. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting, and defending patents on our product candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technology in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceutical products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights generally. In addition, some jurisdictions, such as Europe, Japan, and China, may have a higher standard for patentability than in the United States, including for example the requirement of claims having literal support in the original patent filing and the limitation on using supporting data that is not in the original patent filing. Under those heightened patentability requirements, we may not be able to obtain sufficient patent protection in certain jurisdictions even though the same or similar patent protection can be secured in United States and other jurisdictions.\nProceedings to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that it initiates, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property we develop or license.\nMany countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If we or any of our licensors are forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects may be adversely affected.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment, and other requirements imposed by government patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees, and various other government fees on patents and applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various government patent agencies outside of the United States over the lifetime of our owned or licensed patents and applications. In certain circumstances, we rely on our licensing partners to pay these fees due to United States and non-United States patent agencies. The USPTO and various non-United States government agencies require compliance with several procedural, documentary, fee payment, and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We are also dependent on our licensors to take the necessary action to comply with these requirements with respect to our licensed intellectual property. In some cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by\nother means in accordance with the applicable rules. There are situations, however, in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in a partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, potential competitors might be able to enter the market with similar or identical products or technology, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nChanges in United States patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nChanges in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. Assuming other requirements for patentability are met, prior to March 2013, in the United States, the first to invent the claimed invention was entitled to the patent, while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application was entitled to the patent. After March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the America Invents Act) enacted in September 2011, the United States transitioned to a first inventor to file system in which, assuming other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether a third party was the first to invent the claimed invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after March 2013, but before we could therefore be awarded a patent covering an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by such third party. This will require us to be cognizant going forward of the time from invention to filing of a patent application. Since patent applications in the United States and most other countries are confidential for a period after filing or until issuance, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors were the first to either (i) file any patent application related to our product candidates, including Phexxi, and other proprietary technologies we may develop or (ii) invent any of the inventions claimed in our or our licensor\u2019s patents or patent applications.\nThe America Invents Act also includes a number of significant changes that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and also may affect patent litigation. These include allowing third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by USPTO administered post-grant proceedings, including post-grant review, inter partes review, and derivation proceedings. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in United States federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. Therefore, the America Invents Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our owned or in-licensed patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our owned or in-licensed issued patents, all which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIn addition, the patent positions of companies in the development and commercialization of biologics and pharmaceuticals are particularly uncertain. Recent United States Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. This combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the validity and enforceability of patents, once obtained. Depending on future actions by the United States Congress, the federal courts, and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could have a material adverse effect on our existing patent portfolio and our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property in the future.\nIssued patents covering our product candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad.\nIf we or one of our licensors initiated legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering our product candidates, including Phexxi, and other proprietary technologies we may develop, the defendant could counterclaim that such patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may raise claims challenging the validity or enforceability of our owned or in-licensed patents before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, interference proceedings, derivation proceedings, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings). Such proceedings could result in the revocation of, cancellation of, or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our product candidates, including Phexxi, and other proprietary technologies we may develop. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we or our licensing partners and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a third party were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the\npatent protection on our product candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf we do not obtain patent term extension (PTE) and data exclusivity for our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of any FDA marketing approval of any product candidate we may develop, one or more of our owned or in-licensed United States patents may be eligible for limited PTE under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Action of 1984 (the Hatch-Waxman Amendments). The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a PTE of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. A PTE cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent may be extended and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Similar patent term restoration provisions to compensate for commercialization delay caused by regulatory review are also available in certain foreign jurisdictions, such as in Europe under Supplemental Protection Certificate (SPC).\nAn important part of our patent strategy is reliant on our ability to obtain PTE on the patents licensed from Rush University, which currently expire in 2021. However, we may not be granted an extension, such as PTE for the United States patent and SPC for the European patents because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents, or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than our request. If we are unable to obtain PTE or the term of any such extension is shorter than what we request, our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially harmed.\nThe patent protection and patent prosecution for our product candidates are dependent on third parties.\nWhile we normally seek to obtain the right to control prosecution, maintenance and enforcement of the patents relating to our product candidates, there may be times when the filing and prosecution activities for patents relating to our product candidate are controlled by our licensors or collaboration partners. If any of our current or future licensing or collaboration partners fail to prosecute, maintain and enforce such patents and patent applications in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business, including by payment of all applicable fees for patents covering our product candidate, we could lose our rights to the intellectual property or our exclusivity with respect to those rights, our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidate may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products. In addition, even where we have the right to control patent prosecution of patents and patent applications we have licensed to and from third parties, we may still be adversely affected or prejudiced by actions or inactions of our licensees, our licensors and their counsel that took place prior to the date upon which we assumed control over patent prosecution.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship of our patents and other intellectual property.\nWe or our licensors may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our owned or in-licensed patents, trade secrets, or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. For example, we or our licensors may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or our or our licensor\u2019s ownership of our owned or in-licensed patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property. If we or our licensors fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, intellectual property that is important to our product candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patents for our product candidates, including Phexxi, and other proprietary technologies we may develop, we also rely on trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to protect our unpatented know-how, technology, and other proprietary information and to maintain our competitive position. With respect to our product candidates, we consider trade secrets and know-how to be one of our important sources of intellectual property. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. In particular, our trade secrets and know-how in connection with our product candidates and other proprietary technology we may develop over time may be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal articles describing the methodology, and the movement of personnel with scientific positions in academic and industry.\nWe seek to protect these trade secrets and other proprietary technology, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, CROs, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors, and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. We cannot guarantee we have entered into such agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or proprietary technology and processes. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, our competitive position would be materially and adversely harmed.\nWe may be subject to claims that third parties have an ownership interest in our trade secrets. For example, we may have disputes arise from conflicting obligations of our employees, consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging ownership of our trade secrets. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, it may lose valuable trade secret rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, trade secrets that are important to a product candidate and other proprietary technologies we may develop. Such an outcome could have a material adverse effect on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining necessary rights to any product candidate we may develop through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nWe currently have rights to intellectual property, covering our MVP-R gel product candidates. Other pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions may also have filed or are planning to file patent applications potentially relevant to our business. To avoid infringing these third-party patents, we may find it necessary or prudent to obtain licenses to such patents from such third-party intellectual property holders. However, we may be unable to secure such licenses or otherwise acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes, or other intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify as necessary for our MVP-R gel product candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop. The licensing or acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and several more established companies may pursue strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights we may consider attractive or necessary. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, capital resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow it to make an appropriate return on our investment or at all. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights or maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have, we may have to abandon development of the relevant program or product candidate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants, or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employers or claims asserting ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees, consultants and advisors are currently or were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or biopharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants, and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these individuals have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such individual\u2019s current or former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that it regards as its own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing, or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. Such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or other violation against us or our collaborators may prevent or delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop.\nThe contraceptive and/or anti-STIs market is competitive and dynamic. Due to the significant research and development activities that are taking place by several companies, including us and our competitors, in this field, the intellectual property landscape is in flux, and it may remain uncertain in the future. There may be significant intellectual property related litigation and proceedings, relating to our owned and in-licensed, and other third party, intellectual property and proprietary rights in the future.\nOur commercial success depends in part on our and our collaborators\u2019 ability to avoid infringing, misappropriating and otherwise violating the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. There is a substantial amount of complex litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries, as well as administrative proceedings for challenging patents, including interference, derivation and reexamination proceedings before the USPTO or oppositions and other comparable proceedings in foreign jurisdictions. As discussed above, recently, due to changes in United States law referred to as patent reform, new procedures including inter partes review and post-grant review have been implemented. As stated above, this reform adds uncertainty to the possibility of challenge to our patents in the future.\nNumerous United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we intend to commercialize Phexxi and in which we are developing other proprietary technologies. As the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidate may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights of others. We cannot assure you that our product candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop will not infringe existing or future patents owned by third parties. We may not be aware of patents that have already been issued and that a third party, for example, a competitor in the fields in which we are developing our product candidate, might assert are infringed by our current or future product candidates, including claims to compositions, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods of use or treatment that cover our product candidate. It is also possible that patents owned by third parties of which we are aware, but which we do not believe are relevant to our product candidates and other proprietary technologies we may develop, could be found to be infringed by our product candidate. In addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that our product candidate may infringe.\nThird parties may currently have patents or obtain patents in the future and may claim that use of our technology or the manufacture, use or sale of our product candidates infringes upon these patents. In the event a third party claims we infringed their patents or that we are otherwise employing their proprietary technology without authorization and initiates litigation against us, even if we believe such claims are without merit, a court of competent jurisdiction could hold that such patents are valid, enforceable and infringed by our technology or product candidate. In this case, the holders of such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize the applicable product candidate or technology unless we obtain a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or are finally determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. If we are unable to obtain a necessary license to a third-party patent on commercially reasonable terms, we may be unable to commercialize our product candidate or technology or such commercialization efforts may be significantly delayed, which could in turn significantly harm our business.\nDefense of infringement claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of management and other employee resources from our business, and may impact our reputation. In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be enjoined from further developing or commercializing our infringing products or technology. In addition, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties and/or redesign our infringing products or technology, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. In that event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize our product candidate or technology, which could harm our business significantly. Further, we cannot predict whether any required license would be available at all or whether we would be available on commercially reasonable terms. In the event we could not obtain a license, we may be unable to further develop our product candidate and commercialize our product and product candidate, if approved, which could harm our business significantly. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property. Ultimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter licenses on acceptable terms.\nEngaging in litigation defending us against third parties alleging infringement of patent and other intellectual property rights is very expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of litigation or administrative proceedings more effectively than we can because of greater financial resources. Patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation\nand continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could impair our ability to compete in the marketplace. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming, and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensing partners, or we may be required to defend against claims of infringement. In addition, our patents or the patents of our licensing partners also may become involved in inventorship, priority or validity disputes. To counter or defend against such claims can be expensive and time consuming. In an infringement proceeding, a court may decide a patent owned or in-licensed by us is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds our owned and in-licensed patents do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation proceeding could put one or more of our owned or in-licensed patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing, or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. During trademark registration proceedings, including those for Phexxi, we may receive rejections of our applications by the USPTO or in other foreign jurisdictions. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, it may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in the USPTO and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. Moreover, any name we have proposed to use with our product candidate in the United States must be approved by the FDA, regardless of whether we have registered it, or applied to register it, as a trademark. Similar requirements exist in Europe. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names. Furthermore, in many countries, owning and maintaining a trademark registration may not provide an adequate defense against a subsequent infringement claim asserted by the owner of a senior trademark.\nWe may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition among potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. At times, competitors or other third parties may adopt trade names or trademarks similar to ours, thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to market confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of our registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights related to trademarks, trade secrets, domain names, copyrights or other intellectual property may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022\nothers may be able to make products that are similar to our product candidate or utilize similar technology but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we license or may own;\n\u2022\nwe, or our current or future licensors or collaborators, might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we license or may own in the future;\n\u2022\nwe, or our current or future licensors or collaborators, might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our or their inventions;\n\u2022\nothers may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technology without infringing our owned or licensed intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nit is possible that our current or future pending owned or licensed patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u2022\nissued patents that we hold rights to may be held invalid or unenforceable, including as a result of legal challenges by our competitors or other third parties;\n\u2022\nour competitors or other third parties might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u2022\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u2022\nthe patents of others may harm our business; and\n\u2022\nwe may choose not to file a patent in order to maintain certain trade secrets or know-how, and a third party may subsequently file a patent covering such intellectual property.\nShould any of these events occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nRisks Related to Our Reliance on Third Parties\nOur success relies on third-party suppliers and one contract manufacturer. Any failure by these third parties, including failure to successfully perform and comply with regulatory requirements, could negatively impact our business and our ability to develop and market our product candidates, and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe have a small number of employees and no internal manufacturing capability. Our management does not expect to manufacture any products and expects to rely solely on third parties to manufacture our products, and as such we will be subject to inherent uncertainties related to product safety, availability and security. We currently have only one contract manufacturer, DPT Laboratories, Ltd. (\u201cDPT\u201d), who we entered into a supply and manufacturing agreement with in November 2019 (the \u201cManufacturing Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the Manufacturing Agreement, subject only to a supply failure, we are obligated to purchase all of our requirements with respect to Phexxi from DPT. The Manufacturing Agreement may be terminated by either party at any time upon the occurrence of either the material failure of the other party to comply with its material obligations pursuant to the contract, and such failure is not remedied within 60 days of written notice thereof, or written notice if any bankruptcy event has occurred with respect to the other party. If DPT does not perform as agreed or terminates our agreement, we will be required to replace them as our manufacturer, and we may be unable to do so on a timely basis, on similar terms or at all. Furthermore, we have only a single source of supply for some of the key raw materials and components of our MVP-R gel product candidates, and while we believe we would be able to obtain supplies through alternative sources if needed, alternate sources of supply may not be readily available.\nMoreover, we do not expect to control the manufacturing processes for the production of Phexxi, our any other product candidates we may seek to develop, which must be made in accordance with relevant regulations including, among other things, quality control, quality assurance, compliance with cGMP and the maintenance of records and documentation. In the future, it is possible that our suppliers or manufacturers may fail to comply with FDA regulations, the requirements of other regulatory bodies or our own requirements, any of which would result in suspension or prevention of commercialization and/or manufacturing of our products or product candidates, including Phexxi; suspension of ongoing research; disqualification of data or other enforcement actions such as product recall, injunctions, civil penalties or criminal prosecutions against us. Furthermore, we may be unable to replace any supplier or manufacturer with an alternate supplier or manufacturer on a\ncommercially reasonable or timely basis, or at all.\nIf we were to experience an unexpected loss of supply of, or if any supplier or manufacturer were unable to meet our demand for our product candidates, we could experience delays in research, planned clinical trials or commercialization. We might be unable to find alternative suppliers or manufacturers with FDA approval, of acceptable quality, and that are able to supply products/ingredients in the appropriate volumes and at an acceptable cost. The long transition periods necessary to switch manufacturers and suppliers would significantly delay our timelines, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, our reliance on DPT, and potential future third-party manufacturers, exposes us to the following additional risks:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to identify other manufacturers on acceptable terms or at all;\n\u2022\nour third-party manufacturers might be unable to timely formulate and manufacture our product or produce the quantity and quality required to meet our clinical and commercial needs, if any;\n\u2022\nDPT and potential future third-party manufacturers may not be able to execute our manufacturing procedures appropriately;\n\u2022\nour future third-party manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce, store and distribute our products;\n\u2022\nmanufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMPs and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards, and we do not have control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards;\n\u2022\nwe may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to any improvements made by our third-party manufacturers in the manufacturing process for our product candidates; and\n\u2022\nour third-party manufacturers could breach or terminate their agreements with us.\nEach of these risks could delay our clinical trials, the approval, if any of our product candidates by the FDA or the commercialization of our product candidates or could result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenue. In addition, we rely on third parties to perform release testing on our product candidates prior to delivery to patients. If these tests are not appropriately conducted and test data are not reliable, patients could be put at risk of serious harm, which could result in product liability suits.\nThe manufacture of medical products is complex and requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of medical products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up and validating initial production and absence of contamination. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product, quality assurance testing, operator error, shortages of qualified personnel, timely availability of raw materials, lot consistency, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. Furthermore, if contaminants are discovered in our supply of our product candidates or in the manufacturing facilities, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period to investigate and remedy the contamination. We cannot be assured that any stability or other issues relating to the manufacture of our product candidates will not occur in the future. Additionally, our manufacturers may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes or unstable political environments. If our manufacturers were to encounter any of these difficulties, or otherwise fail to comply with their contractual obligations, our ability to provide our product candidates to patients in clinical trials would be jeopardized and our ability to distribute any approved products would be harmed. Any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies, could delay the completion of clinical trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining clinical trial programs and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical trials at additional expense or terminate clinical trials completely. There is no assurance that our manufacturer will be successful in establishing a larger-scale commercial manufacturing process for Phexxi or other product candidates that achieves our objectives for manufacturing capacity and cost of goods. Even if we could otherwise obtain regulatory approval for any product candidate, there is no assurance that our manufacturers will be able to manufacture the approved product to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulatory authorities, to produce it in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the potential launch of the product or to meet potential future demand. Any delay or failure in the production of any approved products would impair our ability to commercialize and obtain revenue from these products. These circumstances would materially harm our business, results of operations, financial conditions and prospects.\nWe have no internal distribution capabilities and intend to engage third-party distributors for distribution of products outside the United States. Our inability to identify, or enter into an agreement with, any such third-party distributor, would likely have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nAlthough we currently plan to market and sell our lead product candidate, Phexxi, directly in the United States, we do intend to enter into distribution agreements with one or more distributors of Phexxi outside the United States. We currently have not entered into any such distribution agreement with any such distributor, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to enter into any such distribution agreement on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we were to enter into such a product distribution agreement, we would be subject to uncertainties related to such distribution services, including the quality of such distribution services. For example, distributors may not have the capacity to supply sufficient product if demand increases rapidly. Further, we would be dependent on the distributors to ensure that the distribution process accords with applicable foreign and United States regulations, which include, among other things, compliance with current good documentation practices, the maintenance of certain records, and compliance with other regulations, including, without limitation, the FCPA. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in significant remedial action, including enforcement action requiring distributors to implement physical changes or improvements to their facilities, suspension of distribution or recall product. Additionally, any failure by us to forecast demand for finished product, including Phexxi, and failure by us to ensure our distributors have appropriate capacity to distribute such quantities of finished product, could result in an interruption in the supply of certain products and a decline in sales of that product. If we grant any such third party distributor the right to manufacture any applicable product, we would also be subject to the risk factors set forth above with respect to third party manufacturing of our product for distribution outside of the United States. Further, third-party distributors may not perform as agreed or may terminate their agreements with us. Any significant problem that our distributors experience could delay or interrupt our sale of products in the applicable jurisdiction until the applicable distributor cures the problem or until we identify\nand negotiate an acceptable agreement with an alternative distributor, if one is available. Any failure or delay in distributing products would likely have a negative impact on our business and operations.\nWe rely and intend to rely on third parties for the execution of our development programs for our product candidates. Failure of these third parties to provide services of a suitable quality and within acceptable time frames may cause the delay or failure of our development programs.\nWe employ a business model that relies on the outsourcing of certain functions, tests and services to CROs, medical institutions and other specialist providers, including, without limitation, the conduct, management and monitoring of our ongoing and planned clinical trials. As a result, we rely on these third parties for, among other things, quality assurance, clinical monitoring, clinical data management and regulatory expertise. We also intend to engage a CRO for all future clinical trial requirements needed to file for regulatory approvals. There is no assurance that such organizations or individuals will be able to provide the functions, tests or services as agreed upon, or to the requisite quality. We will rely on the efforts of these organizations and individuals and could suffer significant delays in the development of our product or processes should they fail to perform as expected.\nThere is also no assurance that these third parties will not make errors in, or simply fail to be effective in, the design, management or retention of our data or data systems. Any failures by such third parties could lead to a loss of data, which in turn could lead to delays in clinical development and obtaining regulatory approval. Third parties may not pass FDA or other regulatory audits, which could delay or prohibit regulatory approval. In addition, the cost of such services could significantly increase over time. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, regulatory approval of our current or any future product candidates may be delayed, prevented or cost significantly more than expected, all which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.\nIf we fail to enter into or maintain strategic relationships or collaborations with respect to future product candidates, or if we are unable to realize the potential benefits from such collaborations, our business, financial condition, commercialization prospects and results of operation may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we are successful in identifying and in-licensing the rights to additional product candidates, our expected strategy with respect to the development of any such future product candidates is to supplement internal efforts with third-party collaborations. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Collaborations are complex and time-consuming arrangements to negotiate and document.\nOur success in entering into a definitive agreement for any collaboration will depend upon, among other things, our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design and outcomes of the clinical trials, the collaborator\u2019s history of regulatory compliance, the likelihood of approval by regulatory authorities, the potential market for the product, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such products to customers, the potential of competing products, the strength of the intellectual property and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative products or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on with one of our competitors and whether such collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our products or product candidates.\nAny potential collaboration agreement into which we might enter may call for licensing or cross-licensing of potentially blocking patents, know-how or other intellectual property. Due to the potential overlap of data, know-how and intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that one of our collaborators will not dispute our right to use, license or distribute such data, know-how or other intellectual property rights, and this may potentially lead to disputes, liability or termination of the collaboration.\nWe may also be restricted under existing and future collaboration agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with other potential collaborators and may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If that were to occur, we may have to curtail the development of a particular product, reduce or delay our development program, delay commercialization, reduce the scope of sales or marketing activities, or increase expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we will need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Absent sufficient funds, we may not be able to commercialize a product candidate. If we enter into a collaboration agreement regarding a product or product candidate, we could be subject to, among other things, the following risks, each of which may materially harm our business, commercialization prospects and financial condition:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that the collaborator devotes to the product development program;\n\u2022\nwe may experience financial difficulties and thus not commit sufficient financial resources to the product development program;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to relinquish important rights to the collaborator such as marketing, distribution and intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\na collaborator could move forward with a competing product developed either independently or in collaboration with third parties, including our competitors;\n\u2022\na collaborator could terminate the agreement (for convenience if permitted) for our breach; or\n\u2022\nbusiness combinations or significant changes in a collaborator\u2019s business strategy may adversely affect our willingness to complete our obligations under any arrangement.\nAs a result, a collaboration may not result in the successful development or commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe enter into various contracts in the normal course of our business in which we indemnify the other party to the contract. In the event we must perform under these indemnification provisions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the normal course of business, we periodically enter into academic, commercial, service, collaboration, licensing, consulting and other agreements that contain indemnification provisions. With respect to our academic and other research agreements, including the Rush License Agreement, we typically indemnify the institution and related parties from losses arising from claims relating to the products, processes or services made, used, sold or performed pursuant to the agreements for which we have secured licenses, and from claims arising from our or our sublicensees\u2019 exercise of rights under the agreement. With respect to collaboration agreements, we may have to indemnify our collaborators from any third-party product liability claims that could result from the production, use or consumption of the product, as well as for alleged infringements of any patent or other intellectual property right owned by a third party. With respect to consultants, we indemnify them from claims arising from performance of their services in accordance with legal and contractual requirements.\nIf our obligations under an indemnification provision exceed applicable insurance coverage or if we were denied insurance coverage, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Similarly, if we are relying on a collaborator to indemnify us and the collaborator is denied insurance coverage or the indemnification obligation exceeds the applicable insurance coverage, and if the collaborator does not have other assets available to indemnify us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Commercialization of Our Product Candidates\nIf we are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may be unable to generate any revenue.\nAlthough some of our employees may have marketed, commercialized and sold other pharmaceutical products, including contraceptives, in the past while employed at other companies, we have no experience selling and marketing our product candidates, and we currently have no marketing or sales organization. We expect to hire internal sales representatives to market and sell Phexxi for use as contraception, if approved; however, we have not yet identified or hired any such sales representatives at this time. To successfully commercialize any products that may result from our development programs, we will need to find one or more collaborators to commercialize our products or invest in and develop these capabilities, either on our own or with others, which would be expensive, difficult and time consuming. Any failure or delay in the timely development of our internal commercialization capabilities could adversely impact the potential for success of our products.\nIf commercialization collaborators do not commit sufficient resources to commercialize our future products and we are unable to develop the necessary marketing and sales capabilities on our own, we will be unable to generate sufficient product revenue to sustain or grow our business. We may be competing with companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations, particularly\nin the markets our product candidates are intended to address. Without appropriate capabilities, whether directly or through third-party collaborators, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.\nWe face competition from other medical device, biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe medical device, biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive. Significant competition among various contraceptive products already exists. Existing products have name recognition, are marketed by companies with established commercial infrastructures and are marketed with greater financial, technical and personnel resources than we have. To compete and gain market share, any new product will need to demonstrate advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability or safety. In addition, new products developed by others could emerge as competitors to Phexxi, if it is approved for our lead indication, the prevention of pregnancy. Such products could offer an alternative form of non-hormonal contraceptive that provides protection over longer periods of time. If we are not able to compete effectively against our current and future competitors, our business will not grow and our financial condition and operations will suffer.\nOur potential competitors include large, well-established pharmaceutical companies and specialty pharmaceutical companies. These companies include Merck & Co., Inc., Allergan PLC, Pfizer Inc., Bayer AG, Johnson & Johnson, CooperSurgical Inc. and Mylan Inc. Additionally, several generic manufacturers currently market and continue to introduce new generic contraceptives. There are other contraceptive product candidates in development that, if approved, would potentially compete with Phexxi, including hormonal patches and hormonal vaginal rings.\nOur product candidates, may not gain acceptance among physicians, patients or the medical community, thereby limiting our potential to generate revenue, which will undermine our future growth prospects.\nEven if our product candidates are approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the degree of market acceptance of any new product by physicians, health care professionals and third-party payers will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\ndemonstrated evidence of efficacy and safety;\n\u2022\nsufficient third-party insurance coverage and adequate reimbursement;\n\u2022\neffectiveness of our or our collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategy;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of consumers, without third-party insurance coverage and adequate reimbursement, to pay for the product;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of pharmacy chains to stock the products;\n\u2022\nthe prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects; and\n\u2022\navailability of alternative products.\nIf any product candidate that we may license, develop or sell, including Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy, does not provide a benefit over currently available options, that product candidate is unlikely to achieve market acceptance and we will not generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability.\nThe success of Phexxi or any future contraceptive product candidate we may seek to develop will depend on the availability of contraceptive alternatives and women\u2019s preferences, in addition to the market\u2019s acceptance of our new form of prevention of pregnancy.\nThe commercial success of Phexxi or any other future contraceptive product candidate we may seek to develop will depend upon the contraceptive market as well as market acceptance of our new form of prevention of pregnancy. Risks related to market acceptance include, among other things:\n\u2022\nminimum acceptable contraceptive efficacy rates;\n\u2022\nperceived safety differences of hormonal and/or non-hormonal contraceptive options;\n\u2022\nchanges in healthcare laws and regulations, including implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively the ACA) and its effect on pharmaceutical coverage, reimbursement and pricing, and the coverage of preventable services (including contraception under certain conditions) and future new executive orders, legislation or agency rulemaking;\n\u2022\ncompetition from new lower dose hormonal contraceptives with more favorable side effect profiles; and\n\u2022\nnew generic contraceptive options including the possibility of a future potential generic version of Phexxi as a contraceptive (if it is approved for marketing by the FDA).\nThe occurrence of one or more of these risks could reduce the market potential for Phexxi or any future contraceptive product we may seek to develop, and place pressure on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe commercial success of our product candidates will depend in significant measure on the label claims that the FDA or other regulatory authorities approve for the product.\nThe commercial success of our product candidates will depend in significant measure upon our ability to obtain approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities of labeling describing a product candidate\u2019s expected features or benefits. Failure to achieve approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities of product labeling containing certain types of information on features or benefits will prevent or substantially limit our advertising and promotion of such features in order to differentiate our product candidates from those products already existing in the market. This failure would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe will need to obtain FDA approval of any proposed product names, and any failure or delay associated with such approval\nmay adversely affect our business.\nWe have received conditional approval from the FDA for the use of Phexxi as the proprietary name for our product candidate for the prevention of pregnancy, L-lactic acid, citric acid, and potassium bitartrate. However, this approval is conditional upon a further and final review by the FDA at the time of NDA approval. Additionally, any name we intend to use for our other current or future product candidates will require approval from the FDA regardless of whether we have secured a formal trademark registration from the USPTO. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product names, including an evaluation of the potential for confusion with other product names. The FDA may also object to a product name if it believes\nthe name inappropriately implies medical claims or contributes to an overstatement of efficacy. If the FDA objects to any of our proposed product names, we may be required to adopt alternative names for our product candidates. If we adopt alternative names, we would lose any goodwill or brand recognition developed for the Phexxi mark as well as the benefit of our existing trademark applications for such product candidate and may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable product name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA. We may be unable to build a successful brand identity for a new trademark in a timely manner or at all, which would limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\nIf we suffer negative publicity concerning the safety or efficacy of our products in development, our reputation could be harmed and we may be forced to cease development of such products.\nIf concerns should arise about the actual or anticipated clinical outcomes regarding the safety of any of our product candidates, such concerns could adversely affect the market\u2019s perception of these candidates. Such concerns could lead to a decline in investors\u2019 expectations and a decline in the price of our common stock.\nWe rely, and expect to continue to rely, on market research conducted on our behalf to evaluate the potential commercial acceptance of Phexxi, our BV product candidate, and other future product candidates.\nWe have contracted with and expect to continue to contract with third parties to perform market research on our behalf. Based on the results of our market research to date, we believe that Phexxi, if approved, would be an attractive alternative to hormonal birth control to certain women. However, these research findings may not be indicative or predictive of actual or overall market acceptance and any future market research may not be indicative of the acceptance for another product candidate or future product candidates we may develop.\nThe proportion of the contraceptive market that is made up of generic products continues to increase, making introduction of a branded contraceptive difficult and expensive.\nThe proportion of the United States market that is made up of generic products has been increasing over time. This trend is consistent in the women\u2019s health segment, as well, where many of the most popular oral contraceptive pills (OCP) brands have experienced genericization. Currently, only two branded OCPs remain and both have a relatively low market share. Assuming this trend continues, it may be more challenging to introduce Phexxi, if approved by the FDA, or any future approved contraceptive product candidate we may develop, as a branded contraceptive, at a price that will maximize our revenue and profits. Also, there may be additional marketing costs to introduce Phexxi in order to overcome the trend towards generics and to gain access to reimbursement by payers. If we are unable to introduce Phexxi or any future approved product candidate at a price that is commensurate with that of current branded products, or we are unable to gain reimbursement from payers for Phexxi, or if patients are unwilling to pay any price differential between Phexxi and a generic contraceptive product, our revenues will be limited.\nRisks Related to Our Commercialization of Healthcare Products\nIf approved for commercial marketing in the United States, our lead product candidate Phexxi and our other product candidates may face generic competition sooner than anticipated.\nEven if we are successful in achieving regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate, it may face competition from generic products earlier or more aggressively than anticipated, depending upon how well our future products perform in the United States prescription drug market. In addition to creating the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved for marketing under the NDA provisions of the statute pursuant to abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs. An ANDA relies on the preclinical and clinical testing conducted for a previously approved reference listed drug (RLD), and must demonstrate to the FDA that the generic drug product is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug and also that it is \u201cbioequivalent\u201d to the RLD. The FDA is prohibited by statute from approving an ANDA when certain marketing or data exclusivity protections apply to the RLD.\nIf the FDA approves our resubmitted NDA for Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy, we expect that it will be designated by the agency as an RLD and that it will be eligible for three years of data exclusivity based on our submission of new clinical data essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period would block FDA from approving either a subsequent ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA that rely in whole or in part on the Evofem\u2019s protected clinical data. If we do not receive such designation, we will not receive this three year data exclusivity. Further, we cannot predict the interest of potential generic competitors in the future Phexxi market, whether someone will attempt to invalidate our period of exclusivity or otherwise force the FDA to take other actions, or how quickly others may seek to come to market with competing products after the three-year data exclusivity period ends. Future product candidates may also receive marketing exclusivity under the FDCA after approval that may similarly be subject to challenge or uncertainty.\nIf the FDA does not grant our products appropriate periods of data exclusivity before approving generic versions of our products, the sales of our products could be adversely affected.\nWith FDA approval of an NDA, the product covered by the application is specified as a \u201creference-listed drug\u201d in the FDA\u2019s publication, \u201cApproved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,\u201d or the Orange Book. Manufacturers may seek approval of generic versions of reference-listed drugs through submission of abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, in the United States. In support of an ANDA, a generic manufacturer need not conduct clinical trials. Rather, the applicant generally must show that its product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration and conditions of use or labeling as the reference-listed drug and that the generic version is bioequivalent to the reference-listed drug, meaning it is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent. Generic products may be significantly less costly to bring to market than a reference-listed drug and companies that produce generic products are generally able to offer them at lower prices. Thus, following the introduction of a generic drug, a significant percentage of the sales of any reference-listed drug may be typically lost to the generic product.\nThe FDA may not approve an ANDA for a generic product until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the reference listed drug has expired. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, provides a period of five years of non-patent exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity, or NCE. Specifically, in cases where such exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the product, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following approval of the reference-listed drug. The FDCA also provides a period of three years of new clinical investigation, or NCI, data exclusivity in connection with the approval of a supplemental indication for the product for which a clinical trial is essential for approval.\nIn the event that a generic manufacturer is somehow able to obtain FDA approval without adherence to these periods of data exclusivity, the competition that our approved products may face from generic versions could negatively impact our future revenue, profitability and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on our investments in those product candidates.\nIf we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act and similar legislation outside of the United States by extending the patent terms and obtaining marketing exclusivity for our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of Phexxi, our other product candidates or potential future product candidates, if any, one or more of our United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term restoration under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Hatch-Waxman). The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, we may not be granted an extension if, for example, we fail to apply within applicable deadlines, we fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or if we otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or restoration or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we will have the right to exclusively market our products will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially.\nChanges in healthcare laws and regulations may eliminate current requirements for health insurance plans to cover and reimburse FDA-cleared or FDA-approved contraceptive products without cost sharing, which could reduce demand for products such as Phexxi. Even if Phexxi is approved for commercialization, our management expects our success will be dependent on the willingness or ability of patients to pay out-of-pocket should they not be able to obtain third-party reimbursement or should such reimbursement be limited.\nWe cannot be certain that third-party reimbursement will be available for Phexxi if it is approved for the prevention of pregnancy in 2020, or if reimbursement is available, the amount of any such reimbursement. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and subsequent regulations enacted by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (the DHHS) require, under certain conditions, health plans to provide coverage for women\u2019s preventive care, including all forms of FDA-cleared or FDA-approved contraception, without imposing any cost sharing on the plan beneficiary. These regulations ensure that women who wish to use an approved form of contraception may request it from their doctors and their health insurance plan must cover all costs associated with such products, under certain conditions. However, the Trump administration and Congress are attempting to repeal or repeal and replace the ACA and corresponding regulations, as more fully described below, which could eliminate the requirement for health plans to cover women\u2019s preventive care without cost sharing. Even if the ACA is not repealed, the DHHS regulations to specifically enforce the preventive health coverage mandate could be repealed or modified under the Trump Administration, which in 2017 altered the mandate to allow certain employers and insurers to opt-out of birth control coverage for religious or moral reasons. We cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rule making or changes in the law. Any repeal or elimination of the preventive care coverage rules would mean that women seeking to use prescribed forms of contraceptives may have to pay some portion of the cost for such products out-of-pocket, which could deter some women from using prescription contraceptive products, such as Phexxi, at all. We expect that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower\nreimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that may be charged for Phexxi or any of our product candidates, if approved. Even if we obtain coverage for any approved products, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients are unlikely to use any products we may market unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of those products. As a result, we expect that our success, to some degree, will be dependent on the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket for Phexxi in the event that their third-party payer either does not cover and reimburse Phexxi or requires payment of a portion of Phexxi by the patient, thus increasing the patient\u2019s overall cost to use Phexxi. This could reduce market demand for Phexxi or any future product candidates we may seek to develop, if and when they receive FDA approval, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, and prospects\nIn the event we are successful in obtaining regulatory approval to market our STI product candidates in the United States, revenues may be adversely affected if the product fails to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payers in the United States.\nMarket acceptance and sales of any product candidates that we commercialize, even if approved by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these products will be available from third-party payers, including government health administration authorities, managed care organizations and private health insurers. Third-party payers decide which therapies they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Third-party payers in the United States often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any product candidates that we develop will be made on a payer-by-payer basis. One payer\u2019s determination to provide coverage for a drug does not assure that other payers will also provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for the drug. Additionally, a third-party payer\u2019s decision to provide coverage for a therapy does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved.\nThird-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for pharmaceutical and medical device products. The United States government and other third-party payers are increasingly limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and medical devices, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Coverage decisions can depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new drug products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. We may incur significant costs to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our future products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the necessary FDA marketing approvals. Third-party payer coverage may not be available to patients for Phexxi for the prevention of chlamydia and gonorrhea, or any future product we may seek to commercialize. If third-party payers do not provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for Phexxi or our other product candidates, if approved, healthcare providers may not prescribe them or patients may ask their healthcare providers to prescribe competing products with more favorable reimbursement.\nManaged care organizations and other private insurers frequently adopt their own payment or reimbursement reductions. Consolidation among managed care organizations has increased the negotiating power of these entities. Third-party payers increasingly employ formularies to control costs by negotiating discounted prices in exchange for formulary inclusion. Failure to obtain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement for Phexxi or any future product we may seek to commercialize, or obtaining such pricing or placement at unfavorable pricing levels, could materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.\nThe pharmaceutical and medical device industries are highly regulated and subject to various fraud and abuse, data privacy, transparency, and other healthcare laws, including, without limitation, the United States Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the United States Federal False Claims Act and the FCPA.\nHealthcare providers and third-party payers play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products and medical devices that are granted marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, third-party payers, customers and other organizations may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations in the United States. These regulations are complex, and even minor irregularities can potentially give rise to claims that a statute or prohibition has been violated. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, among others, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, False Statements Statute, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), the FDCA, the Physician Self-Referral Law (Stark Law), the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, transparency laws and regulations and analogous state and foreign laws and regulations.\nThe scope and enforcement of these laws and regulations is uncertain and subject to rapid change. Regulatory authorities might challenge our current or future activities under these laws. Any such challenge could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with these laws will involve substantial costs. Any investigation of us or the third parties with whom we contract, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time consuming. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to\nsignificant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, monetary fines, individual imprisonment, disgorgement of profits, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, debarment under the FDCA, additional reporting or oversight obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with the law, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nHealthcare legislative reform measures may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nAmong policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. In March 2010, Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 or collectively, the ACA, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the United States pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things: (i) mandated that preventative services which have strong scientific evidence of health benefits, including in some cases contraception, must be fully covered by certain private third-party payers when they are delivered by an in-network provider; (ii) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; (iii) established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs; (iv) expanded the availability of lower pricing under the 340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the program; (v) increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price; (vi) expanded the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability; (vii) established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (and 75%, commencing January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; (viii) created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and (ix) established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drugs.\nSome of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 repealed the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the BBA), among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of the ACA and its possible repeal or replacement on our business.\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws\nmay result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have an adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations.\nAdditionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices considering the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products.\nAny reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.\nWe may be subject to numerous and varying privacy and security laws, and our failure to comply could result in penalties and reputational damage.\nWe and our third party service providers are subject to laws and regulations covering data privacy and the protection of personal information including health information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues which may affect our business. In the United States, we and our third party service providers may be subject to state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protections laws which impose requirements for the collection, use, disclosure and transmission of personal information. Each of these laws are subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and our third party service providers. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to penalties or sanctions, including criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) or for aiding and abetting the violation of HIPAA.\nIn particular, California has implemented the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act that imposes restrictive requirements regulating the use and disclosure of health information and other personally identifiable information, and California has recently adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the CCPA) which will come into effect beginning in January 2020. The CCPA mirrors a number of the key provisions of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) described below. The CCPA establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches.\nNumerous other countries have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information as well. EU member states and other jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations.\nEffective May 25, 2018, the European Union implemented the GDPR which is a broad data protection framework that expanded the scope of EU data protection law to non-EU entities that process, or control the processing of, the personal information of EU subjects, including clinical trial data. The GDPR allows for the imposition of fines and/or corrective action on entities that improperly use or disclose the personal information of EU subjects, including through a data security breach. Accordingly, data security breaches experienced by us, our collaborators or contractors could lead to significant fines, required corrective action, loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property, or could lead to the public exposure of personally identifiable information (including sensitive personal information) of our employees, collaborators, clinical trial patients, and others. The GDPR imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU to the United States and provides an enforcement authority to impose large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater.\nOur business may be adversely affected by unfavorable macroeconomic conditions.\nVarious macroeconomic factors could adversely affect our business, our results of operations and our financial condition, including changes in inflation, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and overall economic conditions and uncertainties, including those resulting from political instability (including workforce uncertainty), trade disputes between nations and the current and future conditions in the global financial markets. For example, if inflation or other factors were to\nsignificantly increase our business costs, we may be unable to pass through price increases to patients. The cost of importing similar products from foreign markets may affect our sales in any domestic market.\nInterest rates and the ability to access credit markets could also adversely affect the ability of patients, payers and distributors to purchase, pay for and effectively distribute our product if, and when approved. Similarly, these macroeconomic factors could affect the ability of our current or potential future third-party manufacturers, sole source or single source suppliers, licensors or licensees to remain in business, or otherwise manufacture or supply our product candidate. Failure by any of them to remain in business could affect our ability to manufacture Phexxi or any of our future product candidates.\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nAs we mature and expand our sales and marketing infrastructure, we will need to expand the size of our organization. If we experience difficulties in managing this growth or fail to attract and retain management and other key personnel, we may be unable to successfully commercialize our products, develop any product candidates or otherwise implement our business plan.\nAs of February 28, 2020, we had a total of 53 employees, all of which are full-time employees, and used third-party consultants to assist with research and development activities, including regulatory filings and clinical trial operations and support, sales and marketing research and programs, as well as general and administrative activities. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies develop, we expect that we will expand the size of our employee base for managerial, operational, sales, marketing, financial, regulatory affairs and other resources. For example, we expect to hire internal sales representatives for the purpose of selling Phexxi for the prevention of pregnancy, if approved, in the United States. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees. In addition, management may have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities, which would lead to disruptions in our operations. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to retain adequate staffing levels to run our operations and/or to accomplish all the objectives that we otherwise would seek to accomplish, or that our staffing levels may turn out to be too robust for our actual business activity.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive pharmaceutical and medical device industries depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial and key personnel. We are highly dependent on our senior management, and the loss of the services of any members of our senior management team could impede, delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our product candidates, hurt our ability to raise additional funds and negatively impact our ability to implement our business plan. If we lose the services of any of these individuals, it might not be able to find suitable replacements on a timely basis or at all, and our business could be harmed as a result. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on the lives of these individuals.\nWe might not be able to attract or retain qualified management and other key personnel in the future due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, medical device, biopharmaceutical and other businesses, particularly in the San Diego area where we are headquartered. As a result, we may be required to expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment and retention efforts, including the grant of significant equity incentive awards which would be dilutive to stockholders. Many of the other companies within the contraceptive industry with whom we compete for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and longer histories in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. If we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives or if we are not able to effectively manage any future growth, we may experience constraints that will harm our ability to implement our business strategy and achieve our business objectives.\nOur current or future employees, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards.\nWe may become exposed to the risk of employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, suppliers, commercial partners or vendors engaging in fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, suppliers, commercial partners and vendors could include intentional conduct such as failures: (i) to comply with FDA or other regulators\u2019 regulations, (ii) to provide accurate information to such regulators or (iii) to comply with manufacturing standards established by us and/or required by law. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws, regulations and industry guidance intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Misconduct by current or future employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, suppliers, commercial partners and vendors could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory or civil sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, suppliers, commercial partners and vendors, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses, or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us,\nand we are not successful in defending or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant adverse impact on our business and we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, monetary fines, individual imprisonment, disgorgement of profits, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, additional reporting or oversight obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with the law, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations.\nWe may be vulnerable to disruption, damage and financial obligations as a result of information technology system failures, security breaches, loss of data or other disruptions that could compromise our proprietary information or other sensitive information.\nDespite the implementation of security measures and internal policies and controls, any of the internal computer systems belonging to us or our third-party service providers are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, malicious attack, and telecommunication and electrical failure. Any system failure, accident, security breach or data breach that causes interruptions in our own or in third-party service vendors\u2019 operations could result in a material disruption of our product development programs. For example, the loss of clinical study data from future clinical trials could result in delays in our or our partners\u2019 regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the lost data. Further, our information technology and other internal infrastructure systems, including firewalls, servers, leased lines and connection to the Internet, face the risk of systemic failure, which could disrupt our operations. To the extent any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data or applications, sensitive information or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we may incur resulting liability and reputation damage, our product development programs and competitive position may be adversely affected and the further development of our products may be delayed. Furthermore, we may incur additional costs to remedy the damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches.\nWe expect to continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management will be required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.\nAs a public company, we incur and expect to continue to incur additional significant legal, accounting and other expenses in relation to our status as a public reporting company. We expect that these expenses will further increase after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may need to hire additional accounting, finance and other personnel in connection with our continuing efforts to comply with the requirements of being a public company, and our management and other personnel will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time towards maintaining compliance with these requirements. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Section 404), we will be required to furnish a report by our management on our internal controls over financial reporting, including an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. However, while we remain an emerging growth company in 2019, we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. If we identify one or more material weaknesses, this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.\nAny inability to attract and retain qualified key management personnel would impair our ability to implement our business plan.\nOur success largely depends on the continued service of key management, advisors and other specialized personnel, including Saundra Pelletier, our Chief Executive Officer, Justin J. File, our Chief Financial Officer, Kelly Culwell, M.D., our Chief Medical Officer and Russell Barrans, our Chief Commercial Officer who are all employed at will and for whom we do not have \u201ckey man\u201d insurance coverage. The loss of one or more members of our management team or other key employees or advisors could delay our commercialization efforts and research and development programs and could also have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain other highly qualified management personnel, as well as personnel with expertise in women\u2019s healthcare, drug development, governmental regulation and commercialization. We face competition for personnel from other companies, universities, public and private research institutions, government entities and other organizations (many of whom have substantially greater financial resources than us), and we might not be able to attract or\nretain these key employees on conditions that are economically acceptable. Our inability to attract and retain these key employees could prevent us from achieving our objectives and implementing our business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nWe are subject to United States and certain foreign export and import controls, sanctions, embargoes, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Compliance with these legal standards could impair our ability to compete in domestic and international markets. We can face criminal liability and other serious consequences for violations which can harm our business.\nWe are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the United States Export Administration Regulations, United States Customs regulations, various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the United States Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls, the FCPA, the United States domestic bribery statute contained in 18 United States C. \u00a7 201, the United States Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and other state and national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, contractors, and other partners from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything else of value to recipients in the public or private sector. We may engage third parties for clinical trials outside of the United States, to sell our products abroad once we enter a commercialization phase, and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations, and other regulatory approvals. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities, and other organizations. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, agents, contractors, and other partners, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. Any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nWe expect the price of our common stock may be volatile and may fluctuate substantially.\nThe stock market in general and the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to companies operating performance. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license product candidates or products, if any;\n\u2022\nthe results of our efforts to commercialize any product candidates, if approved;\n\u2022\nfailure or discontinuation of any of our research programs;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated results from, and any delays in, any future clinical trials, as well as results of regulatory reviews relating to the approval of any product candidates we may choose to develop;\n\u2022\nthe level of expenses related to any product candidates that we may choose to develop or clinical development programs we may choose to pursue;\n\u2022\ncommencement or termination of any collaboration or licensing arrangement;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technology;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures and capital commitments;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u2022\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nnew products, product candidates or new uses for existing products introduced or announced by our competitors, and the timing of these introductions or announcements;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical trials of product candidates of our competitors;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions and other factors that may be unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors, including changes in market valuations of similar companies, wars, terrorism\nand political unrest, outbreak of disease (e.g. novel coronavirus epidemic in China), boycotts and other business restrictions;\n\u2022\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022\nconditions or trends in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in earnings estimates, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nannouncement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by us or our stockholders in the future, as well as the overall trading volume of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nother factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in companies\u2019 stock prices, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against such companies. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThree of our stockholders own a significant percentage of our issued and outstanding common stock and will be able to exercise significant influence over matters submitted to stockholders for approval.\nAs of February 28, 2020, funds affiliated with or discretionarily managed by Invesco Ltd., funds affiliated with or discretionarily managed by Woodford Investment Management, and PDL BioPharma, Inc. (PDL) hold approximately 23.8% 18.4%, and 26.9%, respectively, of our outstanding common stock. If each of these stockholders were to exercise all of the warrants to purchase our common stock held by such stockholders, then their ownership percentages would be 24.7%, 18.4% and 31.5%, respectively, of our outstanding common stock. We have entered into voting agreements with certain funds managed by Woodford Investment Management that the shares held by such holders in excess of 19.5% of our issued and outstanding common stock shall be voted in the same proportion as the shares voted by all other stockholders. Notwithstanding the voting agreements, if the funds managed by Woodford Investment Management, Invesco Ltd. and PDL were to choose to act together, they would be able to exert a significant degree of influence over matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition on terms that other stockholders may desire. For example, these entities, if they choose to act together, would be able to have significant influence on the election of directors, approval of any increase in the number of shares reserved under equity incentive plans, approval of new equity incentive plans, and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all our assets. For more information see the section entitled \u201cDescription of Capital Stock Voting Agreements\u201d of this Annual Report.\nIn addition, and per the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we are not subject to or governed by Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL), which prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d and we are able to enter into transactions with our principal stockholders. A concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of a company, could deprive its stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale of a company and may materially adversely affect the market price of its common stock.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares of common stock may be sold into the public market at any point, which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur. These sales, or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. Outstanding shares of our common stock may be freely sold in the public market at any time to the extent permitted by Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act) or to the extent such shares have already been registered under the Securities Act and are held by non-affiliates.\nAs of December 31, 2019, there were 6,419,383 shares of our common stock subject to outstanding options, which have been registered on registration statements on Form S-8. Shares registered on a Form S-8 can be freely sold in the public market upon exercise, except to the extent they will be held by our affiliates, in which case such shares will become eligible for sale in the public market as permitted by Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2019, there were 5,305,377 shares subject to outstanding warrants to purchase our common stock, of which 849,056 were registered pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (No. 333-224958), which became effective on May 21, 2018, 1,666,667 were registered pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-231126), which became effective on May 7, 2019, and 2,777,779 were registered pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-232303), which became effective on July 2, 2019. Moreover, holders of 15,026,968 shares of our common stock, subject to conditions, may require us to file registration statements covering the resale of these shares or to include these shares in registration statements that we may file. In connection with these obligations, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-223731) which became effective on April 3, 2018.\nIn November 2019, the Company entered into an equity distribution agreement with Piper Sandler & Co. (Piper Sandler), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell shares of its common stock in at the market offerings (as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act) having an aggregate offering price up to $50 million in gross proceeds from time to time through Piper Sandler acting as sales agent. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we received proceeds of approximately $3.3 million (including $3.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $0.3 million in other receivable), net of commissions, from the sale of 515,019 shares of our common stock.\nWe were an emerging growth company, and are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d, and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe remained an emerging growth company until December 31, 2019 under the JOBS Act. We are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under SEC regulations. For periods when we were an emerging growth company, or for so long as we remain a\nsmaller reporting company, we will be permitted to and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies or smaller reporting companies. These exemptions include:\n\u2022\nfor so long as we are an emerging growth company, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nnot being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u2022\nreduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n\u2022\nexemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved for so long as we are an Emerging Growth Company.\nWe may choose to take advantage of some, but not all, of the available exemptions. Emerging growth companies may take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards, allowing emerging growth companies to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.\nWe cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock price may be more volatile.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future; capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain as a holder of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on shares of our common stock. We currently plan to retain all our future earnings, if any, and any cash received through future financings to finance the growth and development of our business. Accordingly, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be the sole source of gain for our common stockholders for the foreseeable future.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our bylaws or Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our bylaws or Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions might frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove the current management by making it more difficult for our stockholders to replace members of our board of directors. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u2022\nprohibiting our stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders or acting by written consent other than unanimous written consent;\n\u2022\npermitting our board of directors to issue additional shares of our preferred stock, with such rights, preferences and privileges as they may designate, including the right to approve an acquisition or other changes in control;\n\u2022\nestablishing an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022\nproviding that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n\u2022\nproviding that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; and\n\u2022\nrequiring the approval of our board of directors or the holders of a supermajority of our outstanding shares of capital stock to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\nClaims for indemnification by our directors and officers may reduce our available funds to satisfy successful third-party claims against us and may reduce the amount of money available to us.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws provides that we will indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.\nIn addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the DGCL, our amended and restated bylaws and our indemnification agreements that we have entered with our directors and officers provide that:\n\u2022\nWe will indemnify our directors and officers for serving us in those capacities, or for serving other business enterprises at our request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person\u2019s conduct was unlawful.\n\u2022\nWe may, in our discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law.\n\u2022\nWe are required to advance expenses, as incurred, to our directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such directors or officers shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.\n\u2022\nWe will not be obligated pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws to indemnify a person with respect to proceedings initiated by that person against us or our other indemnitees, except with respect to proceedings authorized by our board of directors or brought to enforce a right to indemnification.\n\u2022\nThe rights conferred in our amended and restated bylaws are not exclusive, and we are authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with our directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons.\n\u2022\nWe may not retroactively amend our bylaw provisions to reduce our indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees and agents.\nIf securities analysts cease publishing research or reports about our business, or if they publish negative evaluations of our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts covering our business downgrade their evaluations of our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline. In addition, if one or more of these analysts cease coverage or fail to regularly publish reports on our business, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our common stock price or trading volume to decline.", "PERMNO": 15075, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "EVFM"}
