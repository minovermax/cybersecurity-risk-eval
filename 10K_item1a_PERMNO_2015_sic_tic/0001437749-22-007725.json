If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements because of factors that are described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRisks Related to the Development of Our Product Candidates\nIf commercialization of AZSTARYS or any of our product candidates, if approved, are not successful, or we experience significant delays in commercialization, our business will be harmed.\nWe currently generate minimal commercial revenue from the sale of any prodrugs and we may never be able to successfully commercialize a prodrug product. For instance, we entered into the KP415 License Agreement with Commave pursuant to which we granted an exclusive, worldwide license to Commave to develop, manufacture and commercialize AZSTARYS and KP484 worldwide. We cannot guarantee that Commave will be able to successfully develop, manufacture or commercialize AZSTARYS or KP484 or that we will ever receive any future payments under the KP415 License Agreement.\nWe have invested substantially all our efforts and financial resources in the development of our proprietary LAT platform technology, the identification of potential product candidates and the development of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenue from AZSTARYS under the KP415 License Agreement and generate revenue from any of our product candidates will depend heavily on their successful development and eventual commercialization. The success of AZSTARYS and any of our product candidates will depend on several factors, including:\n\u25cf\nsuccessful completion of preclinical studies and requisite clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nsuccessful completion and achievement of endpoints in our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\ndemonstration that the risks involved with AZSTARYS and any of our product candidates are outweighed by the benefits;\n\u25cf\nsuccessful development of our manufacturing processes for AZSTARYS under the KP415 License Agreement and for any of our product candidates, including entering into and maintaining arrangements with third-party manufacturers;\n\u25cf\nsuccessful completion of an FDA preapproval inspection of the facilities used to manufacture any of our product candidates for which we may submit an NDA;\n\u25cf\nreceipt of timely marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities, including, if applicable, the determination by the DEA of the controlled substance schedule for a product candidate, taking into account the recommendation of the FDA;\n\u25cf\nobtaining differentiating claims in the labels for our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nobtaining and maintaining patent, trademark and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for AZSTARYS and any of our product candidates and otherwise protecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u25cf\nmaintaining compliance with regulatory requirements, including cGMPs;\n\u25cf\nlaunching commercial sales of AZSTARYS under the KP415 License Agreement and launching commercial sales of any of our product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with Commave or others;\n\u25cf\nacceptance of AZSTARYS and any of our product candidates, if approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u25cf\ncompeting effectively with other therapies;\n\u25cf\nobtaining and maintaining healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement; and\n\u25cf\nmaintaining a continued acceptable safety and efficacy profile of any of our products following approval.\nWhether regulatory approval will be granted is unpredictable and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. If, following submission, our NDA for a product candidate is not accepted for substantive review or approval, the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require that we conduct additional studies or clinical trials, provide additional data, take additional manufacturing steps or require other conditions before they will reconsider our application. If the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities require additional studies, clinical trials or data, we would incur increased costs and delays in the marketing approval process, which may require us to expend more resources than we have available. In addition, the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not consider sufficient any additional required studies, clinical trials, data or information that we perform and complete or generate, or we may decide to abandon the program.\nIt is possible that none of our product candidates in clinical development or any of our future product candidates will ever obtain regulatory approval, even if we expend substantial time and resources seeking such approval.\nIf we do not achieve one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays, Corium could experience an inability to successfully commercialize AZSTARYS or any of our product candidates covered by the KP415 License Agreement, if approved, or we could experience an inability to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates approved for marketing in the future, if any, which would harm our business.\nOur research and development activities are focused on discovering and developing proprietary prodrugs, and we are taking an innovative approach to discovering and developing prodrugs, which may never lead to marketable prodrug products.\nA key element of our strategy is to use our proprietary LAT platform technology to build a pipeline of prodrugs and progress product candidates based on these prodrugs through clinical development for the treatment of a variety of diseases and conditions. The scientific discoveries that form the basis for our efforts to discover and develop prodrugs are relatively new. As our scientific efforts are primarily focused on discovering novel prodrugs with new molecular structures, the evidence to support the feasibility of developing product candidates based on these discoveries is both preliminary and limited. Although our research and development efforts to date have resulted in a pipeline of prodrug product candidates, we may not be able to develop those product candidates into prodrugs that are bioequivalent, safe and/or effective or that offer commercially significant improvements over already approved drugs. Even if we are successful in continuing to build our pipeline, the potential product candidates that we identify may not be suitable for clinical development, for reasons including being shown to have harmful side effects, a lack of efficacy, or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be prodrugs that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance. If AZSTARYS is not successfully commercialized under our KP415 License Agreement and we do not successfully develop and commercialize any of our product candidates based upon our proprietary LAT platform technology, we will not be able to obtain product revenue in future periods, which likely would result in significant harm to our financial position and adversely affect our stock price.\nIf we are not able to obtain required regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates, or the approved labels are not sufficiently differentiated from other competing products, we will not be able to commercialize them and our ability to generate revenue or profits or to raise future capital could be limited.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, approval, sale, marketing, advertising and promotion, pricing, export, import and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries, which regulations differ from country to country and change over time. We are not permitted to market any of our product candidates in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA, or in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approvals in such countries. In the United States, the FDA generally requires the completion of non-clinical testing and clinical trials of each drug to establish its safety and efficacy and extensive pharmaceutical development to ensure its quality and other factors before an NDA is approved. Regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions impose similar requirements. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage result in the submission of an NDA to the FDA and even fewer are approved for commercialization.\nEven if regulatory approval is obtained, subsequent safety, efficacy, quality or other issues can result in a product approval being suspended or withdrawn, or the approved label for any approved product may not be sufficiently differentiated from other competing products to support market adoption thereof. In March 2021, the FDA approved the NDA for AZSTARYS, a once-daily product for the treatment of ADHD in patients ranging from six years and older. In February 2018, we announced that the FDA approved the NDA for APADAZ for the short-term (no more than 14 days) management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Even with the regulatory approval of AZSTARYS and APADAZ by the FDA, we cannot guarantee that the FDA will approve any of our product candidates for commercial sale or approve any proposed label we may have for any such product candidate. If our development efforts for our product candidates, including our efforts to obtain regulatory approval, are not successful for their planned indications or are delayed, or if adequate demand for our product candidates that are approved for marketing, if any, is not generated, our business will be harmed.\nThe success of our product candidates will depend on the receipt and maintenance of regulatory approval and the issuance and maintenance of such approval is uncertain and subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, institutional review boards, or IRBs, or ethics committees may disagree with the design or conduct of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nthe results of our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for marketing approval or for us to receive approval for claims that are necessary for commercialization;\n\u25cf\nthe dosing in a particular clinical trial may not be at an optimal level;\n\u25cf\npatients in our clinical trials may suffer adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nthe data collected from clinical trials may not be sufficient to support submissions to regulatory authorities or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u25cf\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies or may later suspend or withdraw such approval;\n\u25cf\nthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval; and\n\u25cf\neven if we obtain marketing approval in one or more countries, future safety or other issues could result in the suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval in such countries.\nWe have only limited experience in submitting the applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals and have relied, and expect to continue to rely, on consultants and third-party contract research organizations, or CROs, with expertise in this area to assist us in this process. Securing FDA approval requires the submission of extensive non-clinical and clinical data, information about product manufacturing processes and inspection of facilities and supporting information to the FDA for each therapeutic indication to establish a product candidate\u2019s safety and efficacy for each indication and manufacturing quality. Additionally, we cannot guarantee that regulators will agree with our assessment of the results of the clinical trials we have conducted or that any future trials will be successful.\nAny product candidates we develop may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use with respect to one or all intended indications.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory approvals is expensive, often takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon, among other things, the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved, the jurisdiction in which regulatory approval is sought and the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. Changes in the regulatory approval policy during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for a submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application or may result in future withdrawal of approval. Regulatory approval obtained in one jurisdiction does not necessarily mean that a product candidate will receive regulatory approval in all jurisdictions in which we may seek approval, but the failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may negatively impact our ability to seek approval in a different jurisdiction. Failure to obtain regulatory marketing approval of our product candidates in any indication will prevent us from commercializing those product candidates for that indication, and our ability to generate revenue will be impaired.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire, retain or deploy key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new or modified products from being developed, approved or commercialized in a timely manner or at all, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and or approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, statutory, regulatory, and policy changes, the FDA\u2019s ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and other events that may otherwise affect the FDA\u2019s ability to perform routine functions. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical FDA employees and stop critical activities.\nSeparately, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, the FDA announced its intention to postpone most inspections of foreign manufacturing facilities, and on March 18, 2020, the FDA temporarily postponed routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities. Subsequently, in July 2020, the FDA resumed certain on-site inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities subject to a risk-based prioritization system. The FDA utilized this risk-based assessment system to assist in determining when and where it was safest to conduct prioritized domestic inspections. Additionally, on April 15, 2021, the FDA issued a guidance document in which the FDA described its plans to conduct voluntary remote interactive evaluations of certain drug manufacturing facilities and clinical research sites, among other facilities. According to the guidance, the FDA may request such remote interactive evaluations where the FDA determines that remote evaluation would be appropriate based on mission needs and travel limitations. In May 2021, the FDA outlined a detailed plan to move toward a more consistent state of inspectional operations, and in July 2021, the FDA resumed standard inspectional operations of domestic facilities and was continuing to maintain this level of operation as of September 2021. More recently, the FDA has continued to monitor and implement changes to its inspectional activities to ensure the safety of its employees and those of the firms it regulates as it adapts to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. Regulatory authorities outside the United States may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf the FDA does not conclude that our product candidates satisfy the requirements for the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway as anticipated, the approval pathway for our product candidates will likely take significantly longer, cost significantly more and entail significantly greater complications and risks than anticipated, and the FDA may not ultimately approve our product candidates.\nA key element of our strategy is to seek FDA approval for most of our product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA, otherwise known as the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway with any NDA submitted thereunder a 505(b)(2) NDA, where possible. The 505(b)(2) NDA pathway permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Section 505(b)(2), if applicable to us under the FFDCA, would allow an NDA we submit to the FDA to rely in part on data in the public domain or the FDA\u2019s prior conclusions regarding the safety and effectiveness of approved compounds, which could expedite the development program for our future product candidates by potentially decreasing the amount of nonclinical and/or clinical data that we would need to generate in order to obtain FDA approval. Such reliance is typically predicated on a showing of bioequivalence or comparable bioavailability to an approved drug. AZSTARYS was approved via the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway on March 2, 2021, and APADAZ was approved via the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway on February 23, 2018.\nIf the FDA does not allow us to pursue the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway as anticipated, or if we cannot demonstrate bioequivalence or comparable bioavailability of our product candidates to approved products, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials, provide additional data and information, and meet additional standards for regulatory approval. Moreover, even if the FDA does allow us to pursue the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway, depending on the product candidate, we may still need to conduct additional clinical trials, including clinical trials to assess product safety or efficacy. If this were to occur, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for our product candidates, and complications and risks associated with our product candidates, would likely substantially increase.\nMoreover, our inability to pursue the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway could result in new competitive products reaching the market more quickly than our product candidates, which could hurt our competitive position and our business prospects. Even if we are allowed to pursue the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway, we cannot assure you that our product candidates will receive the requisite approvals for commercialization on a timely basis, if at all. Other companies may achieve product approval of similar products before we do, which would delay our ability to obtain product approval, expose us to greater competition, and would require that we seek approval via alternative pathways.\nIn addition, notwithstanding the approval of several products by the FDA under Section 505(b)(2) over the last few years, pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged, the FDA may change its policies and practices with respect to Section 505(b)(2) regulatory approvals, which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any NDA that we submit under Section 505(b)(2). In addition, the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are subject to certain requirements designed to protect the patent rights of sponsors of previously approved drugs that are referenced in a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. These requirements may give rise to patent litigation and mandatory delays in approval of our NDAs for up to 30 months or longer depending on the outcome of any litigation. It is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products. If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of a new product. Even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition. In addition, even if we are able to utilize the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, there is no guarantee this would ultimately lead to streamlined product development or earlier approval.\nClinical drug development involves a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome. We may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nThe risk of failure for our product candidates is high. It is impossible to predict when or if any of our current product candidates will prove effective or safe in humans and will receive regulatory approval. Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidate, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. Interpretation of results from early, usually smaller, studies that suggest positive trends in some subjects, requires caution. Results from later stages of clinical trials enrolling more subjects may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy results or otherwise fail to be consistent with the results of earlier trials of the same product candidates. Later clinical trial results may not replicate earlier clinical trials for a variety of reasons, including differences in trial design, different trial endpoints, or lack of trial endpoints in exploratory studies, subject population, number of subjects, subject selection criteria, trial duration, drug dosage and formulation and lack of statistical power in the earlier studies. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their products.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, including:\n\u25cf\nregulators or IRBs may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial, conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site or amend clinical trial protocols as needed;\n\u25cf\nwe may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective trial sites and CROs;\n\u25cf\nclinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, including failure to demonstrate statistical significance in cases where that is required, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon prodrug development programs;\n\u25cf we may be unable to obtain sufficient or adequate supply or quality of product candidates or other materials necessary for use in clinical trials, or experience delays in sufficiently developing, characterizing or controlling a manufacturing process suitable for clinical trials;\n\u25cf we may experience delays in manufacturing, testing, releasing, validating or importing/exporting sufficient stable quantities of our product candidates for use in clinical trials or the inability to do any of the foregoing;\n\u25cf\nthe number of subjects required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u25cf\nour third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or trial protocols, or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u25cf\nregulators or IRBs may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u25cf\nthe cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate, including if we are not able to pursue the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway for approval of our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nwe will need to pay substantial application user fees, which we may not be able to afford;\n\u25cf\nwe may be required to transfer manufacturing processes to larger-scale facilities operated by a contract manufacturing organization, and we may experience delays or failures by our contract manufacturers to make any necessary changes to such manufacturing process;\n\u25cf\nwe may abandon our development program or programs based on the changing regulatory or commercial environment;\n\u25cf\nregulatory authorities may not agree with our trial design or implementation; and\n\u25cf\nour product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators, regulators or IRBs to suspend or terminate the trials.\nIf we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may:\n\u25cf\nbe delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nnot obtain marketing approval at all;\n\u25cf\nobtain approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;\n\u25cf\nobtain approval but without the claims necessary for us to successfully commercialize our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nobtain approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings;\n\u25cf\nbe subject to additional post-marketing testing, surveillance, or other requirements, such as REMS; or\n\u25cf\nhave the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval.\nIn addition, disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may increase the likelihood that we encounter such difficulties or delays in initiating, enrolling, conducting or completing our planned and ongoing clinical trials. Any inability to successfully initiate or complete clinical trials could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenue from product sales. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates, we may be required to or we may elect to conduct additional studies to bridge our modified product candidates to earlier versions. Clinical trial delays could also shorten any periods during which our products have patent protection and may allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may seriously harm our business.\nClinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA and other applicable regulatory authorities\u2019 legal requirements, regulations or guidelines, and are subject to oversight by these governmental agencies and Ethics Committees or IRBs at the medical institutions where the clinical trials are conducted. We could encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us, by the data safety monitoring board for such trial or by the FDA or any other regulatory authority, or if the IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted suspend or terminate the participation of their clinical investigators and sites subject to their review. Such authorities may suspend or terminate a clinical trial due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a product candidate, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial.\nFurther, conducting clinical trials in foreign countries, as we may do for our product candidates, presents additional risks that may delay completion of our clinical trials. These risks include the failure of enrolled patients in foreign countries to adhere to clinical protocol as a result of differences in healthcare services or cultural customs, managing additional administrative burdens associated with foreign regulatory schemes, as well as political and economic risks relevant to such foreign countries.\nMoreover, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive compensation in connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to report some of these relationships to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority may conclude that a financial relationship between us and a principal investigator has created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected interpretation of the study. The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection, of our marketing applications by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority, as the case may be, and may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of one or more of our product candidates.\nDelays in the completion of any clinical trial of our product candidates will increase our costs, slow down our product development and the regulatory approval processes and delay or potentially jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate product revenue. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nIf we experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of subjects in clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nWe may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for our product candidates if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible subjects to participate in these trials as may be required by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. We cannot predict how successful we will be at enrolling subjects in future clinical trials. If we are not successful at enrolling subjects in one clinical trial, it may affect when we are able to initiate our next clinical trial, which could result in significant delays in our efforts to pursue regulatory approval of and commercialize our product candidates. In addition, some of our competitors have ongoing clinical trials to treat the same indications as our product candidates, and subjects who would otherwise be eligible for our clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of our competitors. Subject enrollment is affected by other factors including:\n\u25cf the size and nature of the subject population specified in the trial protocol;\n\u25cf the eligibility criteria for the study in question;\n\u25cf the perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u25cf the fact that the product candidate is a controlled substance;\n\u25cf severe or unexpected drug-related adverse events experienced by subjects in a clinical trial;\n\u25cf the availability of drugs approved to treat the diseases or conditions under study;\n\u25cf the efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u25cf the patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u25cf the severity of the disease or condition under investigation;\n\u25cf the ability to obtain and maintain subject informed consent;\n\u25cf the ability to retain subjects in the clinical trial and their return for follow-up;\n\u25cf the clinical trial design, including required tests, procedures and follow-up;\n\u25cf the ability to monitor subjects adequately during and after treatment;\n\u25cf delays in adding new investigators and clinical sites;\n\u25cf withdrawal of clinical trial sites from clinical trials; and\n\u25cf the proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective subjects.\nOur inability to enroll a sufficient number of subjects for clinical trials would result in significant delays and could require us to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in these clinical trials may result in increased development costs for our product candidates, which could cause our value to decline and limit our ability to obtain additional financing.\nInterim, topline, or preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publicly disclose topline or preliminary data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations, and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the preliminary or topline results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data has been received and fully evaluated. Topline data also remains subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, preliminary or topline data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available.\nFrom time to time, we may also disclose interim data from our preclinical studies and clinical trials. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available or as patients from our clinical trials continue other treatments for their disease. Adverse differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects.\nFurther, disclosure of interim data by us or by our competitors could result in volatility in the price of our common stock. Further, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions, or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate, and our company in general. If the interim, topline, or preliminary data that we report differs from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, and commercialize, any of our potential product candidates may be harmed, which could harm our business, operating results, prospects, or financial condition.\nWe may not be able to obtain or maintain orphan drug designations which we pursue for any of our product candidates, and we may be unable to maintain the benefits associated with orphan drug designation, including the potential for market exclusivity.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may designate a drug as an orphan product if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or a patient population of greater than 200,000 individuals in the United States, but for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States. We have not received orphan drug designation in for any product candidate. We may seek to obtain orphan drug designation for product but there can be no assurance that the FDA will grant orphan designation for any indication for which we apply, or that we will be able to maintain such designation.\nIn the United States, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding toward clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product candidate that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including an NDA, to market the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or where the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity.\nEven if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if such regulatory authority concludes that the later drug is clinically superior because it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care.\nOrphan drug exclusivity may also be lost if the FDA later determines that the initial request for designation was materially defective. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving competing drugs for the same or similar indication containing a different active ingredient. In addition, if a subsequent drug is approved for marketing for the same or a similar indication as any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval, we may face increased competition and lose market share regardless of orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nAZSTARYS, APADAZ and certain of our product candidates contain controlled substances, the manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation, prescribing and distribution of which are subject to regulation by the DEA and other regulatory agencies.\nAZSTARYS, APADAZ, and certain of our product candidates are regulated as controlled substances, which are subject to state, federal, and foreign laws and regulations regarding their manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation, and distribution. Among other things, controlled substances are regulated under the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, and regulations of the DEA. Before we can commercialize any of our products or product candidates, if approved, the DEA will need to determine the controlled substance schedule, taking into account the recommendation of the FDA. This may be a lengthy process that could delay our marketing of a product candidate and could potentially diminish any regulatory exclusivity periods for which we may be eligible.\nThe DEA regulates controlled substances as Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have no established medicinal use and may not be marketed or sold in the United States. A pharmaceutical product may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest risk of abuse and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. The DEA determined APADAZ and AZSTARYS to be Schedule II controlled substances. In addition, the DEA scheduled SDX, the prodrug present within AZSTARYS, as a Schedule IV substance. We expect that most of our product candidates, including KP484, KP879 and KP1077, if approved, will also be regulated as \u201ccontrolled substances\u201d by the DEA, which subjects AZSTARYS, APADAZ and these product candidates to additional restrictions regarding their manufacture, shipment, storage, sale and use, depending on the scheduling of the active ingredients, and may limit the commercial potential of our products and any of our product candidates, if approved.\nVarious states also independently regulate controlled substances. Though state controlled substances laws often mirror federal law, because the states are separate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule drugs as well. While some states automatically schedule a drug when the DEA does so, in other states there must be rulemaking or a legislative action. State scheduling may delay commercial sale of any controlled substance drug product for which we obtain federal regulatory approval and adverse scheduling could impair the commercial attractiveness of such product. We or our collaborators must also obtain separate state registrations in order to be able to obtain, handle and distribute controlled substances for clinical trials or commercial sale, and failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements could lead to enforcement and sanctions from the states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law.\nFor any of our products or product candidates classified as controlled substances, we and our suppliers, manufacturers, contractors, customers and distributors are required to obtain and maintain applicable registrations from state, federal and foreign law enforcement and regulatory agencies and comply with state, federal and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture, use, sale, importation, exportation and distribution of controlled substances. There is a risk that DEA regulations may limit the supply of the compounds used in clinical trials for our product candidates, and, in the future, the ability to produce and distribute our products in the volume needed to meet commercial demand. For example, a DEA quota system controls and limits the availability and production of controlled substances in Schedule I or II. Because our products and most of our product candidates are or may be regulated as Schedule II controlled substances, they may be subject to the DEA\u2019s production and procurement quota scheme. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much of a controlled substance may be produced in total in the United States based on the DEA\u2019s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. Manufacturers of Schedule I and II controlled substances are required to apply for quotas on an annual basis. If we or our contract manufacturers or suppliers do not obtain a sufficient quota from the DEA, we may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of these controlled substances in order to complete our clinical trials or meet commercial demand for any of our products or product candidates classified under Schedule II.\nRegulations associated with controlled substances govern manufacturing, labeling, packaging, testing, dispensing, production and procurement quotas, recordkeeping, reporting, handling, shipment and disposal. These regulations increase the personnel needs and the expense associated with development and commercialization of product candidates including controlled substances. The DEA, and some states, conduct periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Failure to obtain and maintain required registrations or comply with any applicable regulations could delay or preclude us from developing and commercializing our product candidates containing controlled substances and subject us to enforcement action. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In some circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings. Because of their restrictive nature, these regulations could limit commercialization of any of our products or product candidates that are classified as controlled substances.\nOur products and product candidates may be associated with serious adverse events, undesirable side effects or have other properties that could halt their clinical development, prevent their regulatory approval, limit their commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences.\nAdverse events or other undesirable side effects caused by our products or product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approvals by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nDuring the conduct of clinical trials, patients report changes in their health, including illnesses, injuries, and discomforts, to their study doctor. Often, it is not possible to determine whether or not the product candidate being studied caused these conditions. It is possible that as we test our product candidates in larger, longer and more extensive clinical trials, or as use of these product candidates becomes more widespread if they receive regulatory approval, illnesses, injuries, discomforts and other adverse events that were observed in previous trials, as well as conditions that did not occur or went undetected in previous trials, will be reported by patients. Many times, side effects are only detectable after investigational products are tested in large-scale clinical trials or, in some cases, after they are made available to patients on a commercial scale following approval.\nIf any serious adverse events occur, clinical trials or commercial distribution of any product candidates or products we develop could be suspended or terminated, and our business could be seriously harmed. Treatment-related side effects could also affect patient recruitment and the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential liability claims. Regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of, deny approval of, and/or require us to cease selling our products or product candidates, if approved, for any or all targeted indications. If we are required to delay, suspend or terminate any clinical trial or commercialization efforts, the commercial prospects of our products or product candidates may be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from them or other product candidates that we develop may be delayed or eliminated. Additionally, if one or more of our product candidates receives marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable side effects or adverse events caused by such products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nregulatory authorities may suspend, limit or withdraw approvals of such product, or seek an injunction against its manufacture or distribution;\n\u25cf\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label, including \u201cboxed\u201d warnings, or issue safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;\n\u25cf\nwe may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials or post-approval studies;\n\u25cf\nwe may be required to create a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, which could include a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u25cf\nwe may be subject to fines, injunctions or the imposition of criminal penalties;\n\u25cf\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u25cf\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of our products or any of our product candidates, if approved, and could seriously harm our business.\nWe may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause we have limited financial and management resources, we focus on research programs and product candidates that we identify for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial drugs or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nSocial issues around the abuse of opioids and stimulants, including law enforcement concerns over diversion and regulatory efforts to combat abuse, could decrease the potential market for AZSTARYS, APADAZ or any of our other applicable product candidates.\nMedia stories regarding prescription drug abuse and the diversion of opioids, stimulants and other controlled substances are commonplace. Law enforcement and regulatory agencies may apply policies that seek to limit the availability of opioids and stimulants. Such efforts may inhibit the ability to commercialize AZSTARYS under the KP415 License Agreement, APADAZ under the APADAZ License Agreement or to commercialize any of our other applicable product candidates. Aggressive enforcement and unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, the use or misuse of hydrocodone or other opioid drugs and stimulants, the limitations of abuse-deterrent formulations, public inquiries and investigations into prescription drug abuse, litigation or regulatory activity, sales, marketing, distribution or storage of our products could harm our reputation. Such negative publicity could reduce the potential size of the market for AZSTARYS, APADAZ or any of our other applicable product candidates and decrease the revenue we are able to generate from their sale, if approved. Similarly, to the extent prescription drug abuse becomes a less prevalent or less urgent public health issue, regulators and third-party payors may not be willing to pay a premium for formulations with improved attributes of opioids or stimulants.\nAdditionally, efforts by the FDA and other regulatory bodies to combat abuse of opioids and stimulants may negatively impact the market for AZSTARYS, APADAZ and any of our other applicable product candidates. For example, in April 2014, the FDA approved class-wide labeling changes to the indications for use of all approved ER/LA opioids, so that ER/LA opioids will be indicated only for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. These changes have reduced the number of prescriptions for opioids written by physicians and negatively impact the potential market for APADAZ or our other applicable product candidates. The FDA also held a public meeting in October 2014, on the development and regulation of abuse-deterrent formulations of opioid medications. Further, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously issued draft guidelines for the prescribing of opioids for chronic pain, providing recommendations for primary care providers prescribing opioids for chronic pain on when to initiate or continue opioids, opioid selection and discontinuation, and the assessment of the risk and addressing harms of opioid use, among other areas. It is possible that FDA, or other regulatory bodies, will announce new regulatory initiatives at any time that may increase the regulatory burden or decrease the commercial opportunity for AZSTARYS, APADAZ or any of our other applicable product candidates.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs\nAny failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could harm us.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. If our management is unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, or to certify the effectiveness of such controls, or if material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting are identified in the future, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price. In addition, if we do not maintain adequate financial and management personnel, processes and controls, we may not be able to manage our business effectively or accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis, which could cause a decline in our common stock price and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have incurred significant recurring negative net operating cash flows. We expect to incur minimal positive net operating cash flows or negative net operating cash flows over the next several years and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have historically had significant negative net operating cash flows since inception. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 net cash provided by (used in) operations was $10.4 million and ($1.9) million, respectively. We have financed our operations through December 31, 2021 with funds raised in private placements of redeemable convertible preferred stock, in the issuance of convertible promissory notes and term debt, our initial public offering and other public and private offerings of our common stock, as well as through revenue received under the KP415 License Agreement, the Corium Consulting Agreement and other consulting arrangements.\nWe have devoted substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to research and development, including preclinical studies and clinical trials. We are in various stages of development of our product candidates, and we have only completed development of, and received regulatory approval for, two products, AZSTARYS and APADAZ. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses over the next several years and our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year as we:\n\u25cf\ncontinue our ongoing preclinical studies, clinical trials and our product development activities for our pipeline of product candidates;\n\u25cf\nseek regulatory approvals for product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u25cf\ncontinue research and preclinical development and initiate clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nseek to discover and develop additional product candidates either internally or in partnership with other pharmaceutical companies;\n\u25cf\nadapt our regulatory compliance efforts to incorporate requirements applicable to marketed products;\n\u25cf\nmaintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n\u25cf\nincur additional legal, accounting and other expenses in operating as a public company; and\n\u25cf\nadd operational systems and personnel, if needed, to support any future commercialization efforts.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and eventually commercializing prodrugs that generate significant revenue. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical studies and clinical trials and obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates, and manufacturing, marketing and selling, whether ourselves or through a license with a third party, any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval, as well as discovering and developing additional product candidates. We are in various stages of these activities for our product candidates and we cannot guarantee that any strategy we adopt will be successful. For instance, in September 2019, we entered into the KP415 License Agreement with Commave pursuant to which we granted an exclusive, worldwide license to Commave to develop, manufacture and commercialize AZSTARYS and KP484 worldwide. We cannot guarantee that Commave will be able to successfully manufacture or commercialize AZSTARYS, or develop, manufacture or commercialize KP484, if approved, or that we will ever receive any future payments under the KP415 License Agreement. In addition, in October 2018, we entered into the APADAZ License Agreement with KVK pursuant to which we granted an exclusive license to KVK to commercialize APADAZ in the United States. We cannot guarantee that KVK will be able to successfully commercialize APADAZ or that we will ever receive any payments under the APADAZ License Agreement from commercial sales of APADAZ. We may never succeed in commercialization activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenue that is significant enough to achieve profitability.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a global pandemic. This pandemic is causing major disruptions to businesses and markets worldwide as the virus spreads. We cannot predict what the long-term effects of this pandemic and the resulting economic disruptions may have on our liquidity and results of operations. The extent of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our liquidity and results of operations will depend on a number future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the pandemic, and governmental, regulatory and private sector responses, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict. The COVID-19 pandemic may make it more difficult for us to enroll patients in any future clinical trials or cause delays in the regulatory approval of our product candidates. A portion of our projected revenue is based upon the achievement of milestones in the KP415 License Agreement associated with regulatory matters that may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we cannot predict what, if any, impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our ability to achieve these milestones. If the pandemic continues to be a severe worldwide crisis, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with prodrug development, we are unable to accurately predict the timing or amount of expenses or when, or if, we will be able to achieve profitability. If we are required by regulatory authorities to perform studies in addition to those currently expected, or if there are any delays in the initiation and completion of our clinical trials or the development of any of our product candidates, our expenses could increase.\nEven if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable would depress our value and could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts, obtain product approvals, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations. A decline in our value could also cause you to lose all or part of your investment.\nIdentifying potential product candidates and conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials is a time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete, and we may not generate the necessary data or results required to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates or claims necessary to make such candidates profitable and achieve product sales. In addition, AZSTARYS, APADAZ or any of our product candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Our commercial revenue will be derived from sales of prodrug products. We cannot guarantee that Commave will be able to successfully commercialize AZSTARYS or any of the product candidates subject to the KP415 License Agreement, even if approved, that KVK will be able to successfully commercialize APADAZ or that we will ever receive any payments under the KP415 License Agreement from the commercial sales of AZSTARYS or any future payments under the KP415 License Agreement or payment under the APADAZ License Agreement from commercial sales of APADAZ. Accordingly, we will need to continue to rely on additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities, the terms of those securities or debt may restrict our ability to operate. Any future debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include, covenants limiting and restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures, entering into profit-sharing or other arrangements or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or altogether cease our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts.\nWe may need additional funding to pursue our business objectives. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, we could be forced to delay, reduce or altogether cease our prodrug development programs or commercialization efforts or cease operations altogether.\nWe expect that our only sources of revenues will be through payments arising from our license agreements with Commave and KVK, or through the Corium Consulting Agreement or other potential consulting arrangements and any other future arrangements related to one of our other product candidates. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient proceeds from the KP415 License Agreement, the APADAZ License Agreement, the Corium Consulting Agreement or other consulting arrangements, or be successful in completing other transactions, that will fully fund our operating expenses. Further, the economic uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic may dramatically reduce our ability to secure debt or equity financing necessary to support our operations. If we are delayed in obtaining additional funding or are unable to complete a strategic transaction, we may discontinue our development activities on our product candidates or discontinue our operations. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe progress and results of our preclinical studies, clinical trials, chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, and other product development and commercialization activities;\n\u25cf\nthe scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nthe ability to obtain differentiating claims in the labels for our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nthe number and development requirements of other product candidates that we may pursue;\n\u25cf\nthe costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nthe efforts necessary to institute post-approval regulatory compliance requirements;\n\u25cf\nthe costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval;\n\u25cf the commercial revenue received from commercial sales of AZSTARYS under our KP415 License Agreement, APADAZ under our APADAZ License Agreement, or any of our product candidates subject to the terms of the KP415 License agreement, or sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval in the future, which may be affected by market conditions, including obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement of AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our product candidates, from third-party payors, including government programs and managed care organizations, and competition within the therapeutic class to which AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any our product candidates are assigned;\n\u25cf the success of our partner, Commave, in commercializing AZSTARYS, or the successful development of other Additional Products or other Licensed Products in accordance with the terms of the KP415 License Agreement;\n\u25cf\nthe costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims; and\n\u25cf\nthe extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies.\nOur business has been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, in regions where we or third parties on which we rely have clinical trial sites or other business operations In addition, if COVID-19 continues to be a worldwide pandemic, it could materially affect our operations.\nOur business has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, in regions where we have significant manufacturing facilities, concentrations of clinical trial sites, or other business operations.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented limitations on our operations, including a work-from-home policy, and could face further limitations in our operations in the future. There is a risk that countries or regions may be less effective at containing COVID-19 than others, in which case the risks described herein could be elevated significantly.\nIn particular, our future clinical trials may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic or other future health epidemics. Site initiation, patient enrollment, distribution of drug product candidates, study monitoring, and data collection may be delayed due to changes in hospital policies, local regulations, and/or prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic or other future health epidemics. If COVID-19 continues to spread or there are similar health epidemics in the future, some patients and clinical investigators may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols. For example, quarantines may impede patient movement, affect sponsor access to study sites, or interrupt healthcare services, and we may be required to delay patient enrollment or unable to obtain patient data as a result.\nIn addition, third party manufacturing of our products and product candidates and suppliers of the materials used in the production of our product candidates may be impacted by restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or other future health epidemics which may disrupt our supply chain or limit our ability to manufacture drug product candidates for our clinical trials.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar future health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely.\nOur operating history may make it difficult for you to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nWe may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known or unknown factors in achieving our business objectives. We will need to transition at some point from a company with a research and development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. We may not be successful in such a transition.\nWe expect our financial condition and operating results to continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, you should not rely upon the results of any quarterly or annual periods as indications of future operating performance.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely on and expect to continue to rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials for our product candidates, and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily, including failing to meet deadlines for the completion of such trials.\nWe have engaged and expect to continue to engage CROs for our planned clinical trials of our product candidates. We rely on and expect to continue to rely on CROs, as well as other third parties, such as clinical data management organizations, medical institutions and clinical investigators, to conduct those clinical trials. Agreements with such third parties might terminate for a variety of reasons, including a failure to perform by the third parties. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, our drug development activities would be delayed.\nOur reliance on these third parties for research and development activities reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities. For example, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with regulatory standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, investigators and trial sites. We also are required to register specified ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, ClinicalTrials.gov, within specified timeframes. In addition, we must conduct our clinical trials with product produced under cGMP requirements. Failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat preclinical studies and clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements related to clinical investigations by us, our CROs or clinical trial sites can also result in clinical holds and termination of clinical trials, debarment, FDA refusal to approve applications based on the clinical data, warning letters, withdrawal of marketing approval if the product has already been approved, fines and other monetary penalties, delays, adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions, among other consequences.\nFurthermore, these third parties may also have relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols, we will not be able to obtain, or may be delayed in obtaining, marketing approvals for our product candidates and will not be able to, or may be delayed in our efforts to, successfully commercialize our product candidates.\nIn addition, investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and may receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, or the FDA concludes that the financial relationship may have affected the interpretation of the study, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be questioned and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized, which could result in the delay or rejection of any NDA we submit by the FDA. Any such delay or rejection could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates. Further, our arrangements with investigators are also subject to scrutiny under other health care regulatory laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Statute.\nWe also rely on and expect to continue to rely on other third parties to store and distribute product supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our distributors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of our product candidates or commercialization of our products, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue.\nIf the third parties with whom we contract do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, we may need to conduct additional trials, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed. To the extent we are unable to successfully identify and manage the performance of third-party service providers in the future, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe contract with third parties for the manufacture of our partnered products and product candidates that utilize benzhydrocodone and SDX as the API used in our clinical trials and with a sole source supplier for the manufacture of bulk quantities of benzhydrocodone and SDX used in the partnered products and product candidates that utilize these moieties as the API and we expect to continue to do so. This reliance on third-party manufacturers increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of benzhydrocodone and SDX, or such quantities at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts.\nWe do not have any manufacturing facilities. We procure the bulk drug substances for AZSTARYS, KP484, APADAZ, KP879 and KP1077 from sole-source, third-party manufacturers and the partnered products and product candidates that utilize these moieties as the API used in our clinical trials from other third parties. We anticipate we will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. We also expect to continue to rely on third parties as we proceed with preclinical and clinical testing of our product candidates, as well as for commercial manufacture of AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our product candidates should such candidates receive marketing approval. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of benzhydrocodone, SDX, other bulk drug substances or our partnered product or product candidates, or such quantities at an acceptable cost or quality, which could delay, prevent or impair our ability to timely conduct our clinical trials or our other development or commercialization efforts.\nWe may be unable to establish any future agreements with third-party manufacturers or to do so on acceptable terms. Even if we are able to maintain our existing third-party relationships or establish any such agreements with other third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including:\n\u25cf\nreliance on the third party for FDA and DEA regulatory compliance and quality assurance;\n\u25cf\nthe possible misappropriation of our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and know-how;\n\u25cf\ndisruption and costs associated with changing suppliers, including additional regulatory filings;\n\u25cf\nthe possible breach, termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us;\n\u25cf\na delay or inability to procure or expand sufficient manufacturing capacity;\n\u25cf\nmanufacturing and product quality issues related to scale-up of manufacturing;\n\u25cf\ncosts and validation of new equipment and facilities required for scale-up;\n\u25cf\nthe inability to negotiate manufacturing agreements with third parties under commercially reasonable terms;\n\u25cf\ntermination or nonrenewal of manufacturing agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us;\n\u25cf\nthe reliance on a limited number of sources, and in some cases, single sources for product components, such that if we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of these product components, we will be unable to manufacture and sell our product candidates in a timely fashion, in sufficient quantities or under acceptable terms; and\n\u25cf\ncarrier disruptions or increased costs that are beyond our control.\nAny of these events could lead to clinical trial delays, failure to obtain regulatory approval or impact our ability to successfully commercialize our products, if approved. Some of these events could be the basis for FDA action, including injunction, recall, seizure or total or partial suspension of production.\nThe facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture AZSTARYS, APADAZ, and any of our product candidates are subject to review by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit our marketing application to the FDA, and such inspections could result in findings that lead to failure to obtain FDA approval of such marketing applications.\nWe do not, other than through our contractual arrangements, control the manufacturing process of AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our other product candidates, and we are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMP requirements and for manufacture of both active drug substances and finished drug products. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, we will not be able to secure and maintain regulatory approval of our marketing applications for the use of their manufacturing facilities for our products. In addition, other than through our contractual agreements, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacturing of AZSTARYS, APADAZ or any of our other product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain marketing approval for or market AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our other product candidates, if approved.\nFurther, for AZSTARYS, APADAZ and any of our product candidates, if approved, our suppliers will be subject to regulatory requirements, covering manufacturing, testing, quality control and record keeping relating to AZSTARYS, APADAZ or any of our product candidates, if approved, and subject to ongoing inspections by the regulatory agencies. Failure by any of our suppliers to comply with applicable regulations may result in long delays and interruptions to our manufacturing capacity while we seek to secure another supplier that meets all regulatory requirements, as well as market disruption related to any necessary recalls or other corrective actions.\nThird-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including warning letters, clinical holds or termination of clinical trials, fines, injunctions, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals or other permits, FDA refusal to approve pending applications, product detentions, FDA or DEA consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing and distribution operations, debarment, refusal to allow import or export, product detentions, adverse publicity, dear-health-care-provider letters or other warnings, license revocation, seizures or recalls of product candidates, operating restrictions, refusal of government contracts or future orders under existing contracts and civil and criminal liability, including False Claims Act liability, exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, and corporate integrity agreements among other consequences, any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our prodrugs.\nOur product candidates and any prodrugs that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and drugs for access to manufacturing facilities, and we may be unable to obtain access to these facilities on favorable terms.\nThere are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us. Any performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay clinical development or marketing approval. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply or a second source for AZSTARYS, KP484, KP879 or KP1077 bulk drug substance. If our current contract manufacturer for AZSTARYS, KP484, KP879 or KP1077 bulk drug substance cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace such manufacturer and we may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacement. Any performance failure or significant delay could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have entered into collaborations with Commave, to develop, manufacture and commercialize AZSTARYS and KP484 worldwide, and KVK, for the commercialization of APADAZ in the United States. In addition, we may seek collaborations with third parties for the development or commercialization of our other product candidates, or in other territories. If those collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our other product candidates, if approved.\nWe entered into the KP415 License Agreement with Commave pursuant to which we granted an exclusive, worldwide license to Commave to develop, manufacture and commercialize AZSTARYS and KP484. We cannot guarantee that the K415 License Agreement with Commave will be successful or that we will receive any future payments under the KP415 License Agreement. For instance, Commave has the option to terminate the KP415 License Agreement, in its entirety or on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, at their convenience either (i) prior to the first regulatory approval of a product upon sixty days prior written notice or (ii) subsequent to the first regulatory approval of a product upon one hundred twenty days prior written notice. Further, even if Commave does not terminate the KP415 License Agreement, we cannot guarantee that we will receive any additional milestone or royalty payments under the KP415 License Agreement. In addition, under the KP415 License Agreement, we have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that Commave will dedicate to the development, manufacturing or commercialization of AZSTARYS and KP484, and we may not always agree with Commave\u2019s efforts. Our ability to generate revenue under the KP415 License Agreement will depend, in part, on Commave\u2019s ability to successfully perform the functions assigned to it under the KP415 License Agreement.\nIn addition, we have entered into the APADAZ License Agreement with KVK pursuant to which we granted an exclusive license to KVK to commercialize APADAZ in the United States. We cannot guarantee that our collaboration with KVK will be successful or that we will ever receive any payments under the APADAZ License Agreement. For instance, if the Initial Adoption Milestone under the APADAZ License Agreement is not achieved, KVK may terminate the APADAZ License Agreement without making any payments to us. Further, even if the Initial Adoption Milestone under the APADAZ License Agreement is achieved, we cannot guarantee that we will receive any additional milestone or royalty payments under the APADAZ License Agreement. Further, under the APADAZ License Agreement, we have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that KVK will dedicate to the commercialization of APADAZ, and we may not always agree with KVK\u2019s commercialization efforts. Our ability to generate revenue under the APADAZ License Agreement will depend on KVK\u2019s ability to successfully perform the functions assigned to it under the APADAZ License Agreement. The commercialization strategy under the APADAZ License Agreement is novel and untested, and, even if successful we expect that the pricing for any sales of APADAZ will be at or near the prices of currently available generic equivalent drugs. As a result, even if KVK does successfully perform its functions under the APADAZ License Agreement, we cannot guarantee that there will be sufficient market demand for APADAZ for us to receive any revenue under the APADAZ License Agreement.\nWe may also seek additional third-party collaborators for the commercialization of APADAZ outside of the United States or for the development or commercialization of any of our other product candidates, which are not subject to the KP415 License Agreement, or those that are subject to the KP415 License Agreement but the option is not exercised by Commave. In such cases, our likely collaborators would include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional, national and international pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. If we do enter into any such collaboration arrangements with any third parties, we will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of AZSTARYS or APADAZ outside of the United States or any of our other product candidates. Our ability to generate revenue from these arrangements will depend on our collaborators\u2019 abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements.\nOur collaborations with Commave and KVK, or combined, the Collaborators, pose the following risks to us:\n\u25cf\nthe Collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;\n\u25cf\nthe Collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n\u25cf\nthe Collaborators may not pursue commercialization of AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our product candidates covered under the KP415 License Agreement, if approved, or may elect not to continue or renew commercialization programs based on post-approval clinical trial results, changes in a Collaborator's strategic focus or available funding, or external factors, such as an acquisition, that divert resources or create competing priorities;\n\u25cf\nthe Collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our other products covered under the KP415 License Agreement, as applicable, if the Collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours;\n\u25cf\nAZSTARYS, APADAZ, and any of our other products covered under the KP415 License Agreement may be viewed by the Collaborators as competitive with their own product candidates or products, which may cause the Collaborators to cease to devote resources to the commercialization of AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our other products covered under the KP415 License Agreement, if approved;\n\u25cf\nthe Collaborators may not commit sufficient resources to the development, marketing and distribution of AZSTARYS, APADAZ, and any of our other products covered under the KP415 License Agreement, as applicable;\n\u25cf\ndisagreements with the Collaborators, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the preferred course of development or commercialization, might cause delays or termination of the development or commercialization of AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our other products covered under the KP415 License Agreement, as applicable, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our other products covered under the KP415 License Agreement, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u25cf\nthe Collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our or their intellectual property rights or may use our or their proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate such intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u25cf\nthe Collaborators may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability; and\n\u25cf\nthe license agreements may be terminated by the Collaborators under specified circumstances and, if terminated, we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our other products covered under the KP415 License Agreement.\nIf we enter into any future collaborations we will face similar risks with any future collaborators as well.\nThe KP415 License Agreement, the APADAZ License Agreement, and any other licensing or collaboration agreements we may enter into may not lead to commercialization of AZSTARYS, commercialization of APADAZ, or development of KP484, KP879 or any of our other product candidates in the most efficient manner or at all. If Commave or KVK or a future collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our drug development or commercialization program could be delayed, diminished or terminated.\nIf we are not able to establish collaborations for our product candidates, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans.\nOur prodrug development programs and the potential commercialization of our product candidates, if approved, will require substantial additional capital. For our product candidates, which are not subject to the terms of the KP415 License Agreement or the APADAZ License Agreement, we may need to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of those product candidates.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. Whether we reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge, and industry and market conditions generally.\nThe collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our product candidate.\nCollaborations are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. In addition, there have been a significant number of recent business combinations among large pharmaceutical companies that have resulted in a reduced number of potential future collaborators.\nWe may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of product candidates, reduce or delay one or more of our development programs, delay potential commercialization of our product candidates or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities of our product candidates, or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense of our product candidate. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop our product candidates or bring our product candidates to market and generate product revenue.\nProvisions in our agreements with Aquestive and Commave may inhibit our ability to enter into future collaborations with third parties.\nWe are party to a termination agreement with Aquestive Therapeutics, or Aquestive, that may limit the value of any sale, license or commercialization of AZSTARYS, KP484, KP879 or KP1077. Under this termination agreement, Aquestive has the right to receive a royalty amount equal to 10% of any value generated by AZSTARYS, KP484, KP879 or KP1077, and any product candidates which contain SDX, including royalty payments on any license of AZSTARYS, KP484, KP879 or KP1077, the sale of AZSTARYS, KP484, KP879 or KP1077 to a third party or the commercialization of AZSTARYS, KP484, KP879 or KP1077. As part of the KP415 License Agreement, we paid Aquestive a royalty equal to 10% of the license upfront payment we received in 2019 and the regulatory milestone and royalty payments we received in 2020 and 2021 from AZSTARYS.\nWe also granted to Commave a right of first refusal to acquire, license or commercialize any Additional Product Candidate which contains SDX and are intended to treat ADHD or any other CNS disorder, excluding KP922, with such right of first refusal expiring upon the acceptance of a new drug application for such Additional Product Candidate. We also granted Commave a right of first negotiation and a right of first refusal, subject to specified exceptions, for any assignment of our rights under the KP415 License Agreement. We cannot predict if these obligations will limit the value we may receive from any future sale or license of any Additional Product Candidate.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain trade secret protection or patent protection for our technology, AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or our product candidates, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and drugs similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our technology, AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or our product candidates, if approved, may be impaired.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain trade secret protection of our proprietary LAT platform technology as well as patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to AZSTARYS, APADAZ, and any of our product candidates. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our product technology and product candidates. As part of the KP415 License Agreement, Commave obtained from us an exclusive, worldwide license to certain patents that cover AZSTARYS and KP484. In addition, as part of the APADAZ License Agreement, KVK obtained from us an exclusive license to certain patents that cover APADAZ.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. We may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the rights to patents, licensed to third parties by us.\nFurther, we may also not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the rights to patents, licensed from third parties to us. Therefore, any such patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If such licensors or licensees fail to maintain such patents, or lose rights to those patents, the rights we have in- or out-licensed may be reduced or eliminated.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, generally, is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States or visa-versa. For example, European patent law restricts the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and utility, or equivalent, patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically, for example, not published until 18 months after the filing date of such patent applications, or in some cases not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make and/or use the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, priority, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued that protect our product candidates, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and drugs. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.\nOur patent position is subject to numerous additional risks, including the following:\n\u25cf\nwe may fail to seek patent protection for inventions that are important to our success;\n\u25cf\nour pending patent applications may not result in issued patents;\n\u25cf\nwe cannot be certain that we are the first to invent the inventions covered by pending patent applications or that we are the first to file such applications and, if we are not, we may be subject to priority disputes or lose rights;\n\u25cf\nwe may be required to disclaim part or all of the term of certain patents or all of the term of certain patent applications;\n\u25cf\nwe may not be able to acquire patent term extensions or supplemental certificates of certain patents, domestic or foreign, due to regulatory delays, among others, which may affect the term of enforceability of such patents over time;\n\u25cf\nwe may file patent applications but have claims restricted or we may not be able to supply sufficient data to support our claims and, as a result, may not obtain the original claims desired or we may receive restricted claims; alternatively, it is possible that we may not receive any patent protection from an application;\n\u25cf\neven if our owned and licensed patent applications issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any commercial advantage;\n\u25cf\nour competitors may be able to design around our owned or licensed patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or drugs without infringing on our intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf\nwe could inadvertently abandon a patent or patent application, resulting in the loss of protection of intellectual property rights in a particular country, and we, our collaborators or our patent counsel may take action resulting in a patent or patent application becoming abandoned which may not be able to be reinstated or if reinstated, may suffer patent term adjustments or loss;\n\u25cf\nthe claims of our issued patents or patent applications when issued may not cover our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nno assurance can be given that our patents would be declared by a court or tribunal, domestic or foreign, to be valid or enforceable or that a competitor\u2019s technology or product would be found by a court or tribunal, domestic or foreign, to infringe our patents and our patents or patent applications may be challenged by third parties in patent litigation, domestic or foreign, or in proceedings before the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, or its foreign counterparts, and may ultimately be declared invalid or unenforceable or narrowed in scope;\n\u25cf\nthere may be prior art of which we are not aware that may affect the validity or enforceability of a patent claim and there may be prior art of which we are aware, but which we do not believe affects the validity or enforceability of a claim, which may, nonetheless, ultimately be found to affect the validity or enforceability of a claim;\n\u25cf\nthird parties may develop products that have the same or similar effect as our products without infringing our patents;\n\u25cf\nthird parties may intentionally circumvent our patents by means of alternate designs or processes or file applications or be granted patents that would block or hurt our efforts;\n\u25cf\nthere may be dominating or intervening patents relevant to our product candidates of which we are not aware;\n\u25cf\nobtaining regulatory approval for pharmaceutical products is a lengthy and complex process, and as a result, any patents covering our product candidates may expire before or shortly after such product candidates are approved and commercialized;\n\u25cf\nthe patent and patent enforcement laws of some foreign jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States, and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions; and\n\u25cf\nwe may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\nAny of these factors could hurt our ability to gain full patent protection for our products. Registered trademarks and trademark applications in the United States and other countries are subject to similar risks as described above for patents and patent applications, in addition to the risks described below.\nFurther, a third party may misappropriate or reverse engineer our proprietary LAT platform technology, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and resultant product candidates, product technology or prodrugs, or limit the duration of the trade secret protection of our proprietary LAT platform technology.\nMoreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO, or become involved in opposition, litigation, nullity, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize our technology or drugs and compete directly with us, without payment to us or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize drugs without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to seek patent protection or to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates.\nIn addition, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, ownership, scope, priority, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts, patent offices and tribunals in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and drugs, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our product technology, product candidates and prodrugs.\nChanges in patent law in the United States and other jurisdictions could alter or diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products and technologies.\nThe standards that the USPTO and patent offices in other countries use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries could increase the uncertainties and costs, and may diminish our ability to protect our inventions, obtain, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property rights and, more generally, could affect the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our owned and licensed patents.\nIn addition, the patent positions of companies in the development and commercialization of pharmaceuticals are particularly uncertain. The United States Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. Depending on future actions by the United States Congress, the United States courts, the USPTO and the relevant law-making bodies in other countries, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. For example, in the 2013 case Assoc. for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc., the United States Supreme Court held that certain claims to DNA molecules are not patentable. While we do not believe that any of the patents owned or licensed by us will be found invalid based on this decision, future decisions by the courts, the United States Congress or the USPTO may impact the value of our patents.\nFor another example, on September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted in the United States, redefine prior art and may also affect patent litigation. The USPTO recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, and in particular, the first-to-file provisions, only became effective on March 16, 2013.\nThe Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. For instance, the Leahy-Smith Act established the inter partes review and post grant review procedures that has lowered the burden of proof for invalidity challenges to issued patents and limited the ability to amend patent claims in response to such challenges. In addition, patent reform legislation may pass in the future that could lead to additional uncertainties and increased costs surrounding the prosecution, enforcement and defense of our owned and licensed patents and/or patent applications.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors or other third parties may infringe our patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time consuming and divert the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel. Our pending patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents, in addition to counterclaims asserting that our patents are invalid or unenforceable, or both. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, non-enablement or insufficient written description. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO or made a misleading statement during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. In any patent infringement proceeding, there is a risk that a court will decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue. There is also a risk that, even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the court will construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or decide that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue on the grounds that our patent claims do not cover the invention, or decide that the other party\u2019s use of our patented technology falls under the safe harbor to patent infringement under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7271(e)(1). An adverse outcome in a litigation or proceeding involving our patents could limit our ability to assert our patents against those parties or other competitors and may curtail or preclude our ability to exclude third parties from making and selling similar or competitive products and technologies. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition. Similarly, if we assert trademark infringement claims, a court may determine that the marks we have asserted are invalid or unenforceable, or that the party against whom we have asserted trademark infringement has superior rights to the marks in question. In this case, we could ultimately be forced to cease use of such trademarks\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could significantly harm our business.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability, and the ability of any collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. There is considerable intellectual property litigation in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. In particular, we are focused on developing product candidates based on widely used therapeutic agents or drugs, many of which may be protected by proprietary rights of third parties.\nAlthough we seek to develop proprietary prodrug formulations that do not infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we may become party to, or threatened with, future adversarial proceedings or litigation, domestic or foreign, regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our prodrugs or other aspects of our technology, including, for example, interference or derivation proceedings before the USPTO. Third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing patents or patents that may be granted in the future.\nIf we are found to infringe a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing and marketing our technology and drugs. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. We could be forced, including by court order, to cease commercializing the infringing technology or product. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some or all of our business operations.\nCompeting products may also be sold in other countries in which our patent coverage might not exist or be as strong. If we lose a foreign patent lawsuit alleging our infringement of a competitor\u2019s patent, we could be prevented from marketing our products in one or more foreign countries. As a result, our ability to grow our business and compete in the market may be harmed.\nIntellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nEven if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nIn addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could hurt the price of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could compromise our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nWe may need to license intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nA third party may hold intellectual property rights, including patent rights, which are important or necessary to the development of our product candidates. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our product candidates, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and we could be forced to accept unfavorable contractual terms. If we are unable to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be harmed.\nIf we or our third-party licensors fail to comply with our obligations in our intellectual property licenses and funding arrangements with third parties, we could lose rights that are important to our business.\nWe are currently party to license agreements for technologies that we anticipate using in our product development activities. In the future, we may become party to licenses that are important for product development and commercialization. If we or our third-party licensors fail to comply with the obligations under current or future license and funding agreements, our counterparties may have the right to terminate these agreements, we may be forced to terminate these agreement or we may no longer effectively rely on any licenses to us under these agreements, in which event we might not be able to develop, manufacture or market any product or utilize any technology that is covered by these agreements or may face other penalties under the agreements. Such an occurrence could materially and adversely affect the value of a product candidate being developed under any such agreement or could restrict our drug discovery activities. Termination of these agreements or reduction or elimination of our rights under these agreements may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated agreements with less favorable terms or cause us to lose our rights under these agreements, including our rights to important intellectual property or technology.\nThe scope of our intellectual property may be reduced or may need to be reduced due to third-party intellectual property claims.\nOur competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our patent applications, which could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to ours that claims priority to an application filed prior to March 16, 2013, we may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful if, unbeknownst to us, the other party had independently arrived at the same or similar invention prior to our own invention, resulting in a loss of our U.S. patent position with respect to such inventions. In addition, changes enacted on March 16, 2013, to the U.S. patent laws under the Leahy-Smith Act resulted in the United States changing from a \u201cfirst to invent\u201d country to a \u201cfirst to file\u201d country. As a result, we may lose the ability to obtain a patent if another party files with the USPTO first and could become involved in proceedings before the USPTO to resolve disputes related to inventorship. We may also become involved in similar proceedings in other jurisdictions.\nFurthermore, recent changes in U.S. patent law under the Leahy-Smith Act allow for post-issuance challenges to U.S. patents, including ex parte re-examinations, inter partes reviews and post-grant reviews. There is significant uncertainty as to how the new laws will be applied. If our U.S. patents are challenged using such procedures, we may not prevail, possibly resulting in altered or diminished claim scope or loss of patent rights altogether. Similarly, some countries, notably Europe, also have post-grant opposition proceedings or nullity proceedings that can result in changes in scope or cancellation of patent claims.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that we or our employees have misappropriated their intellectual property or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information, show-how or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. For example, in March 2012, we settled litigation regarding similar matters with Shire. We may also in the future be subject to claims that we have caused an employee to breach the terms of his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these potential claims.\nIn addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.\nIf we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A court could prohibit us from using technologies or features that are essential to our products, if such technologies or features are found to incorporate or be derived from the trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and could be a distraction to management. In addition, any litigation or threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire employees or contract with independent service providers. Moreover, a loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize our products.\nAny trademarks we may obtain may be infringed or successfully challenged, resulting in harm to our business.\nWe expect to rely on trademarks as one means to distinguish our product candidates that are approved for marketing from the products of our competitors. We have registered trademarks for LAT and KemPharm. In addition, we have solicited and applied for trademarks for the KemPharm logo and several potential trade names and logos for future product candidates. Third parties may oppose or attempt to cancel our trademark applications or trademarks, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. If our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Our competitors may infringe our trademarks and we may not have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position would be harmed.\nIn addition to seeking patent and trademark protection for our product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented show-how, know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, corporate collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets. Further, we may need to share our trade secrets and confidential know-how with future business partners, collaborators, contractors and others located in countries at heightened risk of theft of trade secrets, including through direct intrusion by private parties or actors in other countries, and those affiliated with or controlled by state actors.\nMonitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures of our intellectual property, including our trade secrets, is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be effective. In addition, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets.\nMoreover, our competitors may independently develop or reverse engineer knowledge, methods, show-how and know-how equivalent to our trade secrets. Competitors could purchase our products and replicate some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts for technologies on which we do not have patent protection. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate such trade secrets, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nPatents are of national or regional effect, and filing, prosecuting and defending patents on all of our products and technologies throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. As such, our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States and we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products or technology and may export otherwise infringing products or technology to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement rights are not as strong as those in the United States. These products may compete with our products and technologies, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. Further, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to pharmaceuticals or biologics, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in other jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any such lawsuits that we initiate and the damages and other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Similarly, if our trade secrets are disclosed in another jurisdiction, competitors worldwide could have access to our proprietary information and we may be without satisfactory recourse. Such disclosure could have a material adverse effect on our business. Moreover, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in intellectual property laws of other countries. In addition, certain developing countries, including China and India, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we and our licensors may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we or our licensors are compelled to grant a license to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nOur decision to seek approval of our product candidates under the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway, if available, may increase the risk that patent infringement suits are filed against us, which would delay the FDA\u2019s approval of such product candidates.\nRegarding any NDA that we may submit under the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway, if there are patents that claim the approved drug contained in our product candidates and referenced in our 505(b)(2) NDA, we must certify to the FDA and notify the patent holder that any patents listed for the approved drug in the FDA\u2019s Orange Book publication are invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of our prodrug. If a patent infringement lawsuit is filed against us within 45 days of its receipt of notice of our certification, the FDA is automatically prevented from approving our 505(b)(2) NDA until the earliest of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a court decision in the infringement case that is favorable to us, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. Such actions are routinely filed by patent owners. Accordingly, we may invest considerable time and expense in the development of our product candidates only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before our product candidates may be commercialized. We may not be successful in defending any patent infringement claim. Even if we are found not to infringe, or a plaintiff\u2019s patent claims are found invalid or unenforceable, defending any such infringement claim would be expensive and time-consuming, and would delay launch of our product candidates and distract management from their normal responsibilities.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of Our Partnered Products and Product Candidates\nIf we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for our product candidates, if approved, we may not be successful in commercializing any approved product candidate in the United States.\nWe have only a limited sales and marketing infrastructure and have no experience in the sale, marketing or distribution of pharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success for any product candidate for which we may obtain marketing approval in the United States, we will need to enter into collaborations with one or more parties or establish our own sales and marketing organization. While we entered into the KP415 License Agreement to establish a collaboration for the commercialization of AZSTARYS and any of our product candidates which are subject to such agreement, and we entered into the APADAZ License Agreement to establish a collaboration for the commercialization of APADAZ, we may not choose to enter into a collaboration for any future approved product. Should we decide to establish our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we would encounter a number of risks. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our product candidates on our own include:\n\u25cf\nour inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u25cf\nour inability to access government and commercial health plan formularies or secure preferred coverage and adequate reimbursement levels;\n\u25cf\nthe inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or achieve adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future prodrug products;\n\u25cf the lack of complementary drugs to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines;\n\u25cf\nliability for personnel, including sales personnel, failing to comply with applicable legal requirements; and\n\u25cf\ncosts associated with maintaining compliance with the FDA\u2019s marketing and promotional requirements, including ongoing training and monitoring, as well as unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf we decide not to or are unable to establish our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and, instead, enter into arrangements with third parties to perform these services, our product revenue and our profitability, if any, are likely to be lower than if we were to sell, market and distribute any product candidates that we develop ourselves. For instance, under the KP415 License Agreement we are entitled to receive quarterly, tiered royalty payments ranging from a percentage in the high single digits to the mid-twenties of Net Sales (as defined in the KP415 License Agreement) in the United States and a percentage in the low to mid-single digits of Net Sales in each country outside of the U.S., in each case subject to specified reductions under certain conditions as described in the KP415 License Agreement, as well as sales milestones based on specified sales targets. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell, market and distribute our product candidates in the future, or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. Further, under the APADAZ License Agreement, we and KVK will share the quarterly net profits of APADAZ by KVK in the United States at specified tiered percentages, with the portion we receive ranging from 30% to 50% of net profits. As a result, we will be entitled to a smaller portion of the net profits of any sales of APADAZ in the United States than if we had decided to sell, market and distribute APADAZ ourselves. We likely will have little control over such third parties, including Commave and KVK, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our product candidates, if approved, effectively. Further, we may be liable for conduct of third parties, including Commave and KVK, acting on our behalf, including failure to comply with legal requirements applicable to sales and marketing of our product or product candidates, if approved. If we do not establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our product candidates, if approved.\nAZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our product candidates that may receive marketing approval, may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nAZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our product candidates that may receive marketing approval, may fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. Despite the fact that APADAZ is now nationally available, we cannot guarantee that it will receive significant, if any, market acceptance in the United States. If AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, do not achieve an adequate level of market acceptance, they may not generate significant product revenue and we may not become profitable. For instance, under the APADAZ License Agreement, we are entitled to milestone and royalty payments only if APADAZ sales in the United States are above specified levels. If APADAZ does not achieve an adequate level of market acceptance, it is unlikely that sales will satisfy these thresholds and we may not be entitled to any payments under the APADAZ License Agreement. Additionally, the commercialization strategy under the APADAZ License Agreement is novel and untested, and, even if successful we expect that the pricing for any sales of APADAZ will be at or near the prices of currently available generic equivalent drugs. Accordingly, we expect that APADAZ will need to achieve broad market acceptance in order for this strategy to be successful. The degree of market acceptance of AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our product candidates if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe efficacy and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments, including less expensive generic treatments;\n\u25cf\nthe ability to obtain differentiating claims in the labels for most of our product candidates;\n\u25cf\nour ability to offer our prodrug products for sale at competitive prices;\n\u25cf\nthe clinical indications for which our product candidates are approved;\n\u25cf the convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u25cf\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u25cf\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u25cf\nthe steps that prescribers and dispensers must take, since AZSTARYS and APADAZ are, and we expect that most of our product candidates are likely going to be considered controlled substances, as well as the perceived risks based upon their controlled substance status;\n\u25cf\nthe ability to manufacture our product in sufficient quantities and yields;\n\u25cf\nthe strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u25cf\nthe availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement or willingness of patients to pay out of pocket in the absence of third-party coverage;\n\u25cf\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u25cf\nany potential unfavorable publicity;\n\u25cf\nany restrictions on the use, sale or distribution of AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our product candidates, including through REMS; and\n\u25cf\nany restrictions on the use of our prodrug products together with other medications.\nWe face substantial competition, which may result in others discovering, developing or commercializing products before or more successfully than we do.\nOur industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We will face competition and potential competition from a number of sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, drug delivery companies and academic and research institutions. Our competitors may develop or market drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products or product candidates and these competitors may also have significantly more resources than us and be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products.\nAZSTARYS currently competes against, and, if approved, we intend for KP484 to compete against, currently marketed, branded and generic methylphenidate products for the treatment of ADHD. Some of these currently marketed products include Janssen\u2019s CONCERTA, Supernus' QUELBREE, Tris Pharma\u2019s QUILLIVANT XR and QUILLICHEW ER, Novartis\u2019 RITALIN, FOCALIN and FOCALIN XR, UCB\u2019s METADATE CD, Noven\u2019s DAYTRANA, Neos Therapeutics\u2019 CONTEMPLA XR-ODT, Ironshore Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\u2019s JORNAY PM and Adlon Therapeutics\u2019 ADHANSIA XR, in addition to multiple other branded and generic methylphenidate products. In addition, AZSTARYS and, if approved, KP484 will face potential competition from any other methylphenidate products for the treatment of ADHD that are currently in or which may enter into clinical development.\nAPADAZ competes against currently marketed, branded and generic hydrocodone/APAP products for short-term (no more than 14 days) management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. In addition, APADAZ may face potential competition from any other hydrocodone/APAP products for short-term (no more than 14 days) management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate that are currently in or which may enter into clinical development.\nIf approved, we intend for KP1077 to compete against Jazz Pharmaceuticals\u2019 XYWAV, and potentially with other products that are currently in development for the treatment of IH, including Harmony Biosciences\u2019 WAKIX. KP1077 could face potential competition from any products for the treatment of IH that are currently in or which may enter into clinical development.\nCurrently, there are no approved drugs in the United States for the treatment of SUD. If approved, KP879 will face potential competition from any products for the treatment of SUD that are currently in, or which may enter into, clinical development.\nMany of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, as well as more experience in the development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Consequently, our competitors may develop products for indications we are pursuing or may pursue in the future, and such competitors\u2019 products may be more effective, better tolerated and less costly than our product candidates. Our competitors may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products than we are. We will also face competition in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment in clinical trials.\nOur competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. If the competitor\u2019s product were similar to our product candidates, we may be required to seek approval via alternative pathways, such as the ANDA, which is used for the development of generic drug products. We may also be blocked from product marketing by periods of patent protection or regulatory exclusivity.\nIn addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic drugs or giving drugs with improved attributes sufficient weight in a comparative clinical cost effectiveness analysis. For some of the indications that we are pursuing, drugs used off-label serve as cheaper alternatives to our product candidates. Their lower prices could result in significant pricing pressure, even if our product candidates are otherwise viewed as a preferable therapy. Additional drugs may become available on a generic basis over the coming years.\nMergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller and other early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.\nConsequently, our competitors may develop products for the treatment of ADHD, pain or for other indications we may pursue in the future, and such competitors\u2019 products may be more effective, better tolerated and less costly than our product candidates. Our competitors may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing their products than we are. We will also face competition in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject enrollment in clinical trials.\nWe may not be able to obtain either five-year FDA regulatory exclusivity as a new chemical entity or three-year FDA regulatory exclusivity.\nThe FDA provides periods of regulatory exclusivity following their approval of an NDA, which provide the holder of an approved NDA limited protection from new competition in the marketplace for the innovation represented by its approved drug. Five-year exclusivity precludes approval of 505(b)(2) applications or ANDAs by delaying the submission or approval of the application, while three-year exclusivity precludes the approval of the application. We intend to seek new chemical entity, or NCE, status for any of our prodrug product candidates as appropriate. Five years of exclusivity are available to NCEs following the approval of an NDA by the FDA. An NCE is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. If a product is not eligible for the NCE exclusivity, it may be eligible for three years of exclusivity. Three-year exclusivity is available to the holder of an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical trials, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence trials, were essential to the approval of the application and were conducted or sponsored by the applicant.\nThere is a risk that the FDA may disagree with any claim that we may make that any of our prodrug product candidates are NCEs and therefore entitled to five-year exclusivity. The FDA may also take the view that the studies that we are conducting are not clinical trials, other than bioavailability and bioequivalence studies, that are essential to approval and therefore do not support three-year exclusivity. Further, to the extent that the basis for exclusivity is not clear, the FDA may determine to defer a decision until it receives an application which necessitates a decision.\nIf we do obtain either five or three years of exclusivity, such exclusivity will not block all potential competitors from the market. Competitors may be able to obtain approval for similar products with different forms of competitive differentiating mechanisms or may be able to obtain approval for similar products without a competitive differentiating mechanism.\nEven if we or our collaborators are able to commercialize AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our product candidates, if approved, they may be subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies.\nThe successful commercialization of AZSTARYS, APADAZ, and any of our product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained will depend, in part, on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained, will be available from government payor programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and managed care plans and other third-party payors. Government authorities and other third-party payors decide which medical products they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels, including co-payments. A trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for drugs and products. Coverage and reimbursement may not be available for any product that we commercialize and, even if these are available, the level of reimbursement may not be satisfactory. Inadequate reimbursement levels may adversely affect the demand for, or the price of, AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Obtaining and maintaining adequate reimbursement for our prodrug products may be difficult. We may be required to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to justify coverage and reimbursement or the level of reimbursement relative to other therapies. Moreover, the trend has been for government and commercial health plans and their pharmacy benefit managers to commoditize drug products through therapeutic equivalence determinations, making formulary decisions based on cost. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize AZSTARYS under the KP415 License Agreement, APADAZ under the APADAZ License Agreement, or commercialize any of our product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved prodrug products, and coverage may be more limited than the indications for which the product is approved by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution expenses. Interim reimbursement levels for new prodrug products, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for prodrug products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Private third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement policies. Except for certain government health care programs, such as the Department of Defense\u2019s TRICARE Uniform Formulary, no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors in the United States. Even state Medicaid programs have their own preferred drug lists that may disadvantage non-preferred brand drugs. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained at all. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved prodrug products that we develop could significantly harm our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize prodrugs and our overall financial condition.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drugs vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a product before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenue able to be generated from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if our product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nThere can be no assurance that AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our product candidates, if they are approved for sale in the United States or in other countries, will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that they will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that coverage or an adequate level of reimbursement will be available, or that third-party payors\u2019 reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability to sell AZSTARYS under the KP415 License Agreement , APADAZ under the APADAZ License Agreement, or our ability to sell any of any of our product candidates profitably if they are approved for sale.\nWe may be subject to enforcement action if we engage in improper marketing or promotion of our products.\nThe FDA closely regulates promotional materials and other promotional activities. Even if the FDA initially approves product labeling that includes a description of our improved attribute claims, the FDA may object to our marketing claims and product advertising campaigns. Failure to comply with the FDA\u2019s promotional, marketing and advertising laws and regulations could lead to the issuance of warning letters, cyber letters, or untitled letters, adverse publicity, the requirement for dear-health-care-provider letters or other corrective information, fines and other monetary penalties, civil or criminal prosecution, including False Claims Act liability, restrictions on our operations and other operating requirements through consent decrees or corporate integrity agreements, debarment, exclusion from participation in federal health care programs and refusal of government contracts or future orders under existing contracts, among other consequences. Any of these consequences would harm the commercial success of our products.\nFurther, our promotional materials, statements and training methods must comply with the FDA\u2019s prohibition of the promotion of unapproved, or off-label, use. Any regulatory approval that the FDA grants is limited to those specific diseases and indications for which a product is deemed to be safe and effective by FDA. For example, the FDA-approved label for AZSTARYS is limited to the acute treatment of ADHD in patients 6 years of age and older, and the FDA-approved label for APADAZ is limited to the short-term (no more than 14 days) management of acute pain severe enough to require an opioid analgesic and for which alternative treatments are inadequate. Physicians may use our products off-label, as the FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician\u2019s independent choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. However, if the FDA determines that our promotional materials, statements or training constitutes promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our promotional materials, statements or training methods or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, such as the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine, disgorgement of money, operating restrictions or criminal penalties. We may also be subject to actions by other governmental entities or private parties, such as the False Claims Act, civil whistleblower or \u201cqui tam\u201d actions. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In that event, our reputation could be damaged and adoption of the products could be impaired. In addition, the off-label use of our products may increase the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in substantial damage awards against us and harm our reputation.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to limit commercialization of AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our product candidates that we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk as AZSTARYS, APADAZ, and any of our product candidates that may be approved in the future, are commercialized. This includes the risk that our products may be misused. For example, AZSTARYS and APADAZ do, and we anticipate that any of our product candidates we may choose to develop in the future, if approved, may carry, a boxed warning regarding lethality if our oral tablets or capsules are prepared for injection and hepatotoxicity, as is commonly done by abusers of opioids. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products caused injuries, we will incur substantial liabilities on behalf of ourselves. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf\ndecreased demand for AZSTARYS, APADAZ, and any of our product candidates that we may develop;\n\u25cf\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u25cf\ntermination of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u25cf\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u25cf\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u25cf\na diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u25cf\nsubstantial monetary awards paid to trial participants or patients;\n\u25cf\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling revisions and marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u25cf\nloss of revenue;\n\u25cf\nreduced resources of our management to pursue our business strategy; and\n\u25cf\nthe inability to successfully commercialize AZSTARYS, APADAZ, or any of our product candidates that might be approved in the future.\nWe currently hold $10.0 million in product liability insurance coverage in the aggregate, with a per incident limit of $10.0 million, which may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We may need to increase our insurance coverage as we expand our clinical trials or upon commencement of commercialization of any product approved in the future. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.\nA variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe expect to engage in significant cross-border activities, and we will be subject to risks related to international operations, including:\n\u25cf\ndifferent regulatory requirements for maintaining approval of drugs in foreign countries;\n\u25cf\ndiffering payor reimbursement regimes, governmental payors or patient self-pay systems and price controls;\n\u25cf\nreduced protection for contractual and intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u25cf\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\neconomic weakness, including inflation, labor shortages, supply chain shortages, or other economic or political uncertainties or instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u25cf foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u25cf\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in North America;\n\u25cf\ntighter restrictions on privacy and the collection and use of patient and clinical trial participant data; and\n\u25cf\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nFailure to obtain marketing approval in international jurisdictions would prevent AZSTARYS, APADAZ, and any of our other product candidates from being marketed abroad.\nIn order to market and sell our products in the European Union and any other jurisdictions, we must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the United States generally includes all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, it is required that the product be approved for reimbursement before the product can be approved for sale in that country. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the United States on a timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA. However, failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may impact our ability to obtain approval elsewhere. We may not be able to file for marketing approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market.\nA variety of risks associated with marketing AZSTARYS and any of our product candidates internationally, if approved, could affect our business.\nWe may seek regulatory approval for AZSTARYS and any of our product candidates, if approved, outside of the United States and, accordingly, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to operating in foreign countries if we obtain the necessary approvals, including:\n\u25cf\ndiffering regulatory requirements in foreign countries;\n\u25cf the potential for so-called parallel importing, which is what happens when a local seller, faced with high or higher local prices, opts to import goods from a foreign market with low or lower prices rather than buying them locally;\n\u25cf\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\neconomic weakness, including inflation, labor shortages, supply chain shortages, or other economic or political uncertainties or instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u25cf\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u25cf\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u25cf\npotential liability under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 or comparable foreign regulations;\n\u25cf\nchallenges enforcing our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States;\n\u25cf\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u25cf\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism, such as the current situation with Ukraine and Russia.\nThese and other risks associated with our international operations may compromise our ability to achieve or maintain profitability.\nAZSTARYS and APADAZ are, and any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval will remain subject to significant post-marketing regulatory requirements and oversight.\nAZSTARYS and APADAZ are, and any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval could be, subject to significant post-marketing regulatory requirements and oversight, including the submission of reports to regulatory authorities and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product, significant limitations related to use restrictions for specified age groups, warnings, precautions or contraindications, and burdensome post-approval study or risk management requirements.\nFor example, we are required to conduct pediatric studies related to AZSTARYS to evaluate its safety and effectiveness for the claimed indication in pediatric patients. Under the KP415 License Agreement, Commave will be responsible for these regulatory activities going forward, and we cannot guarantee they will be complied with. In addition, we are required to conduct pediatric studies related to APADAZ to evaluate its safety and effectiveness for the claimed indication in pediatric patients. Under the APADAZ License Agreement, KVK will be responsible for these regulatory activities going forward, and we cannot guarantee they will be complied with.\nIn addition, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export and recordkeeping for any approved drugs are subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, payment of substantial annual product and establishment fees, labeling requirements, promotional, marketing and advertising requirements, requirements related to further development, packaging, storage and distribution requirements, cGMP requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. If there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, manufacturing processes or facilities, or new safety issues arise, a new or supplemental NDA, a post-implementation notification or other reporting may be required or requested depending on the change, which may require additional data or additional preclinical studies and clinical trials.\nAZSTARYS and APADAZ are, and if marketing approval of any of our product candidates is granted, such product candidates may be, subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, including the requirement to implement a REMS, which could involve requirements for, among other things, a medication guide, special training for prescribers and dispensers, and patient registries. For example, in September 2018, the FDA approved the Opioid Analgesic REMS for ER/LA and IR opioids as one strategy among multiple national and state efforts to reduce the risk of abuse, misuse, addiction, overdose, and deaths due to prescription opioid analgesics. APADAZ is subject to this REMS, and we anticipate that any of our other opioid product candidates that we may choose to develop in the future, if approved by the FDA, are likely to also be subject to a REMS requirement.\nThe FDA may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. APADAZ is subject to a post-marketing requirement for four deferred pediatric assessments that must be completed pursuant to the FDA\u2019s February 2018 approval letter.\nProducts may be approved with a label that limits their approved uses, including more limited subject populations, than we request, and regulatory authorities may require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate, which could limit sales of the product. For instance, the labels for both AZSTARYS and APADAZ contain black box warnings regarding the risks of abuse and dependence, and the label for APADAZ also includes warnings regarding the risks of hepatoxicity and respiratory depression, among others.\nViolations of the FFDCA relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to a number of actions and penalties, including warning letters, cyber letters, or untitled letters, adverse publicity, the requirement for dear-health-care-provider letters or other corrective information, fines and other monetary penalties, civil or criminal prosecution, including False Claims Act liability, restrictions on our operations and other operating requirements through consent decrees or corporate integrity agreements, debarment, exclusion from participation in federal health care programs and refusal of government contracts or future orders under existing contracts, among other consequences.\nIn addition, later discovery of previously unknown adverse events or other problems with our prodrug products, including those related to manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may have negative consequences, including:\n\u25cf\nadverse inspectional findings;\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on such prodrug products, distribution, manufacturers or manufacturing processes;\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on the labeling or marketing of a drug;\n\u25cf\nadditional warnings or other restrictions on the product\u2019s indicated use, label, or marketing;\n\u25cf\nissuance of safety alerts, dear-healthcare-provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings regarding the product;\n\u25cf\nrequirement to establish or modify a REMS;\n\u25cf\nrequirement to conduct post-marketing studies or surveillance;\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on drug distribution or use;\n\u25cf\nrequirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nwarning letters;\n\u25cf\nrecall or withdrawal of the prodrug products from the market;\n\u25cf\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit and other delays;\n\u25cf\nclinical holds, or the suspension or termination of ongoing clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nfines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n\u25cf\nsuspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals or other permits or voluntary suspension of marketing;\n\u25cf\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our prodrug products;\n\u25cf\nreputational harm;\n\u25cf\nrefusal of government contracts or future orders under existing contracts, exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, and corporate integrity agreements;\n\u25cf\nproduct seizure or detention; or\n\u25cf\ninjunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, including False Claims Act liability.\nNon-compliance with European Union requirements regarding safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requi rements related to the development of drugs for the pediatric population, can also result in significant financial penalties. Similarly, failure to comply with the European Union\u2019s requirements regarding the protection of personal information can also lead to significant penalties and sanctions.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenue, and could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity. In addition, the FDA\u2019s and other regulatory authorities\u2019 policies may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could impair our business. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may be subject to enforcement action, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, CROs, consultants, commercial collaborators, contract manufacturers, service providers and other vendors may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nWe are exposed to the risk of misconduct by employees and independent contractors, such as principal investigators, CROs, consultants, commercial collaborators, contract manufacturers, service providers and other vendors. Such misconduct could include failures to comply with FDA regulations, to provide accurate information to the FDA, to comply with manufacturing standards that we have established or that are established by regulation, to comply with federal and state contracting and healthcare fraud and abuse laws, to report drug pricing, financial information or data accurately or to disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and other business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws may restrict or prohibit a wide range of business activities, including, but not limited to, research, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, discounting, marketing, advertising and promotion, sales commissions, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee and independent contractor misconduct could also involve the improper use of individually identifiable information, including, without limitation, information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. In addition, federal procurement laws impose substantial penalties for misconduct in connection with government contracts and require certain contractors to maintain a code of business ethics and conduct and self-disclose credible evidence of False Claims Act violations. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee and independent contractor misconduct, and any precautions we take to detect and prevent improper activities may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws. If any such actions are instituted against us, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of warning letters, untitled letters, cyber letters, seizure or recall of products, injunctions, withdrawal of product approval or other permits, clinical holds and termination of clinical trials, FDA refusal to approve pending applications, product detentions, FDA or DEA consent decrees, restriction or suspension of manufacturing and distribution, debarment, refusal to allow product import or export, adverse publicity, refusal of government contracts or future orders under existing contracts, dear-health-care-provider letters or other warnings or corrective information, recalls, delays, significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties including False Claims Act liability, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, restitution, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, corporate integrity agreements, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, among other consequences, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nOur current and future relationships with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere may be subject, directly or indirectly, to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, physician payment transparency, and other healthcare laws and regulations, which could expose us to penalties.\nHealthcare providers and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of our products, as well as any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our and our commercial partners' current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws, including, without limitation, the Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act, that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we and our commercial partners sell, market and distribute any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to transparency laws with respect to drug pricing and transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare professionals. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws that may affect our ability to operate include the following:\n\u25cf\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of, any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u25cf\nfederal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, which impose criminal and civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making or using a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government, including erroneous pricing information on which mandatory rebates, discounts and reimbursement amounts are based, or in the case of the False Claims Act, for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute in connection with a claim for payment or for conduct constituting reckless disregard for the truth;\n\u25cf\nthe civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent;\n\u25cf\nthe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of whether the payor is public or private, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u25cf\nthe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act and its implementing regulations, impose new annual reporting requirements for manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, to annually report certain payments and transfers of value provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other healthcare professionals (physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants and certified nurse-midwives) and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, such providers and teaching hospitals, and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and\n\u25cf\nanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; certain state laws which require drug manufacturers to comply with the industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government and may require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; certain state laws that require manufacturers to report information on the pricing of certain drug products; and certain state and local laws require the registration or pharmaceutical sales representatives.\nThese laws may affect our and our commercial partners' sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us and our commercial partners.\nEfforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws, or that our compliance systems are inadequate to detect and report such conduct or to report accurate pricing information to the government. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, corporate integrity agreements or similar agreements to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, which could significantly harm our business. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we currently, or expect to, do business, including future collaborators, is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they and we may be subject to significant penalties and potential exclusion from participation in healthcare programs as a result of their non-compliance.\nRecently enacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of our product candidates and increase the cost to commercialize AZSTARYS, APADAZ, and any of our product candidates that may be approved in the future and affect the prices thereof.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect the ability to profitably sell AZSTARYS under the KP415 License Agreement or APADAZ under the APADAZ License Agreement and our ability to profitably sell any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nAmong policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. For example, in March 2010, the ACA was signed into law and was intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.\nAmong the provisions of the ACA of importance to our potential product candidates are the following:\n\u25cf\nan annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;\n\u25cf\nan increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded drugs and generic drugs, respectively;\n\u25cf\nexpansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for non-compliance;\n\u25cf\nestablishment of a new and distinct methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;\n\u25cf\na new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices (generally as negotiated between the Medicare Part D plan and the pharmacy) of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u25cf\nextension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations and extension of the inflation percentage applicable to existing branded drugs to new formulations for purposes of computing the inflation penalty component of Medicaid rebates;\n\u25cf\nexpansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability;\n\u25cf\nexpansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u25cf\nthe new requirements under the federal Open Payments program and its implementing regulations;\n\u25cf\na new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians; and\n\u25cf\na new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.\nSince its enactment, there have been executive, judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA and our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013, and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nFurther, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could negatively impact customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations. It is also possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe expect that the healthcare reform measures that have been adopted and may be adopted in the future, may, among other things, result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our prodrug product candidates.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals and enacted statutes have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for drugs. For instance, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, among others, related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this new legislation, manufacturers are required to provide specified information regarding the drug products they produce to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug products with a product identifier and keep specified records regarding the drug products. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers are also required to verify that purchasers of products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this legislation, manufacturers have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition and FDA and trading-partner notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.\nWe cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nGovernments outside the United States tend to impose strict price controls, which may affect our revenue, if any.\nIn some countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain coverage and reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our prodrug products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be harmed, possibly materially.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nIf our security measures are compromised now, or in the future, or the security, confidentiality, integrity or availability of, our information technology, software, services, communications or data is compromised, limited or fails, this could result in a material adverse impact, including without limitation, a material interruption to our operations, harm to our reputation, significant fines, penalties and liability, breach or a triggering of data protection laws, privacy policies and data protection obligations, loss of customers or sales, or material disruption of our clinical trials or other business activity.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may collect, process and store proprietary, confidential and sensitive information, including personal information (including key-coded data and health information), intellectual property, trade secrets and proprietary business information owned or controlled by ourselves or other parties.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our information technology systems and data, and those of our CROs and other third parties on which we rely, are vulnerable to system failure, interruption, compromise or damage from several sources, such as data corruption; breakdown; malicious human acts; malicious code (such as computer viruses or worms); fraudulent activity; employee misconduct, theft or error; denial-of-service attacks; public health epidemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic); cyber-attacks by sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors; natural disasters; terrorism; war (such as the current situation with Ukraine and Russia); and telecommunication and electrical failures. Our recovery systems (and those of third parties upon whom we rely) are similarly vulnerable. Any of these events could lead to the unauthorized access, disclosure and use of proprietary, confidential, or otherwise non-public information (such as personal information). The techniques used by criminal actors to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. As a result, we may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures. Attacks upon information technology systems are also increasing in their levels of persistence and intensity, and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may also face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who are working remotely, which may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. We may also experience security breaches that may remain undetected for an extended period. We may be required to expend significant resources, fundamentally change our business activities and practices, or modify our operations, including our clinical trial activities, or information technology in an effort to protect against security breaches and to mitigate, detect and remediate actual and potential vulnerabilities. Due to the nature of some of these threats, we may be unable to anticipate threats, and there is a risk that a threat may remain undetected for a period of time. The costs of maintaining or upgrading our cyber-security systems at the level commercially reasonable to keep up with our expanding operations and prevent against potential attacks are increasing, and despite our best efforts, our network security and data recovery measures and those of our vendors may still not be adequate to protect against such security breaches and disruptions, which could cause harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we, our service providers, partners, or other relevant third parties have experienced, or in the future experience, any security incident(s) that result in any data loss, deletion or destruction, unauthorized access to, loss of, acquisition or disclosure of, exposure or disclosure of sensitive information, or compromise related to the security, confidentiality, integrity or availability of our (or their) information technology, software, services, communications or data, it may result in a material adverse impact, including without limitation, fines, damages, litigation, enforcement actions, loss of trade secrets, a material disruption of our drug development programs, or other harm to our business. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing or planned clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of our product candidates could be delayed. Additionally, applicable data protection laws, privacy policies and data protection obligations (such as contractual obligations) may require us to notify relevant stakeholders of security breaches, including affected individuals, customers and regulators. Such disclosures are costly, and the disclosure or the failure to comply with such requirements, could lead to material adverse impacts, including without limitation, negative publicity, a loss of confidence in our products or operations or breach of contract claims. There can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages if we fail to comply with applicable data protection laws, privacy policies or data protection obligations related to information security or security breaches.\nFurther, failures or significant downtime of our information technology or telecommunication systems or those used by our third-party service providers could cause significant interruptions in our operations and adversely impact the confidentiality, integrity and availability of sensitive or confidential information, including preventing us from conducting clinical trials, tests or research and development activities and preventing us from managing the administrative aspects of our business.\nWe cannot be sure that our insurance coverage will be adequate or otherwise protect us from or adequately mitigate liabilities or damages with respect to claims, costs, expenses, litigation, fines, penalties, business loss, data loss, regulatory actions or materially adverse impacts arising out of our privacy and cybersecurity practices, processing or security breaches that we may experience, or that such coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms at all. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage, or results in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of a large deductible or co-insurance requirements), could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot be sure that our existing coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim.\nFailure or perceived failure to comply with existing or future laws, regulations, contracts, self-regulatory schemes, policies, standards and other obligations related to data privacy or security could lead to government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal fines or penalties), a disruption of our clinical trials or commercialization of our products, private litigation, other liabilities, and/or adverse publicity. Compliance or the failure to comply with such obligations could increase the costs of our products, could limit their use or adoption, and could otherwise negatively affect our operating results and business.\nRegulation of data (including personal data)is evolving, as federal, state, and foreign governments continue to adopt new, or modify existing, laws and regulations addressing data privacy and security, and the collection, processing, storage, transfer, and use of data. We and our collaborators may be subject to current, new, or modified federal, state, and foreign data protection laws and regulations. These new or proposed laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions, and guidance on implementation and compliance practices are often updated or otherwise revised, which adds to the complexity of processing personal data. Moreover, we are subject to the terms of our privacy and security policies, representations, certifications, standards, publications, contracts and other obligations to third parties related to data privacy, security and processing. These and other requirements could require us or our collaborators to incur additional costs to achieve compliance, limit our competitiveness, necessitate the acceptance of more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to use, store, transfer, and process data, impact our or our collaborators\u2019 ability to process or use data in order to support the provision of our products, affect our or our partners\u2019 ability to offer our products or operate in certain locations, cause regulators to reject, limit, or disrupt our clinical trial activities, result in increased expenses, reduce overall demand for our products and services and make it more difficult to meet expectations of or commitments to customers or collaborators.\nIn the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. These laws and regulations could apply to our operations, the operations of our collaborators or other relevant stakeholders upon whom we depend. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (including research institutions from which we may obtain clinical trial data) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. We do not believe that we are currently acting as a covered entity or business associate under HIPAA and thus are not directly subject to its requirements or penalties. However, any person may be prosecuted under HIPAA\u2019s criminal provisions either directly or under aiding-and-abetting or conspiracy principles. Consequently, depending on the facts and circumstances, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including if we knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.\nCertain states have also adopted comparable privacy and security laws and regulations, some of which may be more stringent than HIPAA. For example, the CCPA became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents individual privacy rights, including the right to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. It also provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action and statutory damages for data breaches that is expected to increase class action data breach litigation. Although there are limited exemptions for clinical trial data, the CCPA\u2019s implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Further, it is anticipated that the CCPA will be expanded on January 1, 2023, when the CPRA becomes operative. The CPRA will, among other things, give California residents the ability to limit use of certain sensitive information, establish restrictions on the retention of personal information, expand the types of data breaches subject to the CCPA\u2019s private right of action and establish a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law. Similar laws have passed in Virginia and Colorado, and have been proposed in other states and at the federal level, reflecting a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States. As we expand our operations, these and similar laws may increase our compliance costs and potential liability.\nForeign data protection laws, such as the GDPR and member state data protection laws, may also apply to health-related and other personal data that we process, including personal data relating to clinical trial participants. European data protection laws impose strict obligations on the ability to process health-related and other personal data of data subjects in Europe, including standards relating to the privacy and security of personal data. For example, the GDPR went into effect in May 2018 and imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the EEA. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to \u20ac20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Among other requirements, the GDPR regulates transfers of personal data subject to the GDPR to third countries that have not been found to provide adequate protection to such personal data, including the United States, and the efficacy and longevity of current transfer mechanisms between the European Union and the United States remains uncertain. A decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union limited how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the European Union/EEA to the United States by invalidating the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, and raised questions about whether the European Commission\u2019s Standard Contractual Clauses, or SCCs, one of the primary alternatives to the Privacy Shield, can lawfully be used for personal information transfers from Europe to the United States or most other countries. Similarly, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner recently opined that the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield is inadequate for transfers of personal data from Switzerland to the U.S. The European Commission issued revised SCCs on June 4, 2021 to account for the decision of the CJEU and recommendations made by the European Data Protection Board. The revised SCCs must be used for relevant new data transfers from September 27, 2021; existing standard contractual clauses arrangements must be migrated to the revised clauses by December 27, 2022. The new SCCs apply only to the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA and not the United Kingdom; the United Kingdom\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office launched a public consultation on its draft revised data transfers mechanisms in August 2021. There is some uncertainty around whether the revised clauses can be used for all types of data transfers, particularly whether they can be relied on for data transfers to non-EEA entities subject to the GDPR. As supervisory authorities issue further guidance on personal data export mechanisms, including circumstances where the SCCs cannot be used, and/or start taking enforcement action, we could suffer additional costs, complaints and/or regulatory investigations or fines, and/or if we are otherwise unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which we operate, it could affect the manner in which we provide our services, the geographical location or segregation of our relevant systems and operations, and could adversely affect our financial results. Additionally, other countries have passed or are considering passing laws requiring local data residency and/or restricting the international transfer of data.\nFurther, from January 1, 2021, companies have had to comply with the GDPR and also the UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, i.e., fines up to the greater of \u20ac20 million (\u00a317.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. European data protection laws may affect our use, collection, analysis, and transfer (including cross-border transfer) of such personal data. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how United Kingdom data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term. The European Commission has adopted an adequacy decision in favor of the United Kingdom, enabling data transfers from EU member states to the United Kingdom without additional safeguards. However, the UK adequacy decision will automatically expire in June 2025 unless the European Commission re-assesses and renews/ extends that decision.\nFailure, or perceived failure, to comply with federal, state and foreign data protection laws and regulations, privacy policies, contracts and other data protection obligations could result in government investigations and enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties, fines, or sanctions), private litigation, a diversion of management\u2019s attention, adverse publicity and other negative effects on our operating results and business. There can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages if we fail to comply with applicable data protection laws, privacy policies or data protection obligations related to information security or security breaches. Moreover, clinical trial participants or subjects about whom we or our collaborators obtain information, as well as the providers who share this information with us, may contractually limit our ability to use and disclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals\u2019 privacy rights or failed to comply with data protection laws, contracts, privacy notices or other obligations even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.\nAny of these matters could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or operational results.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Our Growth\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key executives and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on the management, research and development, clinical, financial and business development expertise of Travis C. Mickle, Ph.D., our president and chief executive officer, R. LaDuane Clifton, CPA, our chief financial officer, and Sven Guenther, Ph.D., our executive vice president research and development, as well as the other members of our scientific and clinical teams. Although we have employment agreements with each of our executive officers, these agreements do not obligate them to continue working for our company and they may terminate their employment with us at any time.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific and clinical personnel and, if we progress the development of our product candidate pipeline toward scaling up for commercialization, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel, will also be critical to our success. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize our prodrug product candidates. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel. We also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock and Our Status as a Public Company\nThe trading price of the shares of our common stock is likely to be volatile, and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in April 2015 at a price of $176.00 per share (adjusted to give effect to the 1-for-16 reverse stock split), our stock price has ranged from a low of $1.94 to a high of $418.40 through March 29, 2022. In addition, the stock market in general and the market for pharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price paid for the shares. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nactual or anticipated variations in our operating results;\n\u25cf\nchanges in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock;\n\u25cf\nconditions or trends in our industry, including without limitation changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u25cf\nstock market price and volume fluctuations of comparable companies and, in particular, those that operate in the pharmaceutical industry;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;\n\u25cf\nadverse regulatory announcements or determinations regarding our product candidates;\n\u25cf\ncapital commitments;\n\u25cf\ninvestors\u2019 general perception of us and our business;\n\u25cf global macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, labor shortages, supply chain shortages, or other economic, political or legal uncertainties or adverse developments;\n\u25cf political unrest, terrorism and wars, such as the current situation with Ukraine and Russia, which could delay or disrupt our business, and if such political unrest escalates or spills over to or otherwise impacts additional regions it could heighten many of the other risk factors included in this Item 1A;\n\u25cf other events or factors, including those resulting from system failures and disruptions, earthquakes, hurricanes, other natural disasters, pandemics, or responses to these events;\n\u25cf\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel; and\n\u25cf\nsales of our common stock, including sales by our directors and officers or specific stockholders.\nMany of the factors described above are not within our control. For instance, in May 2016, we announced that the Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee and the Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee of the FDA voted 16 to 4 for the approval of APADAZ but voted 18 to 2 against inclusion of abuse-deterrent labeling for APADAZ. The announcement was followed by a substantial decrease in the trading price of our common stock on Nasdaq. Additionally, when we announced in June 2016 that the FDA had issued a CRL for the APADAZ NDA, the trading price of our common stock on Nasdaq was subject to another substantial decrease. We cannot guarantee that future announcements will not have similar effects on the trading price of our common stock.\nIn addition, in the past, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies\u2019 stock. For instance, in December 2016, we received notice of a class action suit filed against us in the Iowa District Court in Johnson County by a stockholder alleging that we, certain of our senior executives and directors who signed the registration statement in connection with our initial public offering, and each of the investment banks that acted as underwriters for the offering negligently issued untrue statements of material facts and omitted to state material facts required to be stated in the registration statement and incorporated offering materials that we filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, in support of the offering. In June 2018, the case was dismissed without prejudice to members of the putative class. Future litigation could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business. Further, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nA portion of our outstanding warrants are entitled to certain anti-dilution protections which, if triggered, may cause dilution to your investment.\nThe Deerfield Warrant includes an exercise price protection provision, pursuant to which the exercise price of the Deerfield Warrant will be adjusted downward on a broad-based weighted-average basis if we issue or sell any shares of common stock, convertible securities, warrants or options at a sale or exercise price per share less than the greater of (i) $38.34 per share, which represents the Deerfield Warrant\u2019s exercise price, or (ii) the closing sale price of our common stock on the last trading date immediately prior to such issuance or, in the case of a firm commitment underwritten offering, on the date of execution of the underwriting agreement between us and the underwriters for such offering. Additionally, if we effect an \u201cat the market offering\u201d, as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act, of our common stock, the exercise price of the Deerfield Warrant will be adjusted downward pursuant to this anti-dilution adjustment only if such sales are made at a price less than $38.34 per share, provided that this anti-dilution adjustment will not apply to certain specified sales. For example, in June 2021, we entered into the June 2021 Inducement Letters with certain holders of the January 2021 Inducement Warrants, pursuant to which such holders exercised for cash their January 2021 Inducement Warrants to purchase 6,117,509 shares of our common stock in exchange for the June 2021 Inducement Warrants on substantially the same terms as the January 2021 Inducement Warrants, except as set forth in the following sentence, to purchase up to 1,529,379 shares of our common stock, which was equal to 25% of the number of shares of our common stock issued upon exercise of the January 2021 Inducement Warrants. The purchase price of the June 2021 Inducement Warrants was $0.125 per share underlying each June 2021 Inducement Warrant, and the June 2021 Inducement Warrants have an exercise price of $16.50 per share. The completion of this transaction resulted in the exercise price of the Deerfield Warrant being adjusted downward to $38.34 per share from its pre-transaction exercise price of $46.25 per share.\nFuture sales and issuances of equity and debt could result in additional dilution to our stockholders.\nWe may need additional capital in the future to fund our planned future operations, including to complete potential clinical trials for our product candidates. To raise capital, we may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time.\nFor instance, in January 2021, we issued and sold 6,765,463 shares of our common stock, pre-funded warrants to purchase 926,844 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 7,692,307 shares of our common stock at an exercise price per share of $6.50 in the Public Offering (as defined herein). Also in January 2021, the underwriter exercised its over-allotment option, in part, for warrants to purchase 754,035 shares of our common stock. Further, in February 2021, the underwriter again exercised its over-allotment option, in part, to purchase 374,035 shares of our common stock.\nAlso in January 2021, we entered into the January 2021 Inducement Letters with certain holders of the Existing Warrants, pursuant to which such holders exercised for cash their Existing Warrants to purchase 6,620,358 shares of our common stock in exchange for the January 2021 Inducement Warrants on substantially the same terms as the Existing Warrants, except as set forth in the following sentence, to purchase up to 7,944,430 shares of our common stock, which was equal to 120% of the number of shares of our common stock issued upon exercise of the Existing Warrants. The purchase price of the January 2021 Inducement Warrants was $0.125 per share underlying each January 2021 Inducement Warrant, and the January 2021 Inducement Warrants had an exercise price of $6.36 per share.\nIn addition, in June 2021, we entered into the June 2021 Inducement Letters with certain holders of the January 2021 Inducement Warrants, pursuant to which such holders exercised for cash their January 2021 Inducement Warrants to purchase 6,117,509 shares of our common stock in exchange for the June 2021 Inducement Warrants on substantially the same terms as the January 2021 Inducement Warrants, except as set forth in the following sentence, to purchase up to 1,529,379 shares of our common stock, which was equal to 25% of the number of shares of our common stock issued upon exercise of the January 2021 Inducement Warrants. The purchase price of the June 2021 Inducement Warrants was $0.125 per share underlying each June 2021 Inducement Warrant, and the June 2021 Inducement Warrants have an exercise price of $16.50 per share.\nIf the holders of any of these warrants elect to exercise such warrants and receive shares of common stock, your ownership interest will be diluted and the market price of our common stock may be materially and adversely effected.\nIn June 2021, at the annual meeting of stockholders, the stockholders approved the Amended and Restated 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, which, among other things, added 4,900,000 shares to the equity plan pool, and the employee stock purchase plan, or the 2021 ESPP, which allows for employees to purchase up to 1.5 million shares of stock through the plan. In addition, in July 2021, the Company entered into the Equity Distribution Agreement with JMP Securities LLC, or JMP, and RBC Capital Markets, LLC, or RBCCM, under which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $75,000,000 through JMP and RBCCM as its sales agents.\nPursuant to our equity incentive plan, we may grant equity awards and issue additional shares of our common stock to our employees, directors and consultants, and the number of shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under this plan will be subject to automatic annual increases in accordance with the terms of the plans. To the extent that new options are granted and exercised, or we issue additional shares of common stock in the future, either through the 2021 ESPP, Equity Distribution Agreement or through other means, our stockholders may experience additional dilution, which could cause our stock price to fall.\nThe accounting method for the Deerfield Warrant and certain other warrants issued could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nThe Deerfield Warrant and certain other warrants we issued contain embedded derivatives, which require mark-to-market accounting treatment and could result in a gain or loss on a quarterly basis with regards to the mark-to-market value of that feature. Such accounting treatment could have a material impact on, and could potentially result in significant volatility in, our results of operations.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. If our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law and the terms of some or our contracts, might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our board of directors or management and, therefore, depress the price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our board of directors or our management. Therefore, these provisions could adversely affect the price of our stock. Our corporate governance documents include provisions:\n\u25cf\nestablishing a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u25cf\nproviding that directors may be removed by stockholders only for cause;\n\u25cf\npreventing the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings and to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n\u25cf\nrequiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors;\n\u25cf\npermitting the board of directors to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock with any rights, preferences and privileges they may designate;\n\u25cf\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u25cf\nproviding that vacancies may be filled by remaining directors;\n\u25cf\npreventing cumulative voting; and\n\u25cf\nproviding for a supermajority requirement to amend our bylaws.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, whi ch prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder.\nIn addition, the provisions of our termination agreement with Aquestive and the Deerfield Warrant may delay or prevent a change in control of our company. For example, if we enter into a merger, an asset sale or any other change of control transaction, then Aquestive will be entitled to a royalty equal to 10% of the price being paid to us and our stockholders in such transaction which is attributable to the value of AZSTARYS, KP484, KP879 or KP1077. Further, under the Deerfield Warrant, Deerfield has the right to demand that we redeem the Deerfield Warrant for a cash amount equal to the Black-Scholes value of a portion of the warrant upon the occurrence of specified events, including a merger, an asset sale or any other change of control transaction. A takeover of us may trigger the requirement that we repurchase the Deerfield Warrant, which could make it more costly for a potential acquirer to engage in a business combination transaction with us.\nAny provision of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws or Delaware law or any term of our contracts that has the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nIn addition, on and effective July 15, 2020, we amended and restated our bylaws, or the Bylaws, pursuant to which: (i) unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks subject matter jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware or, if and only if all such state courts lack subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: (A) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us; (B) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers or other employees, to us or our stockholders; (C) any action or proceeding asserting a claim against us or any of our current or former directors, officers or other employees, arising out of or pursuant to any provision of the DGCL our certificate of incorporation or our Bylaws (as each may be amended from time to time); (D) any action or proceeding to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or our Bylaws (including any right, obligation, or remedy thereunder); (E) any action or proceeding as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and (F) any action or proceeding asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees, governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court\u2019s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants, provided that this provision shall not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction; (ii) unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the federal district courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act; and (iii) any person or entity holding, owning or otherwise acquiring any interest in any security of us shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the provisions of the Bylaws.\nThese choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation or our Bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.\nWe might not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $233.3 million, due to prior period losses, $138.1 million of which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2027. These net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our profitability. These federal net operating loss carryforwards are fully reserved under a valuation allowance in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted H.R. 1, \u201cAn Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018\u201d (informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act). Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, U.S. federal net operating losses incurred in 2018 and in future years may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such federal net operating losses is limited. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses in the United States, unused losses will carry forward to offset future taxable income (subject to any applicable limitations), if any. In addition, under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u2018\u2018ownership change,\u2019\u2019 which is generally defined as a greater than 50% change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. We performed a Section 382 ownership change analysis in 2017 and determined that we experienced an ownership change in 2010, which resulted in a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards being subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 through 2012. No other ownership changes or limitations on our historical net operating loss carryforwards were noted through the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, we may have already experienced an ownership change, or may experience ownership changes in the future, as a result of shifts in our stock ownership, including as a result of the conversion of our outstanding convertible debt or as a result of changes in our stock ownership. If we determine that an ownership change has occurred and our ability to use our historical net operating loss carryforwards is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by increasing our future tax obligations. As of December 31, 2021, we maintain a full valuation allowance over our deferred tax assets for financial reporting purposes.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations.\nNew income, sales, use or other tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be enacted at any time, which could affect the tax treatment of our domestic earnings, if any. Any new taxes could adversely affect our business operations, and our business and financial performance. Further, existing tax laws, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us. For example, legislation enacted in 2017, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, significantly revised the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Future guidance from the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities with respect to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may affect us, and certain aspects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act could be repealed or modified in future legislation. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or any newly enacted federal tax legislation. Changes in corporate tax rates, the realization of net deferred tax assets relating to our operations, the taxation of foreign earnings, and the deductibility of expenses under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act or future reform legislation could have a material impact on the value of our deferred tax assets, could result in significant one-time charges, and could increase our future U.S. tax expense. The U.S. presidential administration and members of the U.S. Congress have proposed significant changes in U.S. federal income tax law, regulation and government policy within the United States, which could affect us and our business. For example, these proposals include significant changes to the U.S. federal income taxation of business entities including, among others, the imposition of minimum taxes or surtaxes on certain types of income. These proposals are being considered by the U.S. Congress, but the likelihood of these or other changes being enacted or implemented is unclear. We are currently unable to predict whether these or other changes will occur and, if so, the ultimate impact on our business. To the extent that such changes have a negative impact on us, including as a result of related uncertainty, these changes may materially and adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and regulations of the stock market on which our common stock is listed. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. For our fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, we performed system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We will be required to perform this evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis. This requires that we incur substantial additional professional fees and internal costs and that we expend significant management efforts on an annual basis. We have and will be required to test our internal control within a specified period, and, as a result, we may experience difficulty in meeting these reporting requirements.\nWe may discover weaknesses in our system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements. Our internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\nIf we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal control, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If that were to happen, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained and you may not be able to resell your shares of our common stock for a profit, if at all.\nAn active trading market for our shares may not be sustained. If an active market for our common stock is not sustained, it may be difficult for you to sell our shares at an attractive price, or at all.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports, or publish unfavorable research or reports, about us, our business or our market, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, our market and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gains and you may never receive a return on your investment.\nYou should not rely on an investment in our common stock to provide dividend income. We have not declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock to date. We currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nWe incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we incur significant additional legal, accounting and other costs. These additional costs could negatively affect our financial results. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC, may increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If, notwithstanding our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards, we fail to comply, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain some types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, on committees of our board of directors or as members of senior management.", "PERMNO": 15294, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "KMPH"}
