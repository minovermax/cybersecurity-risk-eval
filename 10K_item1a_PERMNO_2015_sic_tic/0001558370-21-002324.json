{"cik": "912767", "company": "UFP INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-03", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe may be impacted by a significant change in the value of the U.S. dollar. We purchase a variety of raw materials and finished goods from sources around the world and export certain products. The impact of a change in U.S. dollar exchange rates would impact our import purchases and export sales, which totaled $585.7 million and $116.8 million, respectively, in 2020. In addition, many of our industrial customers export their products.\nWe are subject to fluctuations in the price of lumber. We experience significant fluctuations in the cost of commodity lumber products from primary producers (the \"Lumber Market\"). A variety of factors over which we have no control, including government and environmental regulations, weather conditions, economic conditions, and natural disasters, impact the cost of lumber products and our selling prices. While we attempt to minimize our risk from severe price fluctuations, substantial, prolonged trends in lumber prices can affect our sales, cost of materials, and gross profits. Our products are generally priced to the customer based on a quoted, fixed selling price or \"indexed\" to the Lumber Market with a fixed dollar adder to cover conversion costs and profit. The impact on our profitability from changes in lumber prices is discussed in the \u201cHistorical Lumber Prices\u201d and \"Impact of the Lumber Market on Our Operating Results\" captions of our Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section under Item 7 of this Form 10-K. Our lumber costs, including plywood, as a percentage of net sales were 51.0%, 43.4%, and 51.5% in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nOur growth may be limited by the markets we serve, including our construction market which is highly cyclical. Our sales growth is dependent, in part, upon the growth of the markets we serve. If our markets do not achieve anticipated growth, or if we fail to maintain our market share, financial results could be impaired.\nA significant portion of our sales are concentrated with one customer. Our sales to The Home Depot comprised 24% of our total net sales in fiscal 2020 and 19% in 2019 and 2018.\nWe may be impacted by vertical integration strategies. In certain markets and product lines, our customers or vendors could pursue vertical integration strategies that could have an adverse effect on our sales. We strive to add value and be a low-cost producer while maintaining competitive pricing in each of our markets to mitigate this risk.\nWe may be impacted by industry capacity of products we supply. From time to time, we may experience excess capacity among suppliers of certain products in some of the markets we serve. Our selling prices and gross margins have been and are likely to continue to be impacted by industry excess capacity. Conversely, we may experience limited capacity among suppliers of certain products, for example, many of our suppliers reduced their manufacturing capacity in response to the anticipated reduction in demand from the recent COVID-19 pandemic, which in turn impacted our ability to fulfill all of our customers\u2019 orders. Our suppliers are currently taking actions to increase capacity to meet expectations of future demand.\nOur growth may be limited by our ability to make successful acquisitions. A key component of our growth strategy is to complete business combinations. Business combinations involve inherent risks, including assimilation and successfully managing growth. While we conduct extensive due diligence and have taken steps to ensure successful assimilation, factors beyond our control could influence the relative success of these acquisitions.\nWe may be adversely affected by the impact of environmental and safety regulations. We are subject to the requirements of federal, state, and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that we are at all times in complete compliance with all of these requirements. We have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental regulations. If additional laws and regulations are enacted, which restrict our ability to manufacture and market our products, including our treated lumber products, it could adversely affect our sales and profits. Changes in the interpretation of existing laws could also adversely impact our financial results.\nThe current version of federal health care legislation may significantly increase our costs. The federal health care legislation enacted in 2010 and future regulations called for under the legislation may have a significant cost implication for our company. Our health care costs totaled approximately $60.3 million, $69.1 million, and $69.2 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nSeasonality and weather conditions could adversely affect us. Some aspects of our business are seasonal in nature and results of operations vary from quarter to quarter. In addition, the majority of our products sold to the Retail and Construction markets are used or installed in outdoor construction applications; therefore, short-term sales volume, productivity and gross profits can be negatively affected by adverse weather conditions, particularly in our first and fourth quarters.\nInbound and outbound transportation costs represent a significant part of our cost structure. An increase in fuel and other operating expenses will significantly increase our costs. While we attempt to pass these costs along to our customers, there can be no assurance that they would agree to these price increases. Our total inbound and outbound transportation costs were approximately 9.2%, 9.5%, and 9.3% of net sales in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.\nNew alternatives may be developed to replace traditional treated wood products. The manufacturers of wood preservatives continue to develop new preservatives. While we believe treated products are reasonably priced relative to alternative products such as composites or vinyl, new alternatives may impact the sales of treated wood products. In addition, new preservatives could increase our cost of treating products in the future.\nCybersecurity breaches could interfere with operations. We rely upon information technology systems and network products and the secure operation of these systems and products. Despite security measures, these systems and products may be vulnerable to physical damage, hackers, computer viruses, or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees, vendors, or customers. We have experienced such events in the past and, although past events were immaterial, future events may occur and may be material.\nWe may be impacted by new tariffs and duties on U.S. imports and foreign export sales. Instability of established free trade agreements may lead to raw material and finished goods price volatility. An increase in foreign tariffs on U.S. goods could curtail our export sales to other countries which was approximately $116.8 million in 2020. Increased tariffs and duties on U.S. imports will increase pricing by adding duty cost, where the duty is sustainable in light of overall unit price, or otherwise constrain supply by eliminating historical production sources by country or commodity type with unsustainable duties. Our purchases that are impacted by foreign tariffs were approximately $585.7 million in 2020, including UFP\u2019s U.S. import of Canadian Softwood Lumber of approximately $266.1 million, which is the primary imported commodity. In addition, there is a risk that U.S. tariffs on imports and countering tariffs on U.S. exports could trigger broader international trade conflicts that could adversely impact our business.\nOur restructuring efforts may not be successful. Effective as of January 1, 2020, in connection with the change in the Company's name to UFP Industries, management implemented a significant change in its organizational and operating structure. For many years, the Company was managed primarily on a geographic basis. Under that structure, local plants operated on a somewhat autonomous basis, manufacturing and supplying customers based upon their respective expertise, capacity and local customer needs. Those plants reported through and were managed by their respective regions and via the regions their respective divisions. Beginning on January 1, 2020, the operational and organizational structure of the Company changed. As of that date, the Company's business is being managed through three business segments: retail, construction and industrial. The Company believes that this new organizational and management structure will provide significant benefits and foster a greater likelihood of continued growth and profitability. As part of that structure, the Company believes that it will be more efficient in allocating capital among its operations, will better understand the markets in which it serves and expedite the development and sale of new products and services. While the Company believes that the implementation of this change will result in improved financial performance, there are always meaningful risks associated with significant changes in which management and its workforce conducts its business. Those risks include the departure of management talent, disruptions in business practices and related inefficiencies.\nWe may be adversely affected by the impact of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic. Disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have an adverse impact on the Company's operations and financial results. These outbreaks may adversely impact our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19, as well as measures taken by governmental authorities and businesses to limit the spread of this virus, may result in an adverse change in customer demand and our sales, interfere with the ability of our employees and suppliers to perform and function in a manner consistent with targeted objectives and otherwise adversely impact the efficiency of our operations. This has caused, and may continue to cause, us to materially curtail certain segments, and could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations and cash flow.\nAdverse economic conditions and our customers\u2019 ability to operate may impact their ability to pay. This may result in higher write-offs of receivables than we normally experience. We continue to monitor our customers\u2019 business activities, payment patterns, and credit profiles carefully and make changes in our terms when necessary in response to this risk. As a result, our accounts receivable aging as of December 26, 2020 was approximately 92% current. Our bad debt expense as a percentage of sales was 0.02%, 0.09%, and 0.03%, in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. During the most difficult collection period of the Great Recession, from 2008 through 2010, our bad debt expense as a percentage of sales averaged 0.25%.", "PERMNO": 79878, "SIC": 2421, "TIC": "UFPI"}
