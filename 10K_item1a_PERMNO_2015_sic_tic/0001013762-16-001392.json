RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors and the other information included herein as well as the information included in other reports and filings made with the SEC before investing in our common stock. The following factors, as well as other factors affecting our operating results and financial condition, could cause our actual future results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, should they materialize, and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION\nWe have had losses in the past and may incur losses in the future.\nOur accumulated deficit is approximately $211 million as of December 31, 2015. We can give no assurances that we will be profitable in the future. We cannot assure you that we will sustain profitability or that we will not incur operating losses in the future.\nWe may not be able to execute our business plan due to a lack of cash from operations.\nWe anticipate that our cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our requirements over the next twelve months. In the event that cash flow from operations is less than anticipated and we are unable to secure additional funding to cover our expenses, in order to preserve cash, we may have to reduce expenditures and effect reductions in our corporate infrastructure, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue our current level of operations. No assurance can be given that if additional financing becomes necessary it will be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nOur operating results have significant fluctuations.\nIn addition to the variability resulting from the short-term nature of commitments from our customers, other factors contribute to significant periodic quarterly fluctuations in results of operations. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 the receipt and timing of orders and the timing of delivery of orders;\n\u00b7 the inability to adjust expense levels or delays in adjusting expense levels, in either case in response to lower than expected revenues or gross margins;\n\u00b7 the volume of orders relative to our manufacturing capacity;\n\u00b7 product introductions and market acceptance of new products or new generations of products;\n\u00b7 changes in cost and availability of labor and components;\n\u00b7 product mix;\n\u00b7 variation in operating expenses; regulatory requirements and changes in duties and tariffs;\n\u00b7 pricing and availability of competitive products and services; and\n\u00b7 changes, whether or not anticipated, in economic conditions.\nAccordingly, the results of any past periods should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nRISKS RELATED TO MANUFACTURING\nThe manufacture of active matrix OLED microdisplays continues to evolve as better methods are discovered and employed and therefore we may encounter manufacturing issues or delays.\nOurs is an evolving technology and we are pioneers in this active matrix OLED microdisplay manufacturing technique. As such, we cannot assure you that we will be able to produce our products in sufficient quantity and quality to maintain existing customers and attract new customers. In addition, we cannot assure you that we will not experience manufacturing problems which could result in delays in delivery of orders or product introductions.\nWe are dependent on a mostly non-redundant single manufacturing facility.\nWe currently have little equipment redundancy in our manufacturing facility. If we experience any significant disruption in the operation of our manufacturing facility or a serious failure of a critical piece of equipment, we may be unable to supply microdisplays to our customers in a timely manner. For this reason, some OEMs may also be reluctant to commit a broad line of products to our microdisplays without a second production facility in place. However, we try to maintain product inventory to fill the requirements under such circumstances. Interruptions in our manufacturing could be caused by manufacturing equipment problems, the introduction of new equipment into the manufacturing process or delays in the delivery of new manufacturing equipment. Lead-time for delivery, installation, testing, repair and maintenance of manufacturing equipment can be extensive. No assurance can be given that we will not lose potential sales or be unable to meet production orders due to production interruptions in our manufacturing line.\nWe rely on key sole source and limited source suppliers.\nWe depend on a number of sole source or limited source suppliers for certain raw materials, components, and services. These include circuit boards, graphic integrated circuits, passive components, materials and chemicals, and equipment support. We maintain several single-source supplier relationships, either because alternative sources are not available or because the relationship is advantageous to us due to performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity, or price considerations (or a combination thereof). Even where alternative sources of supply are available, qualification of the alternative suppliers and establishment of reliable supplies could result in delays and a possible loss of sales, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. We do not manufacture the silicon integrated circuits on which we incorporate our OLED technology. Instead, we provide the design layouts to a sole semiconductor contract manufacturer who manufactures the integrated circuits on silicon wafers. Our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of components and other materials or services on a timely basis could result in manufacturing delays, increased costs and ultimately in reduced or delayed sales or lost orders which could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Generally, we do not have long term contracts or written agreements with our source suppliers, but instead operate on the basis of short term purchase orders.\nOur results of operations, financial condition and business would be harmed if we were unable to balance customer demand and capacity.\nAs customer demand for our products changes, and as we enter new markets which may require higher volume mass production, we must be able to ramp up or adjust our production capacity to meet demand. We are continually taking steps to address our manufacturing capacity needs for our products. If we are not able to expand or if we increase our capacity too quickly, our prospects may be limited and our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted. If we experience delays or unforeseen costs associated with adjusting our capacity levels, we may not be able to achieve our financial targets. For some of our products, vendor lead times exceed our customers\u2019 required delivery time, causing us to order to forecast rather than order based on actual demand. Ordering raw material and building finished goods based on forecasts exposes us to numerous risks, including potential inability to service customer demand within an acceptable timeframe, holding excess inventory or having unabsorbed manufacturing overhead.\nVariations in our production yields impact our ability to reduce our costs and could cause our margins to decline and our operating results to suffer.\nAll of our products are manufactured using technologies that are highly complex. The number of usable items, or yield, from our production processes may fluctuate as a result of many factors, including but not limited to the following:\n\u00b7 variability in our process repeatability and control;\n\u00b7 contamination of the manufacturing environment or equipment;\n\u00b7 equipment failure, power outages, or variations in the manufacturing process;\n\u00b7 lack of consistency and adequate quality and quantity of piece parts and other raw materials;\n\u00b7 defects in packaging either within or without our control;\n\u00b7 any transitions or changes in our production process, planned or unplanned; and\n\u00b7 certain customer requirements outside of our normal specifications.\nWe could experience manufacturing interruptions, delays, or inefficiencies if we are unable to timely and reliably procure components from single-sourced suppliers.\nWe maintain several single-source supplier relationships, either because alternative sources are not available or because the relationship is advantageous due to performance, quality, support, delivery, capacity, or price considerations. If the supply of a critical single-source material or component is delayed or curtailed, we may not be able to ship the related product in desired quantities and in a timely manner. Even where alternative sources of supply are available, qualification of the alternative suppliers and establishment of reliable supplies could result in delays and a possible loss of sales, which would harm our operating results.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property and proprietary rights.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trade secret protection, licensing agreements and other arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary technologies. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our operating results. Patents may not be issued for our current patent applications, third parties may challenge, invalidate or circumvent any patent issued to us, unauthorized parties could obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, rights granted under patents issued to us may not afford us any competitive advantage, others may independently develop similar technology or design around our patents, and protection of our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain foreign countries. On April 30, 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court, in KSR International Co. vs. Teleflex, Inc., mandated a more expansive and flexible approach towards a determination as to whether a patent is obvious and invalid, which may make it more difficult for patent holders to secure or maintain existing patents. Any future infringement or other claims or prosecutions related to our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management's attention and resources, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Protection of intellectual property has historically been a large yearly expense for us. For a period prior to 2008, we were not in a financial position to properly protect all of our intellectual property, and may not be in a position to properly protect our position or stay ahead of competition in new research and the protecting of the resulting intellectual property.\nIn addition to patent protection, we also rely on trade secrets and other non-patented proprietary information relating to our product development and manufacturing activities. We try to protect this information through appropriate efforts to maintain its secrecy, including requiring employees and third parties to sign confidentiality agreements. We cannot be sure that these efforts will be successful or that the confidentiality agreements will not be breached. We also cannot be sure that we would have adequate remedies for any breach of such agreements or other misappropriation of our trade secrets or that our trade secrets and proprietary know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE MICRODISPLAY INDUSTRY\nThe commercial success of the microdisplay industry depends on the widespread market acceptance of microdisplay systems products.\nThe commercial market for microdisplays is still emerging. Our long-term success may depend on consumer acceptance of microdisplays as well as the success of the commercialization of the microdisplay market. As an OEM supplier, our customers\u2019 products must also be well accepted. At present, it is difficult to assess or predict with any assurance the potential size, timing and viability of market opportunities for our technology in this market.\nThe microdisplay systems business is intensely competitive.\nWe do business in intensely competitive markets that are characterized by rapid technological change, changes in market requirements and competition from both other suppliers and our potential OEM customers. Such markets are typically characterized by price erosion. This intense competition could result in pricing pressures, lower sales, reduced margins, and lower market share. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on a number of factors, both within and outside our control. We expect these factors to include the following:\n\u00b7 our success in designing, manufacturing and delivering expected new products, including those implementing new technologies on a timely basis;\n\u00b7 our ability to address the needs of our customers and the quality of our customer services;\n\u00b7 the quality, performance, reliability, features, ease of use and pricing of our products;\n\u00b7 successful expansion of our manufacturing capabilities;\n\u00b7 our efficiency of production, and ability to manufacture and ship products on time;\n\u00b7 the rate at which original equipment manufacturing customers incorporate our product solutions into their own products;\n\u00b7 the market acceptance of our customers' products; and\n\u00b7 product or technology introductions by our competitors.\nOur competitive position could be damaged if one or more potential OEM customers decide to manufacture their own microdisplays, using OLED or alternate technologies. In addition, our customers may be reluctant to rely on a relatively small company such as eMagin for a critical component. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competition, and the failure to do so would have a materially adverse effect upon our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe display industry may be subject to cyclical demand and overcapacity.\nOur business strategy is dependent on OEM manufacturers\u2019 building and selling products that incorporate our OLED displays as components into those products. Industry-wide fluctuations in demand could cause significant harm to our business. The OLED microdisplay sector may experience overcapacity if additional capacity comes on line which could lead to pricing pressures and a difficult market in which to sell our products.\nOur competitors have many advantages over us.\nAs the microdisplay market develops, we expect to experience intense competition from numerous domestic and foreign companies including well-established corporations possessing worldwide manufacturing and production facilities, greater name recognition, larger retail bases and significantly greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than us, as well as from emerging companies who may be subsidized by their governments. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competition, and the failure to do so would have a materially adverse effect upon our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur products are subject to lengthy OEM development periods.\nWe sell most of our microdisplays to OEMs who will incorporate them into products they sell. OEMs determine during their product development phase whether they will incorporate our products. The time elapsed between initial sampling of our products by OEMs, the custom design of our products to meet specific OEM product requirements, and the ultimate incorporation of our products into OEM consumer products is significant, often with a duration of between one and three years. If our products fail to meet our OEM customers' cost, performance or technical requirements or if unexpected technical challenges arise in the integration of our products into OEM consumer products, our operating results could be significantly and adversely affected. Long delays in achieving customer qualification and incorporation of our products could adversely affect our business.\nIn order to increase or maintain our profit margins we may have to continuously develop new products, product enhancements and new technologies.\nIn some markets, prices of established products tend to decline over time. In order to increase or maintain our profit margins over the long term, we believe that we will need to continuously develop new products, product enhancements and new technologies that will either slow price declines of our products or reduce the cost of producing and delivering our products. While we anticipate many opportunities to reduce production costs over time, there can be no assurance that these cost reduction plans will be successful, that we will have the resources to fund the expenditures necessary to implement certain cost-saving measures, or that our costs can be reduced as quickly as any reduction in unit prices. We may also attempt to offset the anticipated decrease in our average selling price by introducing new products with higher selling prices that may or may not offset price declines in more mature products. If we fail to do so, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nOur success depends on attracting and retaining highly skilled and qualified technical and consulting personnel.\nWe must hire highly skilled technical personnel as employees and as independent contractors in order to develop our products. The competition for skilled technical employees is intense and we may not be able to retain or recruit such personnel. We must compete with companies that possess greater financial and other resources than we do, and that may be more attractive to potential employees and contractors. To be competitive, we may have to increase the compensation, including salaries, bonuses, stock options and other fringe benefits, offered to employees in order to attract and retain such personnel. The costs of attracting and retaining new personnel may have a materially adverse effect on our business and our operating results.\nOur success depends in a large part on the continuing service of key personnel.\nChanges in management could have an adverse effect on our business. We are dependent upon the active participation of several key management personnel and will also need to recruit additional management in order to expand according to our business plan. The failure to attract and retain additional management or personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial performance.\nOur operating results are substantially dependent on the development and acceptance of new products and technology innovations.\nOur future success may depend on our ability to develop new and lower cost solutions for existing and new markets and for customers to accept those solutions. We must introduce new products in a timely and cost-efficient manner, and we must secure production orders for those products from our customers. The development of new products is a highly complex process, and we historically have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products. Some or all of those technologies or products may not successfully make the transition from the research and development lab. Even when we successfully complete a research and development effort with respect to a particular product or technology, it may fail to gain market acceptance. The successful development and introduction of these products depends on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u00b7 achievement of technology breakthroughs required to make commercially viable devices;\n\u00b7 the accuracy of our predictions of market requirements;\n\u00b7 acceptance of our new product designs;\n\u00b7 acceptance of new technology in certain markets;\n\u00b7 the availability of qualified research and development and product development personnel;\n\u00b7 our timely completion of product designs and development;\n\u00b7 our ability and available resources to expand sales;\n\u00b7 our ability to develop repeatable processes to manufacture new products in sufficient quantities and at low enough costs for commercial sales;\n\u00b7 our customers\u2019 ability to develop competitive products incorporating our products; and\n\u00b7 acceptance of our customers\u2019 products by the market.\nIf any of these or other factors become problematic, we may not be able to develop and introduce these new products in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nIf government agencies or companies discontinue or curtail their funding for our research and development programs our business may suffer.\nChanges in federal budget priorities could adversely affect our contract and display product revenue. Historically, government agencies have funded a significant part of our research and development activities. Our funding has the risk of being redirected to other programs when the government changes budget priorities, such as in time of war or for other reasons. Government contracts are also subject to the risk that the government agency may not appropriate and allocate all funding contemplated by the contract. In addition our government contracts generally permit the contracting authority to terminate the contract for the convenience of the government. The full value of the contracts would not be realized if they were prematurely terminated. We may be unable to incur sufficient allowable costs to generate the full estimated contract values. Furthermore, the research and development and product procurement contracts of the customers we supply may be similarly impacted. If the government funding is discontinued or reduced, our ability to develop or enhance products could be limited and our business results or operations and financial conditions could be adversely affected.\nOur business depends on new products and technologies.\nThe market for our products is characterized by rapid changes in product, design and manufacturing process technologies. Our success depends to a large extent on our ability to develop and manufacture new products and technologies to match the varying requirements of different customers in order to establish a competitive position and become profitable. Furthermore, we must adopt our products and processes to technological changes and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and timely basis. Our failure to accomplish any of the above could harm our business and operating results.\nWe generally do not have long-term contracts with our customers.\nOur business has primarily operated on the basis of short-term purchase orders. We receive some longer term purchase agreements, and procurement contracts, but we cannot guarantee that we will continue to do so. Our current purchase agreements can be cancelled or revised without penalty, depending on the circumstances. We plan production primarily on the basis of internally generated forecasts of demand based on communications with customers, and available industry data which makes it difficult to accurately forecast revenues. If we fail to accurately forecast operating results, our business may suffer and the market price of our shares may decline.\nOur business strategy may fail if we cannot continue to form strategic relationships with companies that manufacture and use products that could incorporate our active matrix OLED technology.\nOur prospects could be significantly affected by our ability to develop strategic alliances with OEMs for incorporation of our active matrix OLED microdisplay technology into their products. While we intend to continue to establish strategic relationships with manufacturers of electronic consumer products, personal computers, chipmakers, lens makers, equipment makers, material suppliers and/or systems assemblers, there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to establish and maintain strategic relationships on commercially acceptable terms, or that the alliances we do enter into will realize their objectives. Failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nOur business currently depends largely on our ability to manufacture and sell displays.\nAny interruption in our manufacturing processes or demand for our displays will negatively impact our business, including operations and financial condition.\nOur business depends to some extent on international transactions.\nWe purchase needed materials from companies located abroad and may be adversely affected by political and currency risk, as well as the additional costs of doing business with foreign entities. Some customers in other countries have longer receivable periods or warranty periods. In addition, many of the foreign OEMs that are the most likely long-term purchasers of our microdisplays expose us to additional political and currency risk. We may find it necessary to locate manufacturing facilities abroad to be closer to our customers which could expose us to various risks, including management of a multi-national organization, the complexities of complying with foreign laws and customs, political instability and the complexities of taxation in multiple jurisdictions.\nOur business may expose us to product liability claims.\nOur business may expose us to potential product liability claims. Although no such claims have been brought against us to date, and to our knowledge no such claim is threatened or likely, we may face liability to product users for damages resulting from the faulty design or manufacture of our products. While we plan to maintain product liability insurance coverage, there can be no assurance that product liability claims will not exceed coverage limits, fall outside the scope of such coverage, or that such insurance will continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates, if at all.\nOur business is subject to environmental regulations and possible liability arising from potential employee claims of exposure to harmful substances used in the development and manufacture of our products.\nWe are subject to various governmental regulations related to toxic, volatile, experimental and other hazardous chemicals used in our design and manufacturing process. Our failure to comply with these regulations could result in the imposition of fines or in the suspension or cessation of our operations. Compliance with these regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses. We develop, evaluate and utilize new chemical compounds in the manufacture of our products. While we attempt to ensure that our employees are protected from exposure to hazardous materials, we cannot assure you that potentially harmful exposure will not occur or that we will not be liable to employees as a result.\nSome of our business is subject to U.S. government procurement laws and regulations.\nWe must comply with certain laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of federal government contracts. These laws and regulations affect how we conduct business under our federal government contracts, including the business that we do as a subcontractor. In complying with these laws and regulations, we may incur additional costs, and non-compliance may lead to the assessment of fines and penalties, including contractual damages, or the loss of business.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to export laws and regulations.\nWe must comply with all applicable export control laws including the Export Administration Regulations (\u201cEAR\u201d) and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d). Certain of our products may be deemed to be controlled for export by the U.S. Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security under the EAR or by the U.S. State Department\u2019s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (\u201cDDTC\u201d) under the ITAR. We believe certain of our new products with both high brightness and high resolution will be classified as a defense articles and licenses from the DDTC will be required for exports. Failure to comply with these export control laws can lead to severe penalties, both civil and criminal, and can include debarment from contracting with the U.S. government.\nCurrent adverse economic conditions may adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe current economic conditions and market instability may affect our customers and suppliers. Any adverse financial or economic impact to our customers may impact their ability to pay timely, or result in their inability to pay. It may also impact their ability to fund future purchases, or increase the sales cycles which could lead to a reduction in revenue and accounts receivable. Our suppliers may increase their prices or may be unable to supply needed raw materials on a timely basis which could result in our inability to meet customers\u2019 demand or affect our gross margins. Our suppliers may, also, impose more stringent payment terms on us. The timing and nature of any recovery in the credit and financial markets remains uncertain, and there can be no assurance that market conditions will improve in the near future or that our results will not be materially and adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR STOCK\nThe substantial number of shares that are or will be eligible for sale could cause our common stock price to decline even if we are successful.\nSales of significant amounts of common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could materially affect the market price of our common stock. These sales might also make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-linked securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate. As of January 31, 2016, we have outstanding common shares of 29,550,170 plus (i) options to purchase 4,218,139 shares, (ii) warrants to purchase 2,600,000 shares and (iii) convertible preferred stock to acquire 7,545,333 shares of common stock. If a significant number of our outstanding options are exercised, our shareholders may experience a substantial dilution in their percentage ownership of our company.\nWe are subject to significant corporate regulation as a public company and failure to comply with all applicable regulations could subject us to liability or negatively affect our stock price.\nAs a publicly traded company, we are subject to a significant body of regulation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. While we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices in corporate governance and continue to update this program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements, we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations. For example, we cannot provide assurance that, in the future, our management will not find a material weakness in connection with its annual review of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We also cannot provide assurance that we could remediate any such weakness; our failure to do so would prevent our management from concluding that our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year is effective. If we fail to comply with any of these regulations, we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions, fines or other sanctions or litigation. If we must disclose any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our stock price could decline.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations. During our four most recently completed fiscal quarters, the closing price of our stock ranged from a low of $1.37 on December 29, 2015 to a high of $3.65 on February 26, 2015. The market price of our common stock in the future is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7 variations in our operating results and financial conditions;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated announcements of technical innovations, new product developments, or design wins by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 general conditions in the semiconductor and flat panel display industries; and\n\u00b7 worldwide economic and financial conditions.\nIn addition, the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market price for many technology companies and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. The broad market fluctuations and other factors may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nConcentration of ownership of our stock may enable one shareholder or a small number of shareholders to significantly influence matters requiring shareholder approval.\nAs of January 31, 2016, Stillwater Holdings LLC (f/k/a Stillwater LLC) owned approximately 18% of our outstanding voting stock, Flat Creek Fiduciary Management, as trustee of a trust which the sole member of Stillwater Holdings LLC has investment control, owned approximately 11% of our outstanding voting stock, Stillwater Trust LLC owned 4% of our outstanding voting stock and the sole member of Stillwater Holdings LLC is the investment manager of Rainbow Gate Corporation, which owned approximately 5% of our outstanding voting stock. Together such shareholders owned approximately 38% of our outstanding voting stock. As a result, these shareholders, if they act together, may be able to exert a significant degree of influence over matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Further, if these shareholders act together with another shareholder, Ginola Limited, which has common directors with Mount Union Corp., Chelsea Trust Company and Crestflower Corporation, as of January 31, 2016, they would collectively have represented approximately 46% of our outstanding voting stock. This concentration of ownership may facilitate or hinder a change of control and might affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other shareholders. Nevertheless, the ability to influence the election of the Board of Directors or otherwise have influence does not modify the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors to represent the interests of all shareholders.", "PERMNO": 87658, "SIC": 3679, "TIC": "EMAN"}
