Risk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, prospects and/or the trading price of our common stock. Although the risks and uncertainties listed below are those that we consider significant, material risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In evaluating our business and an investment in our securities, you should consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information presented in this report, as well as the other reports we file from time to with the SEC:\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe recent coronavirus outbreak could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and cash flows.\nConcerns are rapidly growing about the global outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d or \u201ccoronavirus\u201d). The virus has spread rapidly across the globe, including the U.S. The pandemic is having an unprecedented impact on the U.S. economy as federal, state and local governments react to this public health crisis, which has created significant uncertainties. These uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the potential adverse effect of the pandemic on the economy, our licensees, customer sentiment in general, and temporary closing of stores containing our brands. As the pandemic continues to grow, consumer fear about becoming ill with the virus and recommendations and/or mandates from federal, state and local authorities to avoid large gatherings of people or self-quarantine may continue to increase, which has already affected, and may continue to affect, retailers, as well as our licensees who sell to these retailers. We are unable to predict when retailers who have temporarily closed stores will reopen or if additional periods of store closures will be needed or mandated. Continued impacts of the pandemic could materially adversely affect our near-term and long-term revenues, earnings, liquidity and cash flows as our licensees may request temporary relief, delay or not make scheduled payments. COVID-19 is adversely impacting sales in the apparel and accessories industry. Diminished sales of products bearing our brands may have an adverse effect on the estimated fair value of our intangible assets, including our trademarks. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the spread of the outbreak within the U.S., the impact on capital and financial markets and the related impact on consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. This situation is changing rapidly, and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently. The potential impact of COVID-19 intensifies the business and operating risks that we face and should be considered when reading the additional risk factors below.\nNatural disasters, public health crises, political crises, and other catastrophic events or other events outside of our control may damage the facilities of our licensees on which we depend and could impact consumer spending.\nIf any of our licensees facilities, including manufacturing, finishing or distribution facilities, or the facilities of our suppliers, third-party service providers, or customers, is affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis, power shortages or outages, floods or monsoons, public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, political crises, such as terrorism, war, political instability or other conflict, or other events outside of our control, it could have an adverse effect on our business. Disasters occurring at our licensees\u2019 facilities also could impact our reputation and our consumers\u2019 perception of our brands. Moreover, these types of events could negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or depending upon the severity, globally, which could adversely impact our results of operations. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak originating in Wuhan, China to be a global pandemic.\nCertain licensees have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by the coronavirus outbreak due to manufacturing facility closures, store closures and a decrease in consumer traffic. Although the coronavirus outbreak is an ongoing phenomenon with uncertain scale, to date the outbreak has had severe global macroeconomic and financial market impacts. The impact of the coronavirus on consumer demand and on our results of operations remain uncertain; however, such impacts may be significant.\nThe failure of our licensees to fulfill their financial obligations with respect to royalty payments under their license agreements or to otherwise adequately produce, market and sell products bearing our brand names in their license categories could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revenues are almost entirely dependent on royalty payments made to us pursuant to license agreements entered into with licensees of our brands. These license agreements often require that licensees advance payment to us of a portion of the sales royalty payments due thereunder and, in most cases, provide for guaranteed minimum royalty payments. The failure of our licensees to satisfy their financial obligations under these agreements, or their inability to operate successfully or at all, could result in a breach of an agreement, early termination of an agreement, non-renewal of an agreement or an amendment of an agreement to reduce the guaranteed minimum royalty payments or sales royalties due thereunder, each of which could eliminate some or all of that revenue stream. A decrease or elimination of revenue could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDuring the term of a license agreement, our revenues and the value of our brands substantially depend upon our licensees\u2019 ability to maintain the quality and marketability and market acceptance of the branded products licensed to such licensee and their failure to do so could negatively affect consumer perception of our brands and harm our future growth and prospects. Further, the failure of our licensees to meet their production, manufacturing and distribution requirements, or a weak economy or softness in the retail, apparel or home goods sectors, could cause our licensees to default on their obligations to make guaranteed minimum royalty payments to us or cause a decline in their sales and potentially decrease the amount of royalty payments in excess of guaranteed minimum royalty payments due to us. In addition, our licensees\u2019 inability to maintain market acceptance of our brands or our failure to monitor our licensees\u2019 compliance with their license agreements or take appropriate corrective action when necessary may subject our intellectual property assets to cancellation, loss of rights or devaluation and any devaluation of our trademarks or other intellectual property could cause a material impairment in the carrying value of such intellectual property, potentially resulting in a charge as an expense to our results of operations. If such developments occur or our licensees are otherwise not successful, the value and recognition of our brands, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations, could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business depends on continued market acceptance of our brands and the products bearing these brands.\nThe retail industry is highly susceptible to changes in consumer preferences and continued market acceptance of our brands and our licensees\u2019 products, as well as market acceptance of any future products bearing our brands and is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. In order to generate revenues and profits, our licensees must develop product offerings that appeal to consumers. We retain rights to monitor the products our licensees\u2019 design and produce and may retain the right to preview and approve such products, we cannot assure you that licensees will develop, market and sell products that appeal to consumers. Any significant changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our licensees\u2019 part to anticipate or react to such changes could reduce demand for our branded products and erode the competitiveness of such products, which would negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe continued success of our brands and branded products and market acceptance of new products and product categories also depend on our ability to continually improve the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. We devote significant resources and expenditures to promoting our brands and new product launches, but there can be no assurance as to our continued ability to effectively execute our marketing programs. To the extent our licensees misjudge the market for our brands and branded products, or our marketing efforts are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected.\nWe have incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness in connection with our acquisitions, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding net indebtedness of $446.0 million, as described more fully in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOur high level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of such indebtedness. In addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents that govern our indebtedness. If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service debt, would increase.\nOur increased level of indebtedness could have other important consequences, which include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\na substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be required to pay principal and interest on our debt;\n\u00b7\nour interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because our borrowings generally bear interest at floating rates;\n\u00b7\nour leverage could increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions, placing us at a disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that are less leveraged;\n\u00b7\nour debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in the brand licensing industry;\n\u00b7\nour failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, results in foreclosure on substantially all of our assets; and\n\u00b7\nour level of debt may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and other general corporate requirements.\nWe cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations. In particular, we do not know at this time what the effects will be of the coronavirus pandemic, including the effects of our licensees requesting delaying payments or failing to make payments to us. If we do not have sufficient earnings, we may be required to seek to refinance all or part of our then existing debt, sell assets, make additional borrowings or sell more securities, none of which we can guarantee that we will be able to do and which, if accomplished, may adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to a number of restrictive covenants under our debt arrangements, including customary operating restrictions and customary financial covenants. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain compliance with such covenants.\nOur outstanding debt is generally guaranteed jointly and severally by each of our domestic subsidiaries. Our and our subsidiaries\u2019 obligations under the Debt Facilities (as defined in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements) and the associated guarantees are secured, in each case, by first priority liens (subject, in the case of the Amended KKR Credit Agreement, to the liens under the Amended BoA Credit Agreement on, and security interests in, substantially all of the present and after acquired assets of us and each of our subsidiaries, subject to certain customary exceptions). The Debt Facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants, representations and warranties, including representations relating to the intellectual property owned by us and our subsidiaries and the status of our material license agreements. In addition,\nthe Debt Facilities include covenants and events of default, including, in the case of the Amended BoA Credit Agreement, requirements that we (i) maintain a positive net income (as defined), (ii) satisfy a maximum loan to value ratio (as calculated pursuant to the Amended BoA Credit Agreement) and (iii) satisfy a maximum consolidated first lien leverage ratio (as calculated pursuant to the Amended BoA Credit Amendment), and, in the case of the Amended KKR Credit Agreement, to satisfy (i) a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio (as calculated pursuant to the Amended KKR Credit Agreement) and (ii) a maximum consolidated first lien leverage ratio (as calculated pursuant to the Amended KKR Credit Agreement).\nIf our business, financial condition or results of operations are adversely affected by one or more of the risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere in our filings with the SEC, including by the effect of coronavirus, we may be unable to maintain compliance with these financial covenants. If we fail to comply with such covenants, our lenders could demand immediate payment of amounts outstanding. Under such circumstances, we would need to seek alternative financing sources to fund our ongoing operations and to repay amounts outstanding and satisfy our other obligations under our existing borrowing and financing arrangements. Such financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Consequently, we may be restricted in how we fund ongoing operations and strategic initiatives and deploy capital and in our ability to make acquisitions. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be further adversely affected if we are unable to maintain compliance with our debt covenants.\nWe or our licensees may not be able to continue to compete successfully because of intense competition within our licensees\u2019 markets, the strength of some of their competitors or other factors.\nOur trademark licenses are for products primarily in the apparel, footwear, fashion and home accessories markets, in which our licensees face intense competition. Competitive factors in these markets include design, quality, price, style, name recognition, service and advertising. Changing customer preferences and the limited availability of shelf space can adversely affect the competitive position of our licensees\u2019 products. Many of our licensees\u2019 competitors have greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than our licensees and have achieved significant name recognition for their brands. Our licensees may be unable to successfully compete in the markets for their products, which would adversely affect our revenues and cash flows, and we may not be able to continue to compete successfully with respect to our licensing arrangements.\nWe and our licensees are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to operating outside of the United States, foreign manufacturing and the price, availability and quality of raw materials, which could result in interruptions to their operations or increase their operating costs, thereby affecting their ability to deliver goods to the market, reducing or delaying their sales and decreasing our revenues.\nWe market and license our brands outside the United States, and many of our licensees operate outside the United States. We face numerous risks in doing business outside the United States, including: (i) unusual or burdensome foreign laws or regulatory requirements or unexpected changes to those laws or requirements\u037e (ii) tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargoes, sanctions and other trade barriers\u037e (iii) competition from foreign companies\u037e (iv) less effective and less predictable protection and enforcement of our intellectual property\u037e (v) changes in the political or economic condition of a specific country or region (including, without limitation, as a result of political unrest), particularly in emerging markets\u037e (vi) fluctuations in the value of foreign currency versus the U.S. dollar and the cost of currency exchange\u037e (vii) potentially adverse tax consequences\u037e and (viii) cultural differences in the conduct of business. Any one or more of such factors could impact current or future international sales of our brands or inhibit our ability to expand internationally. In addition, our business practices in international markets are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and all other applicable anti-bribery laws, any violation of which could subject us to significant fines, criminal sanctions and other penalties.\nFurther, a significant portion of the products sold by our licensees are manufactured overseas. There are substantial risks associated with foreign manufacturing, including (i) changes in laws relating to quotas, and the payment of tariffs and duties, (ii) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, (iii) shipping delays and (iv) international political, regulatory and economic developments. Further, our licensees may experience fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of fabrics and raw materials used by them in their manufactured apparel or purchased finished goods. Any of these risks could increase our licensees\u2019 operating costs. Our licensees also import finished products and\nassume all risk of loss and damage with respect to these goods once they are shipped by their suppliers. If these goods are destroyed or damaged during shipment, the revenues of our licensees could be reduced as a result of our licensees\u2019 inability to deliver or their delay in delivering their products. A reduction in the revenues generated by our licensees would reduce the amount of our royalty revenues in excess of guaranteed minimum royalty payments and, in extreme circumstances, result in failures to make guaranteed minimum royalty payments to us.\nA substantial portion of our licensing revenue is concentrated with a limited number of licensees and retail partners, such that the loss of a licensee or retail partner could materially decrease our revenue and cash flows.\nOur licensing revenues are concentrated with a limited number of licensees and retail partners. During the year ended December 31, 2019, three licensees represented at least 10% of net revenue, accounting for 19%, 16% and 14% of the Company\u2019s net revenue from continuing operations. During the year ended December 31, 2018, three licensees represented at least 10% of net revenue, accounting for 18%, 12% and 11% of the Company\u2019s net revenue from continuing operations. Our revenue and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected if any of them were to have financial difficulties affecting their ability to make payments, elected not to renew or extend any existing license agreements or arrangements with us or significantly reduced their sales of these licensed products under any of these license agreements or arrangements, and we were not able to replace the revenue generated by such licensees.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could compromise our competitive position and decrease the value of our brands.\nWe own, through our subsidiaries, U.S. federal trademark registrations and foreign trademark registrations for our brands that are vital to the success and further growth of our business. In addition, we own domestic, foreign and international intellectual property registrations for the technology and designs incorporated into Heelys wheeled footwear and Gaiam yoga products. The loss of or inability to enforce our proprietary rights could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. For instance, if any third party independently develops similar products to those marketed and distributed by our licensees or manufactures knock-offs of such products, it may harm the reputation of our brands, decrease their value or cause a decline in our licensees\u2019 sales and thus our revenues. Additionally, the laws of foreign countries may provide inadequate protection for intellectual property rights, making it difficult to enforce such rights in those countries.\nWe may need to bring legal claims to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights. Any litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and diversions of resources and negatively impact our business operations. In addition, notwithstanding the rights we have secured in our intellectual property, third parties may bring claims against us or our licensees alleging that we or our licensees have infringed on their intellectual property rights or that our or our licensees\u2019 intellectual property rights are not valid. Any claims against us or our licensees, with or without merit, could be time consuming and costly to defend or litigate and therefore could adversely affect our business. In addition, to the extent that any of our intellectual property assets is deemed to violate the proprietary rights of third parties in any litigation or proceeding or as a result of any claim, then we and our licensees may be prevented from using it, which could cause a breach or termination of license agreements. If our licensees are prevented from using the intellectual property we have licensed to them, the revenues of our licensees will be reduced with respect to those intellectual property assets, and the related royalty payments we receive could be reduced. Litigation with respect to our intellectual property or breaches of our license agreements could result in a judgment or monetary damages.\nWe depend upon the services of our key executives, including our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. David Conn. If we lose the services of Mr. David Conn or other key executives, we may not be able to fully implement our business plan and future growth strategy, which would harm our business and prospects.\nOur success is largely dependent upon the expertise and knowledge of our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. David Conn, and other key members of the executive team, whom we rely upon to formulate our business strategies. Our key executives\u2019 leadership and experience in the licensing industry is important to the successful implementation of our business and marketing strategy. We do not carry key person life insurance covering our key executives. The loss of the services of our key executives could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate significantly, which may make it difficult to predict our performance and result in volatility in our stock price.\nWe have in the past experienced substantial variations in our revenue and results of operations from quarter to quarter, and we expect to continue to experience such substantial variations. This variability is affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe timing of the introduction of new licensed products by our licensees;\n\u00b7\nthe level of consumer acceptance of our brands and licensed products;\n\u00b7\nseasonality resulting in higher revenues in the second half of the year;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic and industry conditions that affect consumer spending and retailer purchasing;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of viable licensees that meet our brand criteria; and\n\u00b7\nthe timing of marketing expenditures.\nBecause of these fluctuations in our revenues, operating expenses and cash flows it may be difficult to make period-to-period comparisons of our result of operations and liquidity and it may be difficult for securities analysts and investors to predict our performance. As a result, our results of operations in any particular quarter may be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. Fluctuations in our performance and the failure to meet analyst expectations could cause declines or volatility in our stock price.\nDemand for our brands and branded products may be materially and adversely affected by reductions in disposable income, which in turn depends on general economic conditions and the global economy.\nOur performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending that affect not only the ultimate consumer, but also retailers and distributors, who license our brands. Consumer spending has fluctuated significantly and may become depressed or be subject to deterioration in the near future. The worldwide apparel and consumer products industries are heavily influenced by general economic cycles. Purchases of apparel, footwear and accessories tend to decline in periods of recession or uncertainty regarding future economic prospects, as disposable income declines. During periods of recession or economic uncertainty, our licensees may not be able to maintain or increase sales of our branded products to existing customers, make sales to new customers, open or operate new retail stores or maintain sales levels at existing stores as consumers may shift discretionary income spending to other areas other than our licensee\u2019s products. As a result, our results of operations may be adversely and materially affected by downward trends in the United States or global economy.\nThe market price of our common stock has declined significantly and may be volatile, which could reduce the demand for our common stock.\nThe publicly traded shares of our common stock have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant price fluctuations, ranging between $2.48 and $0.22 during our last two fiscal years. Due to the continued, sustained decline in our stock price during 2017, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $304.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our goodwill impairment. Future decreases or volatility in our stock price could reduce demand for our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. The trading price of our common stock could also change significantly over short periods of time in response to write-downs or actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations, announcements by us, our licensees or our respective competitors, factors affecting our licensees\u2019 markets generally or changes in national or regional economic conditions.\nOur largest stockholders control a significant percentage of our common stock and are represented on our board of directors, which may enable such stockholders, alone or together with our other significant stockholders, to exert influence over corporate transactions and other matters affecting the rights of our stockholders.\nAs of March 23, 2020, Tengram Capital Partners Gen2 Fund, L.P. (\u201cTengram\u201d) beneficially owns approximately 11.6%, Carlyle Galaxy Holdings, L.P. (\u201cCarlyle\u201d) beneficially owns approximately 9.7% and Ms. Martha Stewart beneficially owns approximately 12.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Mr. William Sweedler, chairman of our board of directors, is a principal of Tengram and Ms. Martha Stewart became a director in connection with the closing of the Mergers and remained a director post the sale of MSLO. As a result, each of Tengram, Carlyle and Ms. Martha Stewart, individually or collectively, are able to exercise substantial influence over our board of directors and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate actions, such as mergers and other business combination transactions.\nCircumstances may occur in which the interests of these stockholders could conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. The voting power of these stockholders also could discourage others from seeking to acquire control of us, which may reduce the market price of our common stock.\nWe may be deemed a former shell company and therefore resales of shares of our restricted common stock in reliance on Rule 144 may be subject to additional requirements and Rule 144 may be unavailable at all if we fail to comply with our reporting obligations.\nFrom time to time we have issued shares of our common stock in transactions exempt from registration requirements, and such shares are \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of Rule 144. Rule 144 generally permits the resale, subject to various terms and conditions, of restricted securities after they have been held for six months. However, one of our predecessors was a former shell company and, as a result, securities laws also might deem us to be a former shell company. If we are deemed a former shell company, Rule 144 may be unavailable for resales of our restricted common stock unless we have satisfied certain reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), for the twelve months preceding the time of sale. However, we cannot assure you that future reports or other materials will be filed as necessary to maintain the availability of the exemption under Rule 144. If we are deemed a former shell company and we fail to comply with our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, Rule 144 will be unavailable to holders of our restricted common stock, which may limit the holders\u2019 ability to sell such restricted shares. In addition, because of the on-going reporting requirements under Rule 144, restrictive legends on certificates for shares of our common stock cannot be removed except in connection with an actual sale that is subject to an effective registration statement under, or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of, the Securities Act.\nWhile we audit our licensees from time to time in the ordinary course, we otherwise rely on the accuracy of our licensees\u2019 retail sales reports for reporting and collecting our revenues, and if these reports are untimely or incorrect, our revenue could be delayed or inaccurately reported.\nUnder our existing agreements, our licensees pay us licensing fees based in part on the retail value of products sold. We rely on our licensees to accurately report the retail sales in collecting our license fees, preparing our financial reports, projections, budgets, and directing our sales and marketing efforts. Our license agreements permit us to audit our licensees. If any of our licensee reports understate the retail sales of products they sell, we may not collect and recognize revenue to which we are entitled, or may endure significant expense to obtain compliance.\nWe do not foresee paying dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future. Instead, we plan to retain any earnings to maintain and expand our existing licensing operations, further develop our brands and finance the acquisition of additional brands.\nWe have a significant amount of intangible assets, including our trademarks, recorded on our balance sheet. As a result of changes in market conditions and declines in the estimated fair value of these assets, we have been required to write-down all of our goodwill and a portion of our other intangible assets and may be required to record impairments of our intangible assets in the future which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, intangible assets represented $600 million, or 82.9% of our total consolidated assets. Under current accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d), indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead are subject to impairment evaluation based on related estimated fair values, with such testing to be done at least annually. Our trademarks are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Any write-down of intangible assets resulting from future periodic evaluations would, as applicable, either decrease our net income or increase our net loss and those decreases or increases could be material. We recorded non-cash impairment charges of $33.1 million and $17.9 million for indefinite-lived intangible assets for certain brands in the third quarter of 2019 and 2018, respectively; the impairments arose due to reduced growth expectations and the impact of licensee transitions for these brands. Due to the continued, sustained decline in our stock price, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $304.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. See Note 7 and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these impairment charges.\nOur use of certain tax attributes may be limited.\nWe have significant net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d). A valuation allowance has been provided as of December 31, 2019 which primarily relates to state net operating losses and capital loss carryforwards. As of December 31, 2019, we have federal NOLs available to carryforward to future periods of $107.8 million which begin expiring in 2029 and we have state NOLs available to carryforward to future periods of $179 million which begin expiring in 2020. We have foreign tax credits available to carryforward to future periods of $0.5 million as of December 31, 2019 which begin expiring in 2020. We have experienced several changes of ownership under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) which place various limitations on the use of NOLs. The limitation on NOLs is based upon a formula provided under Section 382 of the Code that utilizes the fair market value of us and prevailing interest rates at the time of the ownership change. An \u201cownership change\u201d is generally a 50% increase in ownership over a three-year period by stockholders who directly or indirectly own at least five percent of a company\u2019s stock. The limitations on the use of the NOLs under Section 382 could affect our ability to offset future taxable income.\nWe may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business, which could affect our financial position and liquidity.\nFrom time to time, we may be made a party to litigation in the normal course of business. For example, as the owner of a trademark, we may be named as a defendant in a lawsuit relating to a product designed and manufactured by a licensee of that trademark. If we are alleged to have infringed the intellectual property rights of another party, any resulting litigation could be costly and could damage our reputation. Litigation also diverts the time and resources of management, regardless of the merits of the claim. In most cases, our licensees under the existing license agreements are obligated to defend and indemnify us, as licensor, and our affiliates with respect to such litigation. We also maintain insurance for certain risks, but it is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all possible liabilities. Although historically the litigation involving us has not been material to our financial position or our liquidity, any litigation has an element of uncertainty and if any such litigation were to be adversely determined and/or a licensee were to fail to properly indemnify us and/or we did not have appropriate insurance coverage, such litigation could affect our financial position and liquidity.\nBecause the bid price of our ordinary shares is below the minimum requirement for the Nasdaq Capital Market, we cannot assure you that our common stock will continue to trade on that market or another national securities exchange.\nOn June 5, 2019, we received a notice from Nasdaq Stock Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) stating that, for the prior 30 consecutive trading days, the closing bid price for our common stock was below the minimum of $1.00 per share required for continued listing on the exchange. The notification letter stated that we would be afforded 180 calendar days, or until December 2, 2019, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. In order to regain compliance with the listing standards, the closing bid price for our common stock must be at least $1.00 for 10 consecutive trading days. We have considered our available options to regain compliance, including whether to effect a reverse stock split. We cannot assure you about whether we will be able to regain compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements. If we are unable to do\nso and our common stock is no longer listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange, the liquidity and market price of our common stock may be adversely affected. On February 11, 2020, the stockholders approved the vote to effect a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock at a ratio of 1 share-for-10 shares up to a ratio of 1 share-for-40 shares, to be determined by our Board of Directors.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer in the event of security breaches, cyber-attacks or unauthorized disclosures of personal information.\nIn conducting their business, including their e-commerce business, our licensees and retail partners obtain and transmit confidential information about their customers, including credit card information, through their websites and their information technology systems. If our licensees or retail partners experience such a security breach or cyber-attack, it could adversely affect their business and operations, including damaging their reputation and their relationships with their customers, exposing them to risks of litigation and liability including under data privacy laws and regulations, all of which could have a material adverse effect on their ability to meet their minimum net sales requirements and to make guaranteed minimum royalty payments to us in accordance with the terms of their respective license agreements. We cannot assure you that our licensees and retail partners will not experience any future security breaches, cyber-attacks or unauthorized disclosures. In addition, as a result of recent security breaches at a number of prominent retailers, the media and public scrutiny of information security and privacy has become more intense and the regulatory environment has become more uncertain. As a result, our licensees and retail partners may incur significant costs to comply with laws regarding the protection and unauthorized disclosure of personal information, which could also negatively affect their ability to generate sales and make royalty payments to us, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our strategic review.\nOn October 7, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors has initiated a broad review of strategic alternatives focused on maximizing shareholder value. Such strategic alternatives may include the divestiture of one or more existing brands, the acquisition of one or more new brands, a stock buyback program, and other initiatives. We also announced that the Board had engaged Stifel to serve as financial advisor to assist in this process. We cannot assure you that the review of strategic alternatives will result in any transaction, and the process of exploring strategic alternatives will involve the dedication of significant resources and the incurrence of significant costs and expenses. In addition, speculation and uncertainty regarding the strategic review process may cause or result in disruption of our business; distraction of our employees; difficulty in recruiting, hiring, motivating, and retaining talented and skilled personnel; difficulty in maintaining or negotiating and consummating new business or strategic relationships or transactions; and increased stock price volatility. If we are unable to mitigate these or other potential risks related to the uncertainty caused by the strategic review process, it may adversely affect our business or adversely impact our net sales, operating results, and financial condition.\nChanges in the U.S. trade environment, including the imposition of import tariffs, could adversely affect the amount or timing of our revenues, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe U.S. government has proposed, and in some case, implemented new or higher tariffs on specified imported products, and certain governments have responded by proposing new or higher tariffs on specified products imported from the United States (including, but not limited to, the Trump Administration's tariffs on China and China's retaliatory tariffs on certain products from the U.S.). These tariffs, which do not apply directly to our branding business, may materially and adversely affect our licensees by imposing tariffs on goods they import. The imposition of tariffs may negatively affect key licensees or the suppliers, manufacturers and customers of goods produced under our trademarks. For example, tariffs may result in or have resulted in increasing our licensees\u2019 costs to produce goods and decrease their sales and gross margins and demand for their products. Such outcomes could adversely affect the amount or timing of our revenues, results of operations or cash flows, and continuing uncertainty about changes in the U.S. trade environment could cause our licensees to experience sales volatility, price fluctuations or supply shortages or advances or delays in the manufacture and sale of products produced under our trademarks.\nChanges in the method for determining LIBOR and the potential replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate could increase our borrowing costs.\nSome of our borrowings bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR. In July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), a regulator of financial services firms and financial markets in the United Kingdom, stated that it will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of LIBOR interest rates indices. The FCA has indicated they will support the LIBOR indices through 2021, to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its recommended alternative to LIBOR, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in April 2018. SOFR is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities.\nWe are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, including the possibility of SOFR as the dominant replacement. Introduction of an alternative rate also may introduce additional basis risk for market participants as an alternative index is utilized along with LIBOR. There can be no guarantee that SOFR will become widely used and that alternatives may or may not be developed with additional complications. We are not able to predict whether LIBOR will cease to be available after 2021, whether SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR, or what the impact of such a possible transition to SOFR may have on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Acquisitions\nIf we are unable to identify and successfully acquire additional brands or to finance the acquisition of such brands, our rate of growth may be reduced and, even if additional trademarks are acquired, we may not realize anticipated benefits due to integration or licensing difficulties.\nA key component of our growth strategy is the acquisition of additional brands. In 2016, we acquired GAIAM, and in 2015, we acquired Jessica Simpson and Joe\u2019s and are continually exploring new acquisition opportunities. However, we face extensive competition for new brand acquisitions, both from other brand management companies as well as traditional consumer brand companies, retailers and private equity groups, which could increase the price of the acquisitions and make it more difficult for us to find suitable acquisition targets. In addition, even if we successfully acquire additional brands or the rights to use additional brands, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability levels that justify our investment in, or realize planned benefits with respect to, those additional brands.\nAlthough we seek to temper our acquisition risks, all acquisitions, whether they are of additional intellectual property assets or of the companies that own them, entail numerous risks, any of which could detrimentally affect our results of operations and/or the value of our equity. These risks include, among others:\n\u00b7\nunanticipated costs associated with the target acquisition;\n\u00b7\nnegative effects on reported results of operations from acquisition related charges and amortization of acquired intangibles;\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u00b7\nthe challenges of maintaining focus on, and continuing to execute, core strategies and business plans as our brand and license portfolio grows and becomes more diversified;\n\u00b7\ninability to find suitable licensees for our newly acquired brands;\n\u00b7\nadverse effects on our existing licensing relationships, including our existing licensees terminating their license agreements with us;\n\u00b7\npotential difficulties associated with the retention of key employees and the assimilation of any other employees, who may be retained by us in connection with or as a result of our acquisitions; and\n\u00b7\nrisks of entering new domestic and international markets (whether it be with respect to new licensed product categories or new licensed product distribution channels) or markets in which we have limited prior experience.\nIn the event we acquire intellectual property assets or the companies that own them, our due diligence reviews are subject to inherent uncertainties and may not reveal all potential risks. We may therefore fail to discover or inaccurately assess undisclosed or contingent liabilities, including liabilities for which we may have responsibility as a successor to the seller or the target company. In addition, as a successor, we may be responsible for any past or continuing violations of law by the seller or the target company. Although we generally attempt to seek contractual protections through representations, warranties and indemnities, we cannot be sure that we will obtain such provisions in our acquisitions or that such provisions will fully protect us from all unknown, contingent or other liabilities or costs. Finally, claims against us relating to any acquisition may necessitate our seeking claims against the seller for which the seller may not, or may not be able to, indemnify us or that may exceed the scope, duration or amount of the seller\u2019s indemnification obligations.\nAcquiring additional brands could also have a significant effect on our financial condition and could cause substantial fluctuations in our liquidity, cash balances and quarterly and yearly results of operations. Acquisitions could result in the recording of significant goodwill and intangible assets on our financial statements, the amortization or impairment of which would reduce our reported earnings in subsequent years. We cannot make assurances with respect to the timing, likelihood or financial or business effect of any possible transaction. Moreover, our ability to grow through the acquisition of additional brands will also depend on the availability of capital to complete the necessary acquisition arrangements. We may elect to pursue acquisitions through debt financing or the issuance of shares of our common stock or convertible securities. The use of equity as transaction consideration could dilute our common stock, reduce our earnings per share or reduce the market price of our common stock. We cannot guarantee that our stockholders will achieve greater returns as a result of any future acquisitions we complete.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions depends, to a large extent, on our ability to implement changes to acquired businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes anticipated synergies. We will be required to devote significant management attention, resources and costs to realigning the business practices and operations of acquired businesses to our brand management model. We generally expect to benefit from operational synergies from our acquisitions resulting from the consolidation of capabilities and elimination of redundancies, as well as greater efficiencies from increased scale and market integration. However, this process may preclude or impede realization of the benefits expected from acquisitions and could adversely affect current revenues and investments in future growth, which could adversely affect our results of operations. We cannot be certain that we will not be required to implement further realignment activities, make additions or other changes to our workforce based on other cost reduction measures or changes in the markets and industry in which we compete. In addition, future business conditions and events may impact our ability to continue to realize any benefits of these initiatives. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\nThe failure to successfully integrate new businesses and operations as a result of acquisitions may adversely affect our future results.\nBusinesses that we have acquired or may acquire in the future have operated historically as independent companies. We may face significant challenges in consolidating certain businesses and functions of these businesses, integrating their organizations, procedures, policies and operations, addressing differences in the business cultures and retaining key personnel. The integration process and other disruptions resulting from the business combinations mentioned above may also disrupt each company\u2019s ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our relationships with employees, business partners, customers and others with whom\nwe have business or other dealings, or limit our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions. In addition, difficulties in integrating the businesses mentioned above could harm our reputation.\nIf we are not able to successfully combine our businesses in an efficient, effective and timely manner, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisitions may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of our common stock may be affected adversely.\nOur success depends in part on the continued success of our celebrity based brands and the reputation and popularity of those celebrities. Any adverse reactions to publicity relating to those celebrities, or the loss of their services, could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations as well as our ability to maintain or generate a consumer base.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our celebrity based brands is important to our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our celebrity based brands may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including the reputation of its content and products, the uniqueness and relevance of celebrity branded content, and the reputation and popularity of those celebrities. If we fail to maintain and enhance these brands, or if excessive expenses are incurred in an effort to do so, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nMoreover, we believe our celebrities\u2019 image, reputation, popularity and talent are material to the success of their brand. Any repeated or sustained negative shifts in public or industry perceptions of such celebrities could have a material adverse effect on these brands and, consequently, our business.\nWe may require additional capital to finance the acquisition of additional brands, and our inability to raise such capital on beneficial terms or at all could limit our growth.\nWe may, in the future, require additional capital to help fund all or part of potential acquisitions. If, at the time required, we do not have sufficient cash to finance those additional capital needs, we will need to raise additional funds through equity and/or debt financing. We cannot guarantee that, if and when needed, additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If additional capital is needed and is either unavailable or cost prohibitive, our growth may be limited as we may need to change our business strategy to slow the rate of, or eliminate, our expansion plans. In addition, any additional financing we undertake could impose additional covenants upon us that restrict our operating flexibility, and, if we issue equity securities to raise capital, our existing stockholders may experience dilution or the new securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock.\nWe expect to incur transaction costs in connection with our acquisitions.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs and expenses in connection with past and future acquisitions, including financial advisory, legal, accounting, consulting and other advisory fees and expenses, reorganization and restructuring costs, litigation defense costs, severance/employee benefit-related expenses, filing fees, printing expenses and other related charges. There are also a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with our acquisitions. There are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or timing of the integration and implementation expenses. These costs and expenses could reduce the benefits and income we expect to achieve from our acquisitions.", "PERMNO": 14174, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "SQBG"}
