{"cik": "1173489", "company": "CEVA INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nWe caution you that the following important factors, among others, could cause our actual future results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, communications with investors and oral statements. Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this annual report, and in any other public statements we make, may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors mentioned in the discussion below will be important in determining future results. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and as a result we could experience a loss of sales, lower prices and lower revenues.\nThe markets for the products in which our technology is incorporated are highly competitive. Aggressive competition could result in substantial declines in the prices that we are able to charge for our intellectual property. Many of our competitors are striving to increase their share of the growing DSP market and are reducing their licensing and royalty fees to attract customers. The following industry players and factors may have a significant impact on our competitiveness:\n\u2022\nwe compete directly in the DSP cores space with Verisilicon and Cadence;\n\u2022\nwe compete with CPU IP or configurable CPU IP (offering DSP configured CPU and/or DSP acceleration to their IP) providers, such as ARM Holdings, Imagination Technologies (resulting from its acquisition of MIPS Technologies), Synopsys and Cadence;\n\u2022\nwe compete with internal engineering teams at companies such as Broadcom, Mediatek, Qualcomm, Samsung, Huawei, that may design programmable DSP core products in-house and therefore not license our technologies;\n\u2022\nwe compete in the SATA and SAS IP markets with several vendors, such as Gennum\u2019s Snowbush IP group, Silicon Image and Synopsys, that offer similar products, thereby leading to pricing pressures for both licensing and royalty revenues;\n\u2022\nwe compete in the digital photography and embedded vision market with Cadence and GPU IP providers such as ARM, Imagination Technologies and Vivante;\n\u2022\nwe compete in the VoIP applications market with ARM Holdings, Imagination Technologies and Verisilicon; and\n\u2022\nwe compete in the audio applications market with ARM Holdings, Synopsys, Cadence and Verisilicon.\nIn addition, we may face increased competition from smaller, niche semiconductor design companies in the future. Some of our customers also may decide to satisfy their needs through in-house design. We compete on the basis of DSP performance, overall chip cost, power consumption, flexibility, reliability, communication and multimedia software availability, design cycle time, tool chain, customer support, name recognition, reputation and financial strength. Our inability to compete effectively on these bases could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur quarterly operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, including our lengthy sales cycle, and may not be a meaningful indicator of future performance.\nIn some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to fall. Factors that may affect our quarterly results of operations in the future include, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe gain or loss of significant licensees, partly due to our dependence on a limited number of customers generating a significant amount of quarterly revenues;\n\u2022\nany delay in execution of any anticipated licensing arrangement during a particular quarter;\n\u2022\ndelays in revenue recognition for some license agreements based on percentage of completion of customized work;\n\u2022\nthe timing and volume of orders and production by our customers, as well as fluctuations in royalty revenues resulting from fluctuations in unit shipments by our licensees;\n\u2022\nroyalty pricing pressures and reduction in royalty rates due to an increase in volume shipments by customers, end-product price erosion and competitive pressures;\n\u2022\nearnings or other financial announcements by our major customers that include shipment data or other information that implicates expectations for our future royalty revenues;\n\u2022\nthe mix of revenues among licensing and related revenues, and royalty revenues;\n\u2022\nthe timing of the introduction of new or enhanced technologies by us and our competitors, as well as the market acceptance of such technologies;\n\u2022\nour ability to integrate the RivieraWaves acquisition and the impact to operating expenses of such integration;\n\u2022\nthe discontinuation, or public announcement thereof, of product lines or market sectors that incorporate our technology by our significant customers;\n\u2022\nour lengthy sales cycle and specifically in the third quarter of any fiscal year during which summer vacations slow down decision-making processes of our customers in executing contracts;\n\u2022\ndelays in the commercialization of end products that incorporate our technology;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations, mainly of the Euro and the NIS versus the U.S. dollar;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in operating expenses and gross margins associated with the introduction of new or enhanced technologies and adjustments to operating expenses resulting from restructurings;\n\u2022\nthe timing of Israeli R&D government grants from the Office of the Chief Scientist of Israel, EU grants and French research tax credits;\n\u2022\nthe timing of our payment of royalties to the Office of the Chief Scientist, which is impacted by the timing and magnitude of license agreements and royalty revenues derived from technologies that were funded by grant programs of the Office of the Chief Scientist;\n\u2022\nstatutory changes associated with research tax benefits applicable to French technology companies as a result of our acquisition of RivieraWaves SAS;\n\u2022\nour ability to scale our operations in response to changes in demand for our technologies;\n\u2022\nentry into new markets, including China, India and Latin America;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies and those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nrestructuring, asset and goodwill impairment and related charges, as well as other accounting changes or adjustments; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions, including the current economic conditions, and its effect on the semiconductor industry and sales of consumer products into which our technologies are incorporated.\nEach of the above factors is difficult to forecast and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, we license our technology to OEMs and semiconductor companies for incorporation into their end products for consumer markets, including handsets and consumer electronics products. The royalties we generate are reported by our customers and invoiced by us one quarter in arrears. As a result, our royalty revenues are affected by seasonal buying patterns of consumer products sold by our OEM customers that\nincorporate our technology and the market acceptance of such end products supplied by our OEM customers. The second quarter in any given year is usually a sequentially down quarter for us in relation to royalty revenues as this period represents lower post-Christmas first quarter consumer product shipments and little to no new introduction of handsets during the first quarter of the year. However, the magnitude of this second quarter decrease varies annually and has been impacted by global economic conditions, market share changes, exiting or refocusing of market sectors by our customers and the timing of introduction of new and existing handset devices powered by CEVA technology sold in any given quarter compared to the prior quarter.\nMoreover, the semiconductor and consumer electronics industries remain volatile, which makes it extremely difficult for our customers and us to accurately forecast financial results and plan for future business activities. As a result, our past operating results should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\nWe rely significantly on revenues derived from a limited number of customers who contribute to our royalty and license revenues.\nWe derive a significant amount of revenues from a limited number of customers. Sales to Spreadtrum represented 25%, 28% and 24% of our total revenues for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Sales to Intel represented 11% and 13% of our total revenues for 2013 and 2012, respectively, but represented less than 10% in 2014. Sales to Broadcom represented 12% of our total revenues for only 2012. With respect to our royalty revenues, three royalty paying customers each represented 10% or more of our total royalty revenues for 2014, and collectively represented 79% of our total royalty revenues for 2014, compared to four royalty paying customers each representing 10% or more of our total royalty revenues for 2013 and 2012, and collectively representing 81% and 74% of our total royalty revenues for 2013 and 2012, respectively. We expect that a significant portion of our future revenues will continue to be generated by a limited number of customers. The loss of any significant royalty paying customer could adversely affect our near-term future operating results. For example, the shift away from feature phones by Intel and the exiting of the handset baseband market by Broadcom in 2014 negatively impacted our annual 2014 revenues. Furthermore, consolidation among our customers may negatively affect our revenue source, increase our existing customers\u2019 negotiation leverage and make us further dependent on a limited number of customers. Moreover, the discontinuation of product lines or market sectors that incorporate our technology by our significant customers or a change in direction of their business and our inability to adapt our technology to their new business needs could have material negative implications for our future royalty revenues.\nOur business is dependent on licensing revenues which may vary period to period.\nLicense agreements for our DSP cores and platforms have not historically provided for substantial ongoing license payments so past licensing revenues may not be indicative of the amount of such revenues in any future period. We believe that there is a similar risk with the newly acquired RivieraWaves operations associated with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity technologies. Significant portions of our anticipated future revenues, therefore, will likely depend upon our success in attracting new customers or expanding our relationships with existing customers. However, revenues recognized from licensing arrangements vary significantly from period to period, depending on the number and size of deals closed during a quarter, and is difficult to predict. In addition, as we expand our business into the non-baseband markets, our licensing deals may be smaller but greater in volume which may further fluctuate our licensing revenues quarter to quarter. Our ability to succeed in our licensing efforts will depend on a variety of factors, including the performance, quality, breadth and depth of our current and future products, as well as our sales and marketing skills. In addition, some of our licensees may in the future decide to satisfy their needs through in-house design and production. Our failure to obtain future licensing customers would impede our future revenue growth and could materially harm our business.\nRoyalty rates could decrease for existing and future license agreements which could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nRoyalty payments to us under existing and future license agreements could be lower than currently anticipated for a variety of reasons. Average selling prices for semiconductor products generally decrease over time during the lifespan of a product. In addition, there is increasing downward pricing pressures in the semiconductor industry on end products incorporating our technology, especially end products for the handsets and consumer electronics markets. As a result, notwithstanding the existence of a license agreement, our customers may demand that royalty rates for our products be lower than our historic royalty rates. We have in the past and may be pressured in the future to renegotiate existing license agreements with our customers. In addition, certain of our license agreements provide that royalty rates may decrease in connection with the sale of larger quantities of products incorporating our technology. Furthermore, our competitors may lower the royalty rates for their comparable products to win market share which may force us to lower our royalty rates as well. As a consequence of the above referenced factors, as well as unforeseen factors in the future, the royalty rates we receive for use of our technology could decrease, thereby decreasing future anticipated revenues and cash flow. Royalty revenues were approximately 44%, 54% and 60% of our total revenues for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Therefore, a significant decrease in our royalty revenues could materially adversely affect our operating results.\nMoreover, royalty rates may be negatively affected by macroeconomic trends or changes in products mix. For example, our royalty revenues decreased in 2013 and 2012 in connection with a significant decline in the average selling prices of low-cost feature phones. Furthermore, consolidation among our customers may increase the leverage of our existing customers to extract concessions from us in royalty rates. Moreover, changes in products mix such as an increase in lower royalty bearing products shipped in high volume like low-cost feature phones and Bluetooth-based products in lieu of higher royalty bearing products like LTE phones could lower our royalty revenues.\nWe generate a significant amount of our total revenues from the cellular baseband market and our business and operating results may be materially adversely affected if we do not continue to succeed in these highly competitive markets.\nOur total revenues derived solely from the cellular baseband market represented 49%, 60% and 62% of our total revenues for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. A significant portion of such revenues is derived from feature phones. However, the shift away from feature phones by our customer Intel and the exiting of the handset baseband market by our customer Broadcom have negatively impacted our royalty revenues. Moreover, although next generation products generally have higher average selling prices, the shift towards LTE technology has been slower than expected and we can provide no assurances that the trend towards next generation products will continue on pace. Furthermore, we can provide no assurances that we will be successful in offsetting any decline in revenues from feature phones with increased revenues from next generation products such as low-cost smartphones or LTE phones. Any adverse change in our ability to compete and maintain our competitive position in the cellular baseband market, including through the introduction by competitors of enhanced technologies that attract OEM customers that target these markets, would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the cellular baseband market is extremely competitive and are facing intense pricing pressures, and we expect that competition and pricing pressures will only increase. Furthermore, it can be very volatile with regards to volume shipments of different phones, standards and connected devices due to inventory build out or consumer demand changes or geographical macroeconomics, pricing changes and timing of introduction of new phones and products. Our existing OEM customers also may fail to introduce new handset devices that attract consumers, or encounter significant delays in developing, manufacturing or shipping new or enhanced products in these markets. The inability of our OEM customers to compete would result in lower shipments of products powered by our technologies which in turn would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Since a significant portion of our revenues are derived from the cellular baseband market, adverse conditions in this market would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause our IP solutions are components of end products, if semiconductor companies and electronic equipment manufacturers do not incorporate our solutions into their end products or if the end products of our customers do not achieve market acceptance, we may not be able to generate adequate sales of our products.\nWe do not sell our IP solutions directly to end-users; we license our technology primarily to semiconductor companies and electronic equipment manufacturers, who then incorporate our technology into the products they sell. As a result, we rely on our customers to incorporate our technology into their end products at the design stage. Once a company incorporates a competitor\u2019s technology into its end product, it becomes significantly more difficult for us to sell our technology to that company because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort and risk for the company. As a result, we may incur significant expenditures on the development of a new technology without any assurance that our existing or potential customers will select our technology for incorporation into their own product and without this \u201cdesign win,\u201d it becomes significantly difficult to sell our IP solutions. Moreover, even after a customer agrees to incorporate our technology into its end products, the design cycle is long and may be delayed due to factors beyond our control, which may result in the end product incorporating our technology not reaching the market until long after the initial \u201cdesign win\u201d with such customer. From initial product design-in to volume production, many factors could impact the timing and/or amount of sales actually realized from the design-in. These factors include, but are not limited to, changes in the competitive position of our technology, our customers\u2019 financial stability, and our customers\u2019 ability to ship products according to our customers\u2019 schedule. Moreover, current economic conditions may further prolong a customer\u2019s decision-making process and design cycle.\nFurther, because we do not control the business practices of our customers, we do not influence the degree to which they promote our technology or set the prices at which they sell products incorporating our technology. We cannot assure you that our customers will devote satisfactory efforts to promote their end products which incorporate our IP solutions.\nIn addition, our royalties from licenses and therefore the growth of our business, are dependent upon the success of our customers in introducing products incorporating our technology and the success of those products in the marketplace. The primary customers for our products are semiconductor design and manufacturing companies, system OEMs and electronic equipment manufacturers, particularly in the telecommunications field. These industries are highly competitive, cyclical and have been subject to significant economic downturns at various times. These downturns are characterized by production overcapacity and reduced revenues, which at times may encourage semiconductor companies or electronic product manufacturers to reduce their expenditure on our technology. If we do not retain our current customers and continue to attract new customers, our business may be harmed.\nWe depend on market acceptance of third-party semiconductor intellectual property.\nThe semiconductor intellectual property (SIP) industry is a relatively small and emerging industry. Our future growth will depend on the level of market acceptance of our third-party licensable intellectual property model, the variety of intellectual property offerings available on the market, and a shift in customer preference away from in-house development of proprietary DSPs and connectivity IPs towards licensing open DSP cores, platforms and connectivity IPs. Furthermore, the third-party licensable intellectual property model is highly dependent on the market adoption of new services and products, such as low cost smartphones in emerging markets, LTE smartphones, mobile broadband, small cell base stations and the increased use of advanced audio, voice, computational photography and embedded vision in mobile, automotive and consumer products, as well as in IoT and connectivity applications. Such market adoption is important because the increased cost associated with ownership and maintenance of the more complex architectures needed for the advanced services and products may motivate companies to license third-party intellectual property rather than design them in-house.\nThe trends that would enable our growth are largely beyond our control. Semiconductor customers also may choose to adopt a multi-chip, off-the-shelf chip solution versus licensing or using highly-integrated chipsets that embed our technologies. If the above referenced market shifts do not materialize or third-party SIP does not achieve market acceptance, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed.\nBecause we have significant international operations, we may be subject to political, economic and other conditions relating to our international operations that could increase our operating expenses and disrupt our revenues and business.\nApproximately 77% of our total revenues for 2014, 88% for 2013 and 79% for 2012 were derived from customers located outside of the United States. We expect that international customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, the occurrence of any negative international political, economic or geographic events could result in significant revenue shortfalls. These shortfalls could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to be harmed. Some of the risks of doing business internationally include:\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar;\n\u2022\nimposition of tariffs and other barriers and restrictions;\n\u2022\nburdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws, treaties and technical standards;\n\u2022\nuncertainty of laws and enforcement in certain countries relating to the protection of intellectual property;\n\u2022\nmultiple and possibly overlapping tax structures and potentially adverse tax consequences;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability; and\n\u2022\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships.\nWe depend on a limited number of key personnel who would be difficult to replace.\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon certain of our key employees and senior management, the loss of which could materially harm our business. Competition for skilled employees in our field is intense. We cannot assure you that in the future we will be successful in attracting and retaining the required personnel.\nThe sales cycle for our IP solutions is lengthy, which makes forecasting of our customer orders and revenues difficult.\nThe sales cycle for our IP solutions is lengthy, often lasting three to nine months. Our customers generally conduct significant technical evaluations, including customer trials, of our technology as well as competing technologies prior to making a purchasing decision. In addition, purchasing decisions also may be delayed because of a customer\u2019s internal budget approval process. Furthermore, given the current market conditions, we have less ability to predict the timing of our customers\u2019 purchasing cycle and potential unexpected delays in such a cycle. Because of the lengthy sales cycle and potential delays, our dependence on a limited number of customers to generate a significant amount of revenues for a particular period and the size of customer orders, if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular period do not occur in that period, our revenues and operating results for that particular quarter could suffer. Moreover, a portion of our expenses related to an anticipated order is fixed and difficult to reduce or change, which may further impact our operating results for a particular period.\nBecause our IP solutions are complex, the detection of errors in our products may be delayed, and if we deliver products with defects, our credibility will be harmed, the sales and market acceptance of our products may decrease and product liability claims may be made against us.\nOur IP solutions are complex and may contain errors, defects and bugs when introduced. If we deliver products with errors, defects or bugs, our credibility and the market acceptance and sales of our products could be significantly harmed. Furthermore, the nature of our products may also delay the detection of any such error or defect. If our products contain errors, defects and bugs, then we may be required to expend significant capital and resources to alleviate these problems. This could result in the diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts. Any actual or perceived problems or delays may also adversely affect our ability to attract or retain customers. Furthermore, the existence of any defects, errors or failure in our products could lead to product liability claims or lawsuits against us or against our customers. A successful product liability claim could result in substantial cost and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which would have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success will depend on our ability to successfully manage our geographically dispersed operations.\nMost of our employees are located in Israel and we added French employees after the RivieraWaves acquisition. Accordingly, our ability to compete successfully will depend in part on the ability of a limited number of key executives located in geographically dispersed offices to integrate management, address the needs of our customers and respond to changes in our markets. If we are unable to effectively manage and integrate our remote operations, our business may be materially harmed.\nOur operations in Israel may be adversely affected by instability in the Middle East region.\nOne of our principal research and development facilities is located in Israel, and our executive officers and some of our directors are residents of Israel. Although substantially all of our sales currently are being made to customers outside Israel, we are nonetheless directly influenced by the political, economic and military conditions affecting Israel. Any major hostilities involving Israel could significantly harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, certain of our employees are currently obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces and are subject to being called to active military duty at any time. Although we have operated effectively under these requirements since our inception, we cannot predict the effect of these obligations on the company in the future. Our operations could be disrupted by the absence, for a significant period, of one or more of our key employees due to military service.\nOur research and development expenses may increase if the grants we currently receive from the Israeli government and European Union are reduced or withheld.\nWe currently receive research grants from programs of the Office of the Chief Scientist of Israel of the Israeli Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Seventh Framework Program of the European Union. We recorded an aggregate of $4,586,000, $3,304,000 and $2,849,000 in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. To be eligible for these grants, we must meet certain development conditions and comply with periodic reporting obligations. Although we have met such conditions in the past, should we fail to meet such conditions in the future our research grants may be repayable, reduced or withheld. The repayment or reduction of such research grants may increase our research and development expenses which in turn may reduce our operating income. Also, the timing of such payments from the Office of the Chief Scientist and European Union may vary from year to year and quarter to quarter, and we have no control on the timing of such payment.\nThe Israeli tax benefits that we currently receive and the government programs in which we participate require us to meet certain conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future, which could increase our tax expenses.\nWe enjoy certain tax benefits in Israel, particularly as a result of the \u201cApproved Enterprise\u201d and the \u201cBenefited Enterprise\u201d status of our facilities and programs. To maintain our eligibility for these tax benefits, we must continue to meet certain conditions, relating principally to adherence to the investment program filed with the Investment Center of the Israeli Ministry of Industry and Trade and to periodic reporting obligations. Should we fail to meet such conditions in the future, these benefits would be cancelled and we would be subject to corporate tax in Israel at the standard corporate rate (26.5% in 2014) and could be required to refund tax benefits already received. In addition, we cannot assure you that these tax benefits will be continued in the future at their current levels or otherwise. The tax benefits under our active investment programs are scheduled to gradually expire starting in 2017. The termination or reduction of certain programs and tax benefits (particularly benefits available to us as a result of the \u201cApproved Enterprise\u201d and the \u201cBenefited Enterprise\u201d status of our facilities and programs) or a requirement to refund tax benefits already received may seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur failure to maintain certain research tax benefits applicable to French technology companies may adversely affect the results of operations of our RivieraWaves operations.\nPursuant to our acquisition of the RivieraWaves operations, we will benefit from certain research tax credits applicable to French technology companies, including, for example, the CIR. The CIR is a French tax credit aimed at stimulating research activities. The CIR can be offset against French corporate income tax due and the portion in excess (if any) may be refunded annually. The French Parliament can decide to eliminate, or reduce the scope or the rate of, the CIR benefit, at any time or challenge our eligibility or calculations for such tax credits, all of which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and future cash flows.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nA significant portion of our business is conducted outside the United States. Although most of our revenues are transacted in U.S. dollars, we may be exposed to currency exchange fluctuations in the future as business practices evolve and we are forced to transact business in local currencies. Moreover, the majority of our expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, mainly New Israeli Shekel (NIS) and Euro, which subjects us to the risks of foreign currency fluctuations. Our primary expenses paid in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are employee salaries. Increases in the volatility of the exchange rates of currencies other than the U.S. dollar versus the U.S. dollar could have an adverse effect on the expenses and liabilities that we incur in currencies other than the U.S. dollar when remeasured into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. We have instituted a foreign cash flow hedging program to minimize the effects of currency fluctuations. However, hedging transactions may not successfully mitigate losses caused by currency fluctuations, and our hedging positions may be partial or may not exist at all in the future. We also review our monthly expected non-U.S. dollar denominated expenditure and look to hold equivalent non-U.S. dollar cash balances to mitigate currency fluctuations. We expect to continue to experience the effect of exchange rate currency fluctuations on an annual and quarterly basis.\nOur product development efforts are time-consuming and expensive and may not generate an acceptable return, if any.\nOur product development efforts require us to incur substantial research and development expense. Our research and development expenses were approximately $25.8 million, $21.2 million and $20.2 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We may not be able to achieve an acceptable return, if any, on our research and development efforts.\nThe development of our products is highly complex. We occasionally have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products and product enhancements, and we could experience delays in the future. Unanticipated problems in developing products could also divert substantial engineering resources, which may impair our ability to develop new products and enhancements and could substantially increase our costs. Furthermore, we may expend significant amounts on research and development programs that may not ultimately result in commercially successful products. Our research and expense levels have increased from the third quarter of 2014 after the acquisition of RivieraWaves. As a result of these and other factors, we may be unable to develop and introduce new products successfully and in a cost-effective and timely manner, and any new products we develop and offer may never achieve market acceptance. Any failure to successfully develop future products would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to meet the changing needs of our end-users or address evolving market demands, our business may be harmed.\nThe markets for programmable DSP cores, application IPs and connectivity IPs are characterized by rapidly changing technology, emerging markets and new and developing end-user needs, and requiring significant expenditure for research and development. We cannot assure you that we will be able to introduce systems and solutions that reflect prevailing industry standards, on a timely basis, meet the specific technical requirements of our end-users or avoid significant losses due to rapid decreases in market prices of our products, and our failure to do so may seriously harm our business.\nIf we are unable to integrate the RivieraWaves acquisition successfully, our business may be harmed.\nThe acquisition of RivieraWaves consummated in July 2014. The integration of RivieraWaves involves a number of risks, including assimilation of new operations and personnel into CEVA, the management of additional operating expenses, the diversion of resources, including our management\u2019s time and resources, from our existing business to facilitate the integration, coordination of the respective research and development, and sales and marketing personnel, and the maintenance of standards, controls, procedures and policies. In connection with the acquisition, we incurred additional operating expenses starting from the third quarter of 2014, including: (1) RivieraWaves expenses in the amount of approximately $1.7 million on a quarterly basis for 2015, which includes the RivieraWaves employee retention scheme expenses, and (2) quarterly amortization of intangible assets and equity-based compensation expenses of approximately $0.4 million. We cannot provide any assurances that such projected operating expenses will not increase or that we will not incur additional expenses to reflect costs associated with the acquisition or the integration of the RivieraWaves operations. Costs associated with the acquisition, or liabilities and expenses associated with the RivieraWaves operations, that exceed our expectations could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we cannot provide any assurances that we will realize the synergistic, strategic and financial benefits sought through the acquisition. We currently anticipate that as a result of the acquisition, our initial goal is to reach shipments of 400 million units of royalty-bearing connected devices (exclusive of handsets) by 2018 and a 25% increase in our annual 2015 licensing revenues as compared to our historical revenue figures in the range of $22 million to $24 million. Although we view the acquisition as a significant opportunity, we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in combining our DSP technology with RivieraWaves\u2019 Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity technologies to expand the addressable market, or that the combination would significantly increase our revenues.\nWe may seek to expand our business in ways that could result in diversion of resources and extra expenses.\nWe may in the future pursue acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies, establish joint venture arrangements, make minority equity investments or enhance our existing CEVAnet partner eco-system to expand our business. We are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition, equity investment or joint venture will be completed. The process of negotiating potential acquisitions, joint ventures or equity investments, as well as the integration of acquired or jointly developed businesses, technologies or products may be prolonged\ndue to unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our resources and management\u2019s attention. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates, complete acquisitions or investments, or integrate acquired businesses or joint ventures with our operations. If we were to make any acquisition or investment or enter into a joint venture, we may not receive the intended benefits of the acquisition, investment or joint venture or such an acquisition, investment or joint venture may not achieve comparable levels of revenues, profitability or productivity as our existing business or otherwise perform as expected. The expansion of our CEVAnet partner eco-system also may not achieve the anticipated benefits. The occurrence of any of these events could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. Future acquisitions, investments or joint ventures may require substantial capital resources, which may require us to seek additional debt or equity financing.\nFuture acquisitions, joint ventures or minority equity investments by us could result in the following, any of which could seriously harm our results of operations or the price of our stock:\n\u2022\nissuance of equity securities that would dilute our current stockholders\u2019 percentages of ownership;\n\u2022\nlarge one-time write-offs or equity investment impairment write-offs;\n\u2022\nincurrence of debt and contingent liabilities;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation and integration of operations, personnel, technologies, products and information systems of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\ninability to realize cost efficiencies or synergies, thereby incurring higher operating expenditures as a result of the acquisition;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\ncontractual disputes;\n\u2022\nrisks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or only limited prior experience; and\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees of acquired organizations.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in large part upon the protection of our proprietary technologies. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, mask work and other intellectual property rights, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. These agreements and measures may not be sufficient to protect our technology from third-party infringement or protect us from the claims of others. As a result, we face risks associated with our patent position, including the potential need to engage in significant legal proceedings to enforce our patents, the possibility that the validity or enforceability of our patents may be denied, the possibility that third parties will be able to compete against us without infringing our patents and the possibility that our products may infringe patent rights of third parties.\nOur trade names or trademarks may be registered or utilized by third parties in countries other than those in which we have registered them, impairing our ability to enter and compete in these markets. If we were forced to change any of our brand names, we could lose a significant amount of our brand identity.\nOur business will suffer if we are sued for infringement of the intellectual property rights of third parties or if we cannot obtain licenses to these rights on commercially acceptable terms.\nWe are subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. There are a large number of patents held by others, including our competitors, pertaining to the broad areas in which we are active. We have not, and cannot reasonably, investigate all such patents. From time\nto time, we have become aware of patents in our technology areas and have sought legal counsel regarding the validity of such patents and their impact on how we operate our business, and we will continue to seek such counsel when appropriate in the future. In addition, patent infringement claims are increasingly being asserted by patent holding companies (so-called patent \u201ctrolls\u201d), which do not use technology and whose sole business is to enforce patents against companies, such as us, for monetary gain. Because such patent holding companies do not provide services or use technology, the assertion of our own patents by way of counter-claim may be ineffective. Infringement claims may require us to enter into license arrangements or result in protracted and costly litigation, regardless of the merits of these claims. Any necessary licenses may not be available or, if available, may not be obtainable on commercially reasonable terms. If we cannot obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, we may be forced to stop licensing our technology, and our business would be seriously harmed.\nThe future growth of our business depends in part on our ability to license to system OEMs and small-to-medium-sized semiconductor companies directly and to expand our sales geographically.\nHistorically, a substantial portion of our licensing revenues has been derived in any given period from a relatively small number of licensees. Because of the substantial license fees we charge, our customers tend to be large semiconductor companies or vertically integrated system OEMs. Part of our current growth strategy is to broaden the adoption of our products by small and mid-size companies by offering different versions of our products targeted at these companies. If we are unable to develop and market effectively our intellectual property through these models, our revenues will continue to be dependent on a smaller number of licensees and a less geographically dispersed pattern of licensees, which could materially harm our business and results of operations.\nOur operating results are affected by the highly cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry.\nWe operate within the semiconductor industry which experiences significant fluctuations in sales and profitability. Downturns in the semiconductor industry are characterized by diminished product demand, excess customer inventories, accelerated erosion of prices and excess production capacity. These factors could cause substantial fluctuations in our revenues and in our results of operations.\nWe may dispose of or discontinue existing product lines and technology developments, which may adversely impact our future results.\nOn an ongoing basis, we evaluate our various product offerings and technology developments in order to determine whether any should be discontinued or, to the extent possible, divested. We cannot guarantee that we have correctly forecasted, or will correctly forecast in the future, the right product lines and technology developments to dispose or discontinue or that our decision to dispose of or discontinue various investments, products lines and technology developments is prudent if market conditions change. In addition, there are no assurances that the discontinuance of various product lines will reduce our operating expenses or will not cause us to incur material charges associated with such decision. Furthermore, the discontinuance of existing product lines entails various risks, including the risk that we will not be able to find a purchaser for a product line or the purchase price obtained will not be equal to at least the book value of the net assets for the product line. Other risks include managing the expectations of, and maintaining good relations with, our customers who previously purchased products from our disposed or discontinued product lines, which could prevent us from selling other products to them in the future. We may also incur other significant liabilities and costs associated with our disposal or discontinuance of product lines, including employee severance costs and excess facilities costs.\nOur corporate tax rate may increase, which could adversely impact our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have significant operations in Israel, as well operations in the Republic of Ireland and in France, and a substantial portion of our taxable income historically has been generated in Israel. Currently, some of our Israeli and Irish subsidiaries are taxed at rates substantially lower than the U.S. tax rates. If our Israeli and Irish\nsubsidiaries were no longer to qualify for these lower tax rates or if the applicable tax laws were rescinded or changed, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. In addition, because our Israeli, Irish and French operations are owned by subsidiaries of our U.S. parent corporation, distributions to the U.S. parent corporation, and in certain circumstances undistributed income of the subsidiaries, may be subject to U.S. taxes. Moreover, if U.S. or other authorities were to change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge the manner in which our subsidiaries\u2019 profits are currently recognized, our overall tax expenses could increase, and our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Also our taxes on the Irish interest income may be double taxed both in Ireland and in the U.S. due to U.S. tax regulations and Irish tax restrictions on NOLs to off-set interest income. In addition, starting in 2012, our Israeli interest income also may be taxed both in Israel and the U.S due to different Controlled Foreigner Corporation rules.\nOur stock price may be volatile so you may not be able to resell your shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid for them.\nAnnouncements of developments related to our business, announcements by competitors, quarterly fluctuations in our financial results, changes in the general conditions of the highly dynamic industry in which we compete or the national economies in which we do business, and other factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially. In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. These factors and fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 89572, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "CEVA"}
