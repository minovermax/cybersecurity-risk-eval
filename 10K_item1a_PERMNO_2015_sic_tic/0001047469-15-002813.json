{"cik": "1360683", "company": "TALMER BANCORP, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to certain risks, including those described below. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occurs, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. More detailed information concerning these risks is contained in other sections of this report, including \"Business\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nRisks Related to Our Business\nA return of recessionary conditions could result in increases in our level of nonperforming loans and/or reduced demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nEconomic recession or other economic problems, including those affecting our primary markets in Michigan and Ohio, and our other markets in Indiana, Illinois and Nevada, but also those affecting the U.S. or world economies, could have a material adverse impact on the demand for our products and services. Since the conclusion of the last recession, economic growth has been slow and uneven, and unemployment levels remain high. In addition, the values of real estate collateral supporting many commercial loans and home mortgages have declined and may continue to decline. If economic conditions deteriorate, or if there are negative developments affecting the domestic and international credit markets, the value of our loans and investments may be harmed, which in turn would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the price of our common stock.\nOur strategic growth plan contemplates additional acquisitions, which could expose us to additional risks.\nSince April 2010, we have completed seven acquisitions and continue to periodically evaluate opportunities to acquire additional financial institutions, including purchases of failed banks from the FDIC. As a result, we may engage in acquisitions and other transactions that could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition, including short and long-term liquidity.\nOur acquisition activities could require us to use a substantial amount of cash, other liquid assets, and/or incur debt. In addition, if goodwill recorded in connection with our potential future acquisitions were determined to be impaired, then we would be required to recognize a charge against our earnings, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations during the period in which the impairment was recognized.\nOur acquisition activities could involve a number of additional risks, including the risks of:\n\u2022 incurring time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions, resulting in management's attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business;\n\u2022 using inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets;\n\u2022 incurring time and expense required to integrate the operations and personnel of the combined businesses, creating an adverse short-term effect on results of operations; and\n\u2022 losing key employees and customers as a result of an acquisition that is poorly received.\nWe may be exposed to difficulties in combining the operations of acquired institutions into our own operations, which may prevent us from achieving the expected benefits from our acquisition activities.\nWe may not be able to fully achieve the strategic objectives and operating efficiencies that we anticipate in our acquisition activities. Inherent uncertainties exist in integrating the operations of an acquired institution. In addition, the markets in which we and our potential acquisition targets operate are highly competitive. We may lose customers or the customers of an acquired institution as a result of an acquisition. We also may lose key personnel from the acquired institution as a result of an acquisition. We may not discover all known and unknown factors when examining an institution for acquisition during the due diligence period. These factors could produce unintended and unexpected consequences. Undiscovered factors as a result of an acquisition could bring civil, criminal and financial liabilities against us, our management and the management of the institutions we acquire. These factors could contribute to our not achieving the expected benefits from our acquisitions within desired time frames, if at all.\nMichigan Commerce Bank was subject to a Consent Order issued by its regulators on April 5, 2010 that requires it to take specified actions, and the Consent Order remains in effect following the consummation of our acquisition of Michigan Commerce Bank, now Talmer West Bank, on January 1, 2014.\nOn April 5, 2010, Michigan Commerce Bank consented to the issuance of a Consent Order by the FDIC and the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services, which remains in effect following our acquisition of Michigan Commerce Bank, now Talmer West Bank, on January 1, 2014. Our failure to comply with the terms of the Consent Order could result in significant enforcement actions against us, up to and including a regulatory takeover of Talmer West Bank, which comprises a significant portion of our business. Under the terms of the Consent Order, Talmer West Bank is required to take certain actions, including, among other things: assessing and retaining qualified management; achieving and maintaining specified capital ratios; reducing certain classified assets, including the charge-off of loans classified \"loss;\" reviewing the allowance for loan and lease losses\npolicy; implementing a comprehensive profit plan and budget; implementing a plan to manage concentrations of credit; and revising the bank's policies governing interest rate risk.\nThe Consent Order also prohibits Talmer West Bank, without prior regulatory approval, from:\n\u2022 paying dividends;\n\u2022 retaining new directors or senior executive officers; and\n\u2022 entering into any material transaction, including, but not limited to, any investment, expansion, sale of assets or acquisition.\nTalmer West Bank's regulators have considerable discretion in whether to grant required approvals, and we may not be able to obtain those approvals if requested. Until we achieve compliance with the Consent Order and the Consent Order is lifted, we will have higher operating expenses and we will not fully recognize anticipated cost savings and synergies related to our acquisition of Talmer West Bank, all of which will adversely affect our financial performance.\nDecreased residential mortgage origination, volume and pricing decisions of competitors may adversely affect our profitability.\nWe currently operate a residential mortgage business. Changes in interest rates and pricing decisions by our loan competitors may adversely affect demand for our residential mortgage loan products, the revenue realized on the sale of loans and revenues received from servicing such loans for others, and ultimately reduce our net income. New regulations, increased regulatory reviews, and/or changes in the structure of the secondary mortgage markets which we would utilize to sell mortgage loans may be introduced and may increase costs and make it more difficult to operate a residential mortgage origination business.\nWe have recognized significant income from bargain purchase gains in connection with our acquisitions that may be non-recurring in future periods.\nIn connection with our four FDIC-assisted acquisitions and our acquisitions of First Place Bank and Talmer West Bank, we recorded pre-tax bargain purchase gains totaling an aggregate of $206.9 million. These gains were included as a component of noninterest income in our statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014. The amount of each bargain purchase gain recorded for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014 was equal to the amount by which the fair value of the assets purchased in the applicable acquisition exceeded the fair value of the liabilities assumed and any consideration paid. The bargain purchase gain recorded in connection with each acquisition is a one-time extraordinary gain and would only be repeated in the event that we consummated future acquisitions where the fair value of the assets purchased exceeded the fair value of the liabilities assumed and any consideration paid. If market conditions improve, the bidding process for banks could become more competitive, and the increased competition may make it more difficult for us to acquire banks in transactions that generate bargain purchase gains, or at all. If we are unable to generate bargain purchase gains in future acquisitions or if we are unable to offset such income with other sources of income, our financial condition and earnings may be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to interest rate risk, and fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings and capital levels and overall results.\nThe majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature and, as a result, we are subject to significant risk from changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates may affect our net interest income as well as the valuation of our assets and liabilities. Our earnings depend significantly on our net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, such as\nloans and securities, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. We expect to periodically experience \"gaps\" in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities, meaning that either our interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets, or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates move contrary to our position, this \"gap\" may work against us, and our earnings may be adversely affected.\nAn increase in the general level of interest rates may also, among other things, adversely affect the demand for loans and our ability to originate loans. Conversely, a decrease in the general level of interest rates, among other things, may lead to prepayments on our loan and mortgage-backed securities portfolios and increased competition for deposits. Accordingly, changes in the general level of market interest rates may adversely affect our net yield on interest-earning assets, loan origination volume and our overall results.\nAlthough our asset-liability management strategy is designed to control and mitigate exposure to the risks related to changes in the general level of market interest rates, those rates are affected by many factors outside of our control, including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, international disorder, instability in domestic and foreign financial markets and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, particularly the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the \"Federal Reserve\"). Adverse changes in the U.S. monetary policy or in economic conditions could materially and adversely affect us. We may not be able to accurately predict the likelihood, nature and magnitude of those changes or how and to what extent they may affect our business. We also may not be able to adequately prepare for or compensate for the consequences of such changes. Any failure to predict and prepare for changes in interest rates or adjust for the consequences of these changes may adversely affect our earnings and capital levels and overall results.\nOur mortgage banking profitability could significantly decline if we are not able to originate and resell a high volume of mortgage loans.\nMortgage production, especially refinancing activity, declines in rising interest rate environments. While we have been experiencing historically low and further declining interest rates throughout 2014 and into early 2015, this low interest rate environment likely will not continue indefinitely. Further, despite the favorable interest rate environment that we have operated under throughout 2014, our mortgage origination volume has dropped by approximately 50% during 2014 compared to the prior year, and we expect these comparatively lower, yet stabilized, volume levels to continue for the immediate future, particularly since we exited the wholesale lending market during the fourth quarter of 2013. Moreover, when interest rates increase further, there can be no assurance that our mortgage production will continue at current levels. Because we sell a substantial portion of the mortgage loans we originate, the profitability of our mortgage banking business also depends in large part on our ability to aggregate a high volume of loans and sell them in the secondary market at a gain. In the face of a favorable interest rate environment in 2014, our marketing gain percentage for mortgage loans sold increased marginally throughout 2014 compared to the prior year, a trend which we expect to continue in 2015, provided the continuation of a lower interest rate market. Thus, in addition to our dependence on the interest rate environment, we are dependent upon (i) the existence of an active secondary market and (ii) our ability to profitably sell loans or securities into that market. If our level of mortgage production declines, the profitability will depend upon our ability to reduce our costs commensurate with the reduction of revenue from our mortgage operations.\nOur ability to originate and sell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon the availability of an active secondary market for single-family mortgage loans, which in turn depends in part upon the continuation of programs currently offered by government-sponsored entities (\"GSEs\") and other institutional and non-institutional investors. These entities account for a substantial portion of the secondary market in residential mortgage loans. Because the largest participants in the secondary\nmarket are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, GSEs whose activities are governed by federal law, any future changes in laws that significantly affect the activity of these GSEs could, in turn, adversely affect our operations. In September 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed into conservatorship by the U.S. government. The federal government has for many years considered proposals to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, but the results of any such reform, and their impact on us, are difficult to predict. To date, no reform proposal has been enacted.\nIn addition, our ability to sell mortgage loans readily is dependent upon our ability to remain eligible for the programs offered by the GSEs and other institutional and non-institutional investors. Any significant impairment of our eligibility with any of the GSEs could materially and adversely affect our operations. Further, the criteria for loans to be accepted under such programs may be changed from time to time by the sponsoring entity, which could result in a lower volume of corresponding loan originations. The profitability of participating in specific programs may vary depending on a number of factors, including our administrative costs of originating and purchasing qualifying loans and our costs of meeting such criteria.\nThe geographic concentration of our core markets in Michigan and Ohio makes our business highly susceptible to downturns in these local economies and depressed banking markets, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nUnlike larger financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, we are a regional banking franchise concentrated in Michigan and Ohio. We operate banking centers located in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and Nevada. At December 31, 2014, prior to our acquisition of Signature Bank, approximately 50.0% of our loans were to borrowers located in Michigan, 22.0% were to borrowers located in Ohio, 7.0% were to borrowers located in Illinois and 4.0% were to borrowers located in Indiana, 4.0% were to borrowers located in Wisconsin and 3.0% were to borrowers located in Nevada. A deterioration in economic conditions in the loan or residential or commercial real estate markets in these areas could have a material adverse effect on the quality of our portfolio, the demand for our products and services, the ability of borrowers to timely repay loans and the value of the collateral securing loans. In addition, if the population, employment or income growth in one of our core markets is negative or slower than projected, income levels, deposits and real estate development could be adversely impacted and we could be materially and adversely affected.\nTo the extent that we are unable to identify and consummate attractive acquisitions, or increase loans through organic loan growth, we may be unable to successfully implement our growth strategy, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nWe intend to continue to grow our business through strategic acquisitions of banking franchises coupled with organic loan growth. Previous availability of attractive acquisition targets may not be indicative of future acquisition opportunities, and we may be unable to identify any acquisition targets that meet our investment objectives. As our acquired loan portfolio, which produces higher yields than our originated loans due to loan discount accretion on our purchased credit impaired loan portfolio (a component of the accretable yield), is paid down, we expect downward pressure on our income to the extent that the run-off is not replaced with other high-yielding loans. The accretable yield represents the excess of the net present value of expected future cash flows over the acquisition date fair value and includes both the expected coupon of the loan and the discount accretion. For example, the total loan yield for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 5.77%, while the yield generated using only the expected coupon would have been 4.69% during the same period. As a result of the foregoing, if we are unable to replace loans in our existing portfolio with comparable high-yielding loans or a larger volume of loans, we could be adversely affected. We could also be materially and adversely affected if we choose to pursue riskier higher-yielding loans that fail to perform.\nBecause we intend to make acquisitions that involve distressed assets, we may not be able to realize the value we predict from these assets or make sufficient provision for future losses in the value of, or accurately estimate the future writedowns to be taken in respect of, these assets.\nDelinquencies and losses in the loan portfolios and other assets we acquire may exceed our initial forecasts developed during our due diligence investigation prior to their acquisition and, thus, produce lower risk-adjusted returns than we believed our purchase price supported. Furthermore, our due diligence investigation may not reveal all material issues. The diligence process in FDIC-assisted transactions is also expedited due to the short acquisition timeline that is typical for these transactions. If, during the diligence process, we fail to identify all relevant issues related to an acquisition, we may be forced to later write down or write off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in significant losses. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect us. Current economic conditions have created an uncertain environment with respect to asset valuations and there is no certainty that we will be able to sell assets or institutions after we acquire them if we determine it would be in our best interests to do so. In addition, currently there is limited or no liquidity for certain asset classes we hold, including commercial real estate and construction and development loans.\nWe depend on our executive officers and other key individuals to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nWe believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our management team and our ability to motivate and retain these individuals and other key individuals. In particular, we rely on the leadership and experience in the banking industry of our Chief Executive Officer, David Provost. The loss of service of Mr. Provost or one or more of our other executive officers or key personnel could reduce our ability to successfully implement our long-term business strategy, our business could suffer and the value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected. Leadership changes will occur from time to time and we cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. We believe our management team possesses valuable knowledge about the banking industry and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replicate. Although Mr. Provost has entered into an employment agreement with us, it is possible that we or Mr. Provost may not renew the agreement, which automatically renews for successive one-year terms unless notice of termination is given by either party. Our success also depends on the experience of our branch managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nOur success is dependent upon our management team, which may be unable to successfully implement their proposed business strategy.\nOur success is largely dependent upon the ability of our management team to execute our business strategy. Our management team will need to, among other things:\n\u2022 attract sufficient retail and commercial deposits;\n\u2022 attract and maintain business banking relationships with businesses in our market areas;\n\u2022 attract and retain experienced commercial and community bankers;\n\u2022 maintain adequate regulatory capital and comply with applicable federal and state regulations;\n\u2022 attract sufficient loans, including correspondent and purchased loans that meet prudent credit standards; and\n\u2022 maintain expenses in line with their current projections.\nFailure to achieve these strategic goals could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategies and could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompetitive and regulatory dynamics may make FDIC-assisted acquisition opportunities unacceptable to us.\nOur business strategy includes the consideration of potential acquisitions of failing banks that the FDIC plans to place in receivership. The FDIC may not place banks that meet our strategic objectives into receivership. Failed bank transactions are attractive opportunities in part because of loss-sharing arrangements with the FDIC that limit the acquirer's downside risk on the purchased loan portfolio and, apart from our assumption of deposit liabilities, we have significant discretion as to the non-deposit liabilities that we assume. In addition, assets purchased from the FDIC are marked to their fair value and in many cases there is little or no addition to goodwill arising from an FDIC-assisted transaction.\nThe bidding process for failing banks in our desired markets has become very competitive, and the increased competition may make it more difficult for us to bid on terms we consider to be acceptable. Our prior acquisitions should be viewed in the context of the recent opportunities available to us as a result of the confluence of our access to capital at a time when market dislocations of historical proportions resulted in attractive asset acquisition opportunities.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the FDIC Policy Statement on Qualifications for Failed Bank Acquisitions, we are subject to significant regulatory burdens as a result of having previously acquired failed banks. For specific details of these requirements and restrictions see \"Supervision and Regulation-Bank Regulation-FDIC Statement of Policy on Qualifications for Failed Bank Acquisitions.\" The FDIC has informed us that these requirements and restrictions of the FDIC Policy Statement could be extended or reinstated if we complete additional failed bank acquisitions. As a result, prior to pursing any failed bank acquisition, we would consult closely with the FDIC prior to making a bid for a failed bank. It is possible that these regulatory burdens would make the failed bank acquisition undesirable and we would not place a bid. As economic and regulatory conditions change, we may be unable to execute this aspect of our growth strategy, which could impact our future earnings, reputation and results of operations.\nIf Talmer Bank, the Company and certain of our shareholders are not in compliance with the applicable provisions of the FDIC Policy Statement on Qualifications for Failed Bank Acquisitions, we may be unable to bid on failed institutions in the future.\nAs the agency responsible for resolving the failure of banks, the FDIC has discretion to determine whether a party is qualified to bid on a failed institution. The FDIC's Policy Statement on Qualifications for Failed Bank Acquisitions imposes restrictions and requirements on certain institutions-including us and our bank subsidiary-and their investors. Unless we, together with all of our investors who have agreed to become subject to the FDIC Policy Statement are then in compliance with the FDIC Policy Statement, the FDIC may not permit us to bid on failed institutions.\nThe FDIC Policy Statement imposes the following restrictions and requirements, among others. First, Talmer Bank was required to maintain a ratio of Tier 1 common equity to total assets of at least 10% for a period of three years, and thereafter must maintain a capital level sufficient to be well capitalized under regulatory standards during the remaining period of ownership of the investors covered by the FDIC Policy Statement (\"covered investors\"). Our most recent failed bank acquisition closed on April 29, 2011 and, therefore, our heightened capital requirement expired on April 29, 2014. Second, covered investors that collectively own 80% or more of two or more depository institutions are required to pledge to the FDIC their proportionate interests in each institution to indemnify the FDIC\nagainst any losses it incurs in connection with the failure of one of the institutions. Third, Talmer Bank is prohibited from extending credit to our covered investors and to affiliates of our covered investors. Fourth, covered investors may not employ ownership structures that use entities domiciled in bank secrecy jurisdictions (which the FDIC has interpreted to apply to a wide range of non-U.S. jurisdictions). Fifth, covered investors generally were prohibited from selling or otherwise transferring shares of our common stock that they own for a three-year period, which expired on April 30, 2013. Sixth, covered investors may not employ complex and functionally opaque ownership structures to own a beneficial interest in our bank subsidiary. Seventh, covered investors may be required to provide information to the FDIC, such as with respect to the size of the capital fund or funds, their diversification, their return profiles, their marketing documents, their management teams, and their business models. We believe that we are in compliance with each of the requirements of the FDIC Policy Statement applicable to us. The FDIC has informed us that if we acquire additional failed banks, it would review the matter closely to determine whether certain of the restrictions and requirements of the FDIC Policy Statement would be extended or reinstated. Given the capital and shareholder burdens associated with such restrictions and requirements, it is possible that we would choose not to bid on the failed bank.\nWe may be terminated as a servicer of mortgage loans, be required to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit losses on a mortgage loan, or incur costs, liabilities, fines and other sanctions if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations, including our obligations with respect to mortgage loan foreclosure actions.\nWe act as servicer for approximately $7.3 billion of residential and commercial loans owned by third parties as of December 31, 2014. As a servicer for those loans we have certain contractual obligations, including foreclosing on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent applicable, considering alternatives to foreclosure such as loan modifications or short sales. If we commit a material breach of our obligations as servicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice, causing us to lose servicing income.\nFor certain investors and/or certain transactions, we may be contractually obligated to repurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse the investor for credit losses incurred on the loan as a remedy for servicing errors with respect to the loan. If we have increased repurchase obligations because of claims that we did not satisfy our obligations as a servicer, or increased loss severity on such repurchases, we may have a significant reduction to net servicing income within our mortgage banking noninterest income. We may incur costs if we are required to, or if we elect to, re-execute or re-file documents or take other action in our capacity as a servicer in connection with pending or completed foreclosures. We may incur litigation costs if the validity of a foreclosure action is challenged by a borrower. If a court were to overturn a foreclosure because of errors or deficiencies in the foreclosure process, we may have liability to the borrower and/or to any title insurer of the property sold in foreclosure if the required process was not followed. These costs and liabilities may not be legally or otherwise reimbursable to us. In addition, if certain documents required for a foreclosure action are missing or defective, we could be obligated to cure the defect or repurchase the loan. We may incur liability to securitization investors relating to delays or deficiencies in our processing of mortgage assignments or other documents necessary to comply with state law governing foreclosures. The fair value of our mortgage servicing rights may be negatively affected to the extent our servicing costs increase because of higher foreclosure costs. We may be subject to fines and other sanctions imposed by federal or state regulators as a result of actual or perceived deficiencies in our foreclosure practices or in the foreclosure practices of other mortgage loan servicers. Any of these actions may harm our reputation or negatively affect our home lending or servicing business.\nWe may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify buyers against losses in some circumstances, which could harm our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhen mortgage loans are sold, whether as whole loans or pursuant to a securitization, we are required to make customary representations and warranties to purchasers, guarantors and insurers, including the GSEs, about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. Whole loan sale agreements require repurchase or substitute mortgage loans, or indemnify buyers against losses, in the event we breach these representations or warranties. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of early payment default of the borrower on a mortgage loan. With respect to loans that are originated through our broker or correspondent channels, the remedies available against the originating broker or correspondent, if any, may not be as broad as the remedies available to purchasers, guarantors and insurers of mortgage loans against us. We face further risk that the originating broker or correspondent, if any, may not have financial capacity to perform remedies that otherwise may be available. Therefore, if a purchaser, guarantor or insurer enforces its remedies against us, we may not be able to recover losses from the originating broker or correspondent. If repurchase and indemnity demands increase and such demands are valid claims and are in excess of our provision for potential losses, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to effectively manage credit risk and interest rate risk, our business and financial condition will suffer.\nWe must effectively manage credit risk. There are risks inherent in making any loan, including risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid, risks relating to proper loan underwriting and guidelines, risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions, risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers and risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral. In addition, a primary component of our strategy is to grow our middle market and small business lending activity and to increase retail lending activity. There is no assurance that our credit risk monitoring and loan approval procedures are or will be adequate or will reduce the inherent risks associated with lending. Our credit administration personnel, policies and procedures may not adequately adapt to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting customers and the quality of our loan portfolio. Any failure to manage such credit risks may materially adversely affect our business and our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nWe must also effectively manage interest rate risk. Because mortgage loans typically have much longer maturities than deposits or other types of funding, rising interest rates can raise the cost of funding relative to the value of the mortgage. We manage this risk in part by holding adjustable rate mortgages in portfolios and through other means. Conversely, the value of our mortgage servicing assets may fall when interest rates fall, as borrowers refinance into lower-yield loans. Given current rates, material reductions in rates may not be probable, but as rates rise, then the risk increases. There can be no assurance that we will successfully manage the lending and servicing businesses through all future interest-rate environments.\nIf our allowance for loan losses and fair value adjustments with respect to acquired loans is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will be adversely affected.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our customers may not repay their loans according to their terms, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to fully compensate us for the outstanding balance of the loan plus the costs to dispose of the collateral. As a result, we may experience significant loan losses that may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses in an attempt to cover loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio. In addition, as we increase our loan origination, the percentage of our loan portfolio not covered by FDIC loss share agreements will increase. As such, the long-term success of our business will be largely attributable to the quality of our assets, particularly newly-originated loans. In determining the size of the allowance, we rely on an analysis of our loan portfolio, our experience and our evaluation of general economic conditions. We also make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the diversification in our loan portfolio, the effect of changes in the economy on real estate and other collateral values, the results of recent regulatory examinations, the effects on the loan portfolio of current economic indicators and their probable impact on borrowers, the amount of charge-offs for the period and the amount of non-performing loans and related collateral security.\nThe application of the acquisition method of accounting in our acquisitions has impacted our allowance for loan losses. Under the acquisition method of accounting, all acquired loans were recorded in our consolidated financial statements at their fair value at the time of acquisition and the related allowance for loan loss was eliminated because credit quality, among other factors, was considered in the determination of fair value. To the extent that our estimates of fair value are too high, we will incur losses (some of which may be covered by our loss sharing arrangements with the FDIC) associated with the acquired loans. The allowance associated with our purchased credit impaired loans reflects deterioration in cash flows since acquisition resulting from our quarterly re-estimation of cash flows which involves complex cash flow projections and significant judgment on timing of loan resolution.\nIf our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our current allowance may not be sufficient, and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio. Material additions to the allowance for loan losses would materially decrease our net income and adversely affect our financial condition generally. In addition, federal regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different from our management's. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs required by these regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to higher credit risk by commercial real estate, commercial and industrial and real estate construction lending.\nCommercial real estate, commercial and industrial, and real estate construction lending usually involve higher credit risks than single-family residential lending. As of December 31, 2014, the following loan types accounted for the stated percentages of our total loan portfolio: commercial real estate-35.2%, commercial and industrial-21.2%, and real estate construction-3.3%. As of December 31, 2014, of these loans, 9.0% are covered by loss share agreements with the FDIC. These types of loans involve larger loan balances to a single borrower or groups of related borrowers.\nCommercial real estate loans may be affected to a greater extent than residential loans by adverse conditions in real estate markets or the economy because commercial real estate borrowers' ability to repay their loans depends on successful development of their properties, in addition to the factors affecting residential real estate borrowers. These loans also involve greater risk because they generally are not fully amortizing over the loan period, but have a balloon payment due at maturity. A borrower's ability to make a balloon payment typically will depend on being able to either refinance the loan or sell the underlying property in a timely manner.\nCommercial and industrial loans are typically based on the borrowers' ability to repay the loans from the cash flow of their businesses. These loans may involve greater risk because the availability of funds to repay each loan depends substantially on the success of the business itself. In addition, the\nassets securing the loans have the following characteristics: (a) they depreciate over time, (b) they are difficult to appraise and liquidate, and (c) they fluctuate in value based on the success of the business.\nRisk of loss on a real estate construction loan depends largely upon whether our initial estimate of the property's value at completion of construction equals or exceeds the cost of the property construction (including interest), the availability of permanent take-out financing and the builder's ability to ultimately sell the property. During the construction phase, a number of factors can result in delays and cost overruns. If estimates of value are inaccurate or if actual construction costs exceed estimates, the value of the property securing the loan may be insufficient to ensure full repayment when completed through a permanent loan or by seizure of collateral.\nCommercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, and real estate construction loans are more susceptible to a risk of loss during a downturn in the business cycle. Our underwriting, review and monitoring cannot eliminate all of the risks related to these loans.\nAt December 31, 2014, our outstanding commercial real estate loans were equal to 207.8% of our total risk-based capital. The banking regulators are giving commercial real estate lending greater scrutiny, and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement improved underwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio stress testing, as well as possibly higher levels of allowances for losses and capital levels as a result of commercial real estate lending growth and exposures.\nWe may not be able to retain or develop a strong core deposit base or other low-cost funding sources.\nWe depend on checking, savings and money market deposit account balances and other forms of customer deposits as our primary source of funding for our lending activities. Our future growth will largely depend on our ability to retain and grow a strong deposit base. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain core deposits, to obtain third party financing on favorable terms, or to have access to interbank or other liquidity sources, our cost of funds will increase, adversely affecting the ability to generate the funds necessary for lending operations, reducing net interest margin and negatively affecting results of operations. We derive liquidity through core deposit growth, maturity of money market investments, and maturity and sale of investment securities and loans. Additionally, we have access to financial market borrowing sources on an unsecured and a collateralized basis for both short-term and long-term purposes including, but not limited to, the Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Banks, of which we are a member. If these funding sources are not sufficient or available, we may have to acquire funds through higher-cost sources.\nChanges in local economic conditions where we operate could have a negative effect.\nOur success depends significantly on growth, or lack thereof, in population, income levels, deposits and housing starts in the geographic markets in which we operate. The local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on our commercial, real estate and construction loans, the ability of borrowers to repay these loans, and the value of the collateral securing these loans. Unlike financial institutions that are more geographically diversified, we are a regional banking franchise. Adverse changes in, and further deterioration of, the economic conditions of the Midwest United States in general or in our primary markets in Michigan and Ohio, our other markets in Indiana and Illinois or any one or more of our local markets could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and profitability. A continuing deterioration in economic conditions could result in the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business:\n\u2022 loan delinquencies may increase;\n\u2022 problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022 demand for our products and services may decline; and\n\u2022 collateral for loans that we make, especially real estate, may decline in value, in turn reducing a customer's borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with the our loans.\nWe face strong competition for customers, which could prevent us from obtaining customers or may cause us to pay higher interest rates to attract customer deposits.\nThe banking business is highly competitive, and we experience competition in our markets from many other financial institutions. Customer loyalty can be easily influenced by a competitor's new products, especially offerings that could provide cost savings or a higher return to the customer. Moreover, this competitive industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. We compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds and other mutual funds, as well as super-regional, national and international financial institutions that operate offices in our primary market areas and elsewhere.\nWe compete with these institutions both in attracting deposits and in making loans. In addition, we have to attract our customer base from other existing financial institutions and from new residents. Many of our competitors are well-established, larger financial institutions that may have higher lending limits. Because we will have a lower lending limit than some of our competitors it may discourage borrowers with lending needs that exceed those limits from doing business with us. While we may try to serve these borrowers by selling loan participations to other financial institutions, this strategy may not succeed in this current market because the number of institutions that are willing to act as loan participants is decreasing. We also compete with local community banks in our market. We may not be able to compete successfully with other financial institutions in our market, and we may have to pay higher interest rates to attract deposits, accept lower yields on loans to attract loans and pay higher wages for new employees, resulting in reduced profitability. In addition, competitors that are not depository institutions are generally not subject to the extensive regulations that apply to us.\nWe may also face a competitive disadvantage as a result of our relatively smaller size, lack of significant geographic diversification beyond the Midwest United States and the States of Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois and inability to spread our operating costs across a broader market.\nOur deposit insurance premiums could be substantially higher in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our future earnings.\nThe FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured depository institutions, such as our subsidiary banks, up to $250,000 per account. The amount of a particular institution's deposit insurance assessment is based on that institution's risk classification under an FDIC risk-based assessment system. An institution's risk classification is assigned based on its capital levels and the level of supervisory concern the institution poses to its regulators. Market developments and bank failures in 2008 and the following years significantly depleted the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund, and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits. As a result of these economic conditions and the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, banks are now assessed deposit insurance premiums based on the bank's average consolidated total assets, and the FDIC has modified certain risk-based adjustments which increase or decrease a bank's overall assessment rate. This has resulted in increases to the deposit insurance assessment rates and thus raised deposit premiums for many insured depository institutions. If these increases are insufficient for the Deposit Insurance Fund to meet its funding requirements, further special assessments or increases in deposit insurance premiums may be required. We are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional bank or financial institution failures, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums than the recently increased levels. If our financial condition deteriorates or if the bank regulators otherwise have supervisory concerns about us, then our assessments could rise. Any future additional assessments, increases or required prepayments in FDIC insurance premiums could reduce our profitability, may limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities, or otherwise negatively impact our operations.\nThe accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures could be affected if the judgments, assumptions or estimates used in our critical accounting policies are inaccurate.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosure in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our critical accounting policies, which are included in the section captioned \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in this report, describe those significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that we consider \"critical\" because they require judgments, assumptions and estimates that materially affect our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. As a result, if future events differ significantly from the judgments, assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies, those events or assumptions could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nAny requested or required changes in how we determine the impact of loss share accounting on our financial information could have a material adverse effect on our reported results.\nOur financial results are significantly affected by loss share accounting, which is driven by accounting rule interpretations, assumptions and judgments made by us, and subject to ongoing review by our accountants and the regulatory agencies to whom we report such information. Loss share accounting is a complex accounting methodology. Many of the decisions management makes regarding the application of this accounting methodology are subject to question or revision by our accountants and the various regulatory agencies to whom we report. As such, any financial information generated through the use of loss share accounting is subject to modification or change. Any significant modification or change in such information could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our previously reported results. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in us restating prior period financial statements.\nOur financial information reflects the application of purchase accounting. Any change in the assumptions used in such methodology could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have acquired a significant majority of our assets and assumed a significant majority of our liabilities in our six acquisitions and our financial results are heavily influenced by the application of purchase accounting. Purchase accounting requires management to make assumptions regarding the assets purchased and liabilities assumed to determine their fair value at acquisition. If these assumptions are incorrect or our accountants or the regulatory agencies to whom we report do not concur with our judgments and require that we change or modify our assumptions, such change or modification could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations or our previously reported results.\nThe banking industry is heavily regulated and that regulation or future regulation could limit or restrict our activities and adversely affect our financial results.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and we are subject to examination, supervision, and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services. Our compliance with banking regulations is costly and restricts some of our activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates and locations of offices. We are also subject to capitalization guidelines established by our regulators, which require us to maintain adequate capital to support our business, and, under the Consent Order, Talmer West Bank is subject to heightened capitalization requirements.\nThe burden of regulatory compliance has increased under current legislation and banking regulations and is likely to continue to have or may have a significant impact on the financial services industry. Recent legislative and regulatory changes, as well as changes in regulatory enforcement policies and capital adequacy guidelines, are increasing our costs of doing business and, as a result, may create an advantage for our competitors who may not be subject to similar legislative and regulatory requirements. In addition, future regulatory changes, including changes to regulatory capital requirements, could have an adverse impact on our future results. Furthermore, the federal and state bank regulatory authorities who supervise us have broad discretionary powers to take enforcement actions against banks for failure to comply with applicable regulations and laws. If we fail to comply with applicable laws or regulations, we could become subject to enforcement actions that have a material adverse effect on our future results.\nWe are periodically subject to examination and scrutiny by a number of banking agencies and, depending upon the findings and determinations of these agencies, we may be required to make adjustments to our business that could adversely affect us.\nFederal and state banking agencies periodically conduct examinations of our business, including compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If, as a result of an examination, a banking agency were to determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, asset concentration, earnings prospects, management, liquidity sensitivity to market risk or other aspects of any of our operations has become unsatisfactory, or that we or our management are in violation of any law or regulation, or in the case of Talmer West Bank, the Consent Order, the banking agency could take a number of different remedial actions as it deems appropriate. These actions include the power to enjoin \"unsafe or unsound\" practices, to require affirmative actions to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice, to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced, to direct an increase in our capital, to restrict our growth, to change the asset composition of our portfolio or balance sheet, to assess civil monetary penalties against our officers or directors, to remove officers and directors and, if it is concluded that such conditions cannot be corrected or there is an imminent risk of loss to depositors, to terminate our deposit insurance. If we become subject to such regulatory actions, our business, results of operations and reputation may be negatively impacted.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act may have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOn July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act, which imposes significant regulatory and compliance changes. The key effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business are:\n\u2022 changes to regulatory capital requirements;\n\u2022 exclusion of hybrid securities, including trust preferred securities, issued on or after May 19, 2010 from Tier 1 capital;\n\u2022 creation of new government regulatory agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which develops and enforces rules for bank and non-bank providers of consumer financial products;\n\u2022 limitations on federal preemption;\n\u2022 changes to deposit insurance assessments;\n\u2022 limits on debit interchange fees we earn;\n\u2022 changes in retail banking regulations, including potential limitations on certain fees we may charge; and\n\u2022 changes in regulation of consumer mortgage loan origination and servicing and risk retention.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act restricts the ability of banks to engage in certain proprietary trading or to sponsor or invest in private equity or hedge funds. The Dodd-Frank Act also contains provisions designed to limit the ability of insured depository institutions, their holding companies and their affiliates to conduct certain swaps and derivatives activities and to take certain principal positions in financial instruments.\nSome provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act became effective immediately upon its enactment. Many provisions, however, will require regulations to be promulgated by various federal agencies in order to be implemented, some but not all of which have been proposed or finalized by the applicable federal agencies. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may have unintended effects, which will not be clear until after implementation. Certain changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. While we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, these changes could be materially adverse to investors in our common stock.\nNew capital rules that were recently issued generally require insured depository institutions and their holding companies to hold more capital, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations.\nIn 2013, the Federal Reserve, FDIC and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency adopted capital rules based on the Basel III capital framework. These rules substantially amended the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to us. The rules phase in over time beginning in 2015 and will become fully effective in 2019. The rules apply to the Company as well as our subsidiary banks.\nThe final rules increase capital requirements and generally include two new capital measurements that will affect us, a risk-based common equity Tier 1 ratio and a capital conservation buffer. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital is a subset of Tier 1 capital and is limited to common equity (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income and certain other items. Other instruments that have historically qualified for Tier 1 treatment, including non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, are consigned to a category known as Additional Tier 1 capital and must be phased out of CET1 over a period of nine years beginning in 2014. The rules permit bank holding companies with less than $15 billion in assets (such as us) to continue to include trust preferred securities and non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock issued before May 19, 2010 in Additional Tier 1 capital, but not CET1. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments that have historically been placed in Tier 2, as well as cumulative perpetual preferred stock.\nThe final rules adjust all three categories of capital by requiring new deductions from and adjustments to capital that will result in more stringent capital requirements. Among other things, the current rule on the deduction of mortgage servicing assets from Tier 1 capital has been revised in ways that are likely to require a greater deduction than we currently make and that will require the deduction to be made from CET1. This deduction phases in over a three-year period from 2015 through 2017. We closely monitor our mortgage servicing assets, and we expect to maintain our mortgage servicing asset at levels below the deduction thresholds by a combination of sales of portions of these assets from time to time either on a continuous basis as we originate mortgages or through bulk sale transactions. Additionally, any gains on sale from mortgage loans sold into securitizations must be deducted in full from CET1. This requirement phases in over three years from 2015 through 2017. Under the earlier rule and through 2014, no deduction was required.\nBeginning on January 1, 2015, our new minimum capital requirements are (i) a CET1 ratio of 4.5%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital (CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) of 6% (up from 4%) and (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (the current requirement). Our leverage ratio requirement will remain at the 4% level now required. Beginning in 2016, a capital conservation buffer will phase in over three years, ultimately resulting in a requirement of 2.5% on top of the CET1, Tier 1 and total capital requirements, resulting in a require CET1 ratio of 7%, a Tier 1 ratio of 8.5%, and a total capital ratio of 10.5%. Failure to satisfy any of these three capital requirements will result in limits on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.\nIn addition to the higher required capital ratios and the new deductions and adjustments, the final rules increase the risk weights for certain assets, meaning that we will have to hold more capital against these assets. For example, commercial real estate loans that do not meet certain new underwriting requirements must be risk-weighted at 150%, rather than the current 100%. There are also new risk weights for unsettled transactions and derivatives. We also will be required to hold capital against short-term commitments that are not unconditionally cancelable; currently, there are no capital requirements for these off-balance sheet assets. All changes to the risk weights take effect in 2015.\nIn addition, in the current economic and regulatory environment, bank regulators may impose capital requirements that are more stringent than those required by applicable existing regulations. Talmer West Bank is subject to heightened capital requirements under the Consent Order. The application of more stringent capital requirements for us could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk-based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital or additional capital conservation buffers, could result in management modifying our business strategy and could limit our ability to make distributions, including paying dividends or buying back our shares.\nThe federal banking agencies have proposed new liquidity standards that could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business lines by forcing us to seek new sources of liquidity for them, and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets.\nAs part of the Basel III capital process, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has finalized a new liquidity standard, a liquidity coverage ratio, which requires a banking organization to hold sufficient \"high quality liquid assets\" to meet liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity stress scenario, as well as a net stable funding ratio, which imposes a similar requirement over a one-year period. The U.S. banking regulators have proposed a liquidity coverage ratio for systemically important banks. Although the proposal would not apply directly to us, the substance of the proposal may inform the regulators' assessment of our liquidity. We could be required to reduce our holdings of illiquid assets and adversely affect our results and financial condition. The U.S. regulators have not yet proposed a net stable funding ratio requirement.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations and corresponding enforcement proceedings.\nThe federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (which we refer to as the \"PATRIOT Act\") and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and to file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury Department to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of\nJustice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (which we refer to as \"OFAC\"). Federal and state bank regulators also have begun to focus on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including our acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nFederal, state and local consumer lending laws may restrict our ability to originate certain mortgage loans or increase our risk of liability with respect to such loans and could increase our cost of doing business.\nFederal, state and local laws have been adopted that are intended to eliminate certain lending practices considered \"predatory.\" These laws prohibit practices such as steering borrowers away from more affordable products, selling unnecessary insurance to borrowers, repeatedly refinancing loans and making loans without a reasonable expectation that the borrowers will be able to repay the loans irrespective of the value of the underlying property. Over the course of 2013, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\") has issued several rules on mortgage lending, notably a rule requiring all home mortgage lenders to determine a borrower's ability to repay the loan. The origination of loans with certain terms and conditions and that otherwise meet the definition of a \"qualified mortgage\" may protect us from liability to a borrower for failing to make the necessary determinations. In either case, we may find it necessary to tighten our mortgage loan underwriting standards in response to the CFPB rules, which may constrain our ability to make loans consistent with our business strategies. It is our policy not to make predatory loans and to determine borrowers' ability to repay, but the law and related rules create the potential for increased liability with respect to our lending and loan investment activities. This law increases our cost of doing business and, ultimately, may prevent us from making certain loans and cause us to reduce the average percentage rate or the points and fees on loans that we do make.\nWe are subject to federal and state fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties.\nFederal and state fair lending laws and regulations, such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act, impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions. The Department of Justice, CFPB and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations. Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution's performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation. A successful challenge to our performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact our rating under the Community Reinvestment Act and result in a wide variety of sanctions, including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity, which could negatively impact our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Federal Reserve may require us to commit capital resources to support our subsidiary banks.\nThe Federal Reserve requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the \"source of strength\" doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with\nengaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act directs the federal bank regulators to require that all companies that directly or indirectly control an insured depository institution serve as a source of strength for the institution. Under these requirements, in the future, we could be required to provide financial assistance to our subsidiary banks if they experience financial distress.\nA capital injection may be required at times when we do not have the resources to provide it, and therefore we may be required to borrow the funds. In the event of a bank holding company's bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the holding company's general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and will adversely impact the holding company's cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management's attention and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources, particularly after we are no longer an \"emerging growth company.\" The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management's attention may be diverted from other business concerns, including the integration of our acquired banks, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Although we have already hired additional employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nAs a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition has become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and\noperating results could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers, and systems failures, interruptions or breaches of security could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers. We outsource many of our major systems, such as data processing, loan servicing and deposit processing systems. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to process new and renewal loans, gather deposits and provide customer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we provide our customers the ability to bank remotely, including online over the Internet. The secure transmission of confidential information is a critical element of remote banking. Our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes, spam attacks, human error, natural disasters, power loss and other security breaches. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. Further, we outsource some of the data processing functions used for remote banking, and accordingly we are dependent on the expertise and performance of our third-party providers. To the extent that our activities, the activities of our customers, or the activities of our third-party service providers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations and ability to attract and maintain customers and businesses. In addition, a security breach could also subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability and cause reputational damage.\nWe must respond to rapid technological changes, and these changes may be more difficult or expensive than anticipated.\nWe will have to respond to future technological changes. Specifically, if our competitors introduce new banking products and services embodying new technologies, or if new banking industry standards and practices emerge, then our existing product and service offerings, technology and systems may be impaired or become obsolete. Further, if we fail to adopt or develop new technologies or to adapt our products and services to emerging industry standards, then we may lose current and future customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The financial services industry is changing rapidly, and to remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the functionality and features of our products, services and technologies. These changes may be more difficult or expensive than we anticipate.\nWe are subject to losses due to the errors or fraudulent behavior of employees or third parties.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of fraud by employees and outsiders, clerical recordkeeping errors and transactional errors. Our business is dependent on our employees as well as third-party service providers to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions. We could be materially adversely affected if one of our employees causes a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems or if one of our third-party service providers experiences an operational breakdown or failure. When we originate loans, we rely upon information supplied by loan applicants and third parties, including the information contained in the loan application, property appraisal and title information, if applicable, and employment and income documentation provided by third parties. If any of this information is misrepresented and such misrepresentation is not detected prior to loan funding, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. Any of these occurrences could result in a diminished ability of us to operate our business, potential liability to customers, reputational damage and regulatory intervention, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture growth or operating results may require us to raise additional capital, but that capital may not be available or may be dilutive.\nWe are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. We may at some point need to raise additional capital to support our operations and any future growth.\nOur ability to raise capital will depend on conditions in the capital markets, which are outside of our control and largely do not depend on our financial performance. Accordingly, we may be unable to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, we will be subject to increased regulatory supervision and the imposition of restrictions on our growth and business. These restrictions could negatively affect our ability to operate or further expand our operations through loan growth, acquisitions or the establishment of additional branches. These restrictions may also result in increases in operating expenses and reductions in revenues that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and the price of our common stock.\nShareholders affiliated with one of our directors own a significant percentage of our common stock and may vote their shares in a manner that you may consider not to be consistent with your best interest or the best interest of our shareholders as a whole.\nWLR Recovery Fund IV L.P. and WLR IV Parallel ESC L.P. (the \"WL Ross Funds\"), which have the right to designate one representative to the Company's and Talmer Bank's Boards of Directors and have appointed Denny Kim, a Vice President of WL Ross & Co. LLC, as such director representative, currently beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 13.6% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, the WL Ross Funds, in their capacity as shareholders, have the ability to vote a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock on all matters put to a vote of our shareholders, including the election of our board of directors and certain other significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or acquisition transaction. On any such matter, the interests of the WL Ross Funds may not coincide with the interests of the other holders of our common stock and any such difference in interests may result in the WL Ross Funds voting their shares in a manner inconsistent with the interest of other shareholders of the Company. In addition, it is possible that the WL Ross Funds may sell or otherwise dispose of all or a significant portion of the shares they hold which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nCertain of our directors may have conflicts of interest in determining whether to present business opportunities to us or another entity with which they are, or may become, affiliated.\nCertain of our directors are or may become subject to fiduciary obligations in connection with their service on the boards of directors of other corporations, including financial institutions. A director's association with other financial institutions, which give rise to fiduciary or contractual obligations to such institutions, may create conflicts of interest. To the extent that any of our directors become aware of acquisition opportunities that may be suitable for entities other than us to which they have fiduciary or contractual obligations, or they are presented with such opportunities in their capacities as fiduciaries to such entities, they may honor such obligations to such other entities. You should assume that to the extent any of our directors become aware of an opportunity that may be suitable both for us and another entity to which such person has a fiduciary obligation or contractual obligation to present such opportunity as set forth above, he or she may first give the opportunity to such other entity or entities and may give such opportunity to us only to the extent such other entity or entities reject or are unable to pursue such opportunity. In addition, you should assume that to the extent any of our directors become aware of an acquisition opportunity that does not fall within the above parameters, but that may otherwise be suitable for us, he or she may not present such opportunity to us.\nOur financial condition may be affected negatively by the costs of litigation.\nWe may be involved from time to time in a variety of litigation, investigations or similar matters arising out of our business. In many cases, we may seek reimbursement from our insurance carriers, or with respect to covered assets, from the FDIC to cover such costs and expenses. Our insurance may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation. In addition, there may be limitations on reimbursements from the FDIC with respect to litigation expenses related to covered assets under Talmer Bank's loss share agreements. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements in any litigation or investigation significantly exceed our insurance coverage or anticipated reimbursements from the FDIC, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, nor may we be able to obtain adequate replacement policies with acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe may be adversely affected by the lack of soundness of other financial institutions.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding and other transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial institutions, or the financial services industry generally, may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses of depositor, creditor and counterparty confidence and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions.\nRisks Related to the Acquisition of the Acquired Banks\nWe are subject to risks related to our acquisition transactions.\nThe ultimate success of our past acquisitions, including our acquisition of Signature Bank, and any acquisitions (whether FDIC-assisted or unassisted transactions) in which we may participate in the future will depend on a number of factors, including our ability:\n\u2022 to fully integrate, and to integrate successfully, the branches acquired into our operations;\n\u2022 to limit the outflow of deposits held by our new customers in the acquired branches and to successfully retain and manage interest-earning assets (loans) acquired;\n\u2022 to retain existing deposits and to generate new interest-earning assets in the geographic areas previously served by the acquired banks;\n\u2022 to effectively compete in new markets in which we did not previously have a presence;\n\u2022 to comply with the regulatory burdens associated with FDIC-assisted acquisitions;\n\u2022 to control the incremental non-interest expense from the acquired branches in a manner that enables us to maintain a favorable overall efficiency ratio;\n\u2022 to retain and attract the appropriate personnel to staff the acquired branches;\n\u2022 to earn acceptable levels of interest and non-interest income, including fee income, from the acquired branches; and\n\u2022 to reasonably estimate cash flows for acquired loans to mitigate exposure greater than estimated losses at the time of acquisition.\nAs with any acquisition involving a financial institution, there may be higher than average levels of service disruptions that would cause inconveniences to our new customers or potentially increase the effectiveness of competing financial institutions in attracting our customers. We anticipate challenges and opportunities because of the unique nature of each acquisition. Integration efforts will also likely divert our management's attention and resources. We may be unable to integrate acquired branches successfully, and the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisition transactions. We may also encounter unexpected difficulties or costs during the integration that could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition, perhaps materially. Additionally, we may be unable to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by our existing banking business, to compete effectively in the market areas previously served by the acquired branches or to manage effectively any growth resulting from our acquisition transactions.\nOur ability to continue to receive the benefits of our loss share arrangements with the FDIC is conditioned upon our compliance with certain requirements under the agreements.\nWe are the beneficiary of loss share agreements with the FDIC that call for the FDIC to fund a portion of our losses on a majority of the assets we acquired in connection with our FDIC-assisted transactions. To recover a portion of our losses and retain the loss share protection, we must comply with certain requirements imposed by the agreements. The requirements of the agreements relate primarily to our administration of the assets covered by the agreements. Any failure to comply with the requirements of the loss share agreements, or to properly service the loans and other real estate owned covered by the agreements may cause such covered loans and other real estate to lose their eligibility for loss share reimbursement payments from the FDIC, resulting in material losses that are currently not anticipated. In addition, under the loss share agreements, we are subject to audits by the FDIC through its designated agent to monitor our compliance with the agreements. As the loan servicing standards evolve, we may experience difficulties in complying with the requirements of the loss share agreements.\nIn addition, under the loss share agreements, we must obtain the consent of the FDIC to engage in certain corporate transactions that may be deemed under the agreements to constitute a transfer of the loss share benefits. For example, any merger or consolidation of the Company or Talmer Bank with or into another company, if the shareholders of the Company or Talmer Bank will own less than 66.66% of the consolidated entity, requires the consent of the FDIC. When the consent of the FDIC is required under the loss share agreements, the FDIC may withhold its consent or may condition its consent on terms that we do not find acceptable. If the FDIC does not grant its consent to a\ntransaction we would like to pursue, or conditions its consent on terms that we do not find acceptable, we may be unable to engage in a corporate transaction that might otherwise benefit our shareholders or we may elect to pursue such a transaction without obtaining the FDIC's consent, which could result in termination of our loss share agreements with the FDIC which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe accounting for loans acquired in connection with our acquisitions is based on numerous subjective determinations that may prove to be inaccurate and have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nThe loans we acquired in connection with our acquisitions have been recorded at their estimated fair value on the respective acquisition date without a carryover of the related allowance for loan losses. In general, the determination of estimated fair value of acquired loans requires management to make subjective determinations regarding discount rate, estimates of losses on defaults, market conditions and other factors that are highly subjective in nature. Although we have recorded fair value adjustments, based on our estimates at the date of acquisition, the loans we acquired may become impaired or may further deteriorate in value, resulting in additional losses and charge-offs to the loan portfolio. The fluctuations in national, regional and local economic conditions, including those related to local residential, commercial real estate and construction markets, may increase the level of charge-offs that we make to our loan portfolio and consequently reduce our capital. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled and may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition even if other favorable events occur.\nLoans acquired in connection with acquisitions that have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at the date of acquisition that we will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments are accounted for under ASC Topic 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality, or ASC 310-30. These credit-impaired loans, like non-credit-impaired loans acquired in connection with our acquisitions, have been recorded at their estimated fair value on the respective acquisition date, based on subjective determinations regarding risk ratings, expected future cash flows and fair value of the underlying collateral, without a carryover of the related allowance for loan losses. We evaluate these loans quarterly to assess expected cash flows. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows will generally result in a provision for loan losses. Subsequent increases in cash flows result in a reversal of the provision for loan losses to the extent of prior charges or a reclassification of the difference from non-accretable to accretable with a positive impact on interest income. Because the accounting for these loans is based on subjective measures that can change frequently, we may experience fluctuations in our net interest income and provisions for loan losses attributable to these loans. These fluctuations could negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur loss sharing arrangements with the FDIC will not cover all of our losses on loans we acquired in our four FDIC-assisted transactions.\nAlthough we have entered into loss share agreements with the FDIC that provide that the FDIC will bear a significant portion of losses related to specified loan portfolios that we acquired in our four FDIC-assisted transactions, we are not protected for all losses resulting from charge-offs with respect to those specified loan portfolios. Additionally, the loss sharing agreements have limited terms (ten years for losses on single-family residential real estate loans, five years for losses on non-residential real estate loans and eight years with respect to recoveries on non-residential real estate loans). Therefore, the FDIC will not reimburse us for any charge-off or related losses that we experience after the term of the loss share agreements, and any such charge-offs would negatively impact our net income. Moreover, the loss share provisions in the loss share agreement may be administered improperly, or the FDIC may interpret those provisions in a way different than we do. In any of those events, our losses could increase.\nThe FDIC requires that we make a \"true-up\" payment to the FDIC in connection with certain of our FDIC-assisted transactions if our realized losses are less than expected.\nThe loss share agreements between Talmer Bank and the FDIC with respect to the acquisition of CF Bancorp, First Banking Center and Peoples State Bank contain a provision that obligates us to make a \"true-up\" payment to the FDIC if the realized losses of each of these acquired banks are less than expected. The \"true-up\" calculation is scheduled to be made as of the 45th day following the last day of the calendar month of the tenth anniversary of the closing of the acquisition of CF Bancorp, the tenth anniversary of the closing of the acquisition of First Banking Center, and the tenth anniversary of the closing of the acquisition of Peoples State Bank. We estimate the present value of any such \"true-up\" payment and record the current estimate as \"FDIC clawback liability\" on our consolidated balance sheets. Any \"true-up\" payment that is materially higher than our recorded estimate could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nShares of our common stock are subject to dilution.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had 70,532,122 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. As of December 31, 2014, we had warrants outstanding to purchase 2,568,271 shares of our Class A common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $6.77 per share (of which 2,529,416 were repurchased by us in February 2015), warrants outstanding to purchase 390,000 shares of our Class B common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $6.00 per share, options to purchase 7,958,108 shares of our Class A common stock with a weighted average exercise price of $6.96 per share and 1,227,772 unallocated shares under our Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, that remain available for future grants. The vesting and terms of options granted are determined by our Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. A significant portion of our options time-vest over a three year period from the date of grant and expire ten years after the date of the grant. Unless earlier exercised or terminated pursuant to the terms of the grant, 462,924 expire in 2019, 3,015,000 expire in 2020, 998,184 expire in 2021, 3,447,000 expire in 2023 and 35,000 expire in 2024. The issuance of shares subject to warrants and options under the plan will further dilute your ownership of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline due to the large number of outstanding shares of our common stock eligible for future sale.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. These sales could also make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future, at a time and place that we deem appropriate.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had 70,532,122 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Of the outstanding shares of common stock, all of the 17,888,888 shares that were sold in our initial public offering are freely tradable, except that any shares purchased by \"affiliates\" (as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (which we refer to as the \"Securities Act\"), only may be sold in compliance with certain limitations. The remaining 52,643,234 shares of our common stock outstanding may be sold into the market over time in transactions made in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act or otherwise in future public offerings. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected by actual or anticipated sales of a significant number of shares of our common stock in the future.\nWe may issue shares of preferred stock that would adversely affect the rights of our common shareholders.\nOur authorized capital stock includes 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock of which no preferred shares are issued and outstanding. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may designate and\nissue one or more series of preferred stock from the authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock. Subject to limitations imposed by law or our articles of incorporation, our board of directors is empowered to determine:\n\u2022 the designation of, and the number of, shares constituting each series of preferred stock;\n\u2022 the dividend rate for each series;\n\u2022 the terms and conditions of any voting, conversion and exchange rights for each series;\n\u2022 the amounts payable on each series on redemption or our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up;\n\u2022 the provisions of any sinking fund for the redemption or purchase of shares of any series; and\n\u2022 the preferences and the relative rights among the series of preferred stock.\nWe could issue preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the shares of our common stock and with preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends and in liquidation.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, which could cause the value of an investment in our common stock to decline.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022 general market conditions;\n\u2022 domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022 changes in or failure to meet publicly disclosed expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u2022 downgrades in securities analysts' estimates of our financial performance or lack of research and reports by industry analysts;\n\u2022 changes in market valuations or earnings of similar companies;\n\u2022 the expiration of contractual lock-up agreements;\n\u2022 any future sales of our common stock or other securities; and\n\u2022 additions or departures of key personnel.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These types of broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In the past, shareholders have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. Any similar litigation against us could result in substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources and harm our business or results of operations. For example, we are currently operating in, and have benefited from, a protracted period of historically low interest rates that will not be sustained indefinitely, and future fluctuations in interest rates could cause an increase in volatility of the market price of our common stock.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company\" and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company,\" as defined in the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are generally unavailable to other public companies. As an emerging growth company,\n\u2022 we are exempt from the requirements to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on management's assessment of our internal control over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u2022 we are permitted to have less extensive disclosure regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; and\n\u2022 we are not required to seek from our shareholders a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation or golden parachute payments.\nWe may take advantage of some or all of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available to us as long as we continue to qualify as an emerging growth company. It is possible that some investors could find our common stock less attractive because we may take advantage of these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards affecting public companies. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected not to take advantage of this extended transition period, which means the financial statements included in this report, as well as financial statements we file in the future, will be subject to all new or revised accounting standards generally applicable to public companies. Our election not to take advantage of the extended transition period is irrevocable.\nWe could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years from our initial public offering in February 2014, or until the earliest of (a) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (b) the date that the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (c) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period.\nCertain provisions of our loss sharing agreements may have anti-takeover effects and could limit our ability and the ability of our shareholders to engage in certain transactions.\nThe loss share agreements we entered into with the FDIC in connection with our four FDIC-assisted acquisitions require that we receive prior FDIC consent, which may be withheld by the FDIC in its sole discretion, prior to us or our shareholders engaging in certain transactions, including those that may otherwise be in their best interests. If any such transaction is completed without prior FDIC consent, the FDIC would have the right to discontinue the loss sharing arrangement with us.\nAmong other things, prior FDIC consent is required for (1) a merger or consolidation of us with or into another company if our shareholders will own less than 66.66% of the combined company, or of our bank subsidiary with or into another company, if we will own less than 66.66% of the combined company, (2) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of our bank subsidiary and (3) a sale of shares by a shareholder, or a group of related shareholders, that will effect a change in control of our bank subsidiary, as determined by the FDIC with reference to the standards set forth in the Change in\nBank Control Act of 1978, as amended (generally, the acquisition of between 10% and 25% of our voting securities where the presumption of control is not rebutted, or the acquisition by any person, acting directly or indirectly or through or in concert with one or more persons, of more than 25% of our voting securities). If we or any shareholder desired to enter into any such transaction, the FDIC may not grant its consent in a timely manner, without conditions, or at all. If one of these transactions were to occur without prior FDIC consent and the FDIC withdrew its loss share arrangement with us, we could be materially and adversely affected.\nAnti-takeover provisions in the corporate statutes and charter documents governing our organization could discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of the Company and diminish the value of our common stock.\nSome of the provisions of the Michigan Business Corporation Act (\"MBCA\") and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could make it difficult for our shareholders to change the composition of our board of directors, preventing them from changing the composition of management. In addition, the same provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our shareholders may consider favorable.\nThese provisions include the following:\n\u2022 Chapter 7A of the MBCA, which imposes restrictions and requirements on investors in our voting shares above specified ownership percentages or who propose to enter into a business combination (as defined in the MBCA) with us; in some instances, the board of directors is vested with discretion to determine selectively which shareholders are, or are not, subject to these restrictions and requirements;\n\u2022 the board of directors is authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to establish the preferences and rights (including the right to vote and the right to convert into shares of common stock) of any shares issued without shareholder approval;\n\u2022 limitations on the rights of shareholders to remove directors and the ability of incumbent directors to increase the size of the board and fill vacancies on the board; and\n\u2022 limitations on the rights of shareholders to call special meetings of the shareholders and propose business or nominate candidates for election to our board of directors at annual and special meetings of the shareholders.\nThese anti-takeover provisions could impede the ability of our common shareholders to benefit from a change of control and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on the value of our common stock and your ability to realize any potential change-in-control premium.\nShareholders may be deemed to be acting in concert or otherwise in control of us and our bank subsidiaries, which could impose prior approval requirements and result in adverse regulatory consequences for such holders.\nWe are a bank holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve. Any entity (including a \"group\" composed of natural persons) owning 25% or more of a class of our outstanding shares of voting stock, or a lesser percentage if such holder or group otherwise exercises a \"controlling influence\" over us, may be subject to regulation as a \"bank holding company\" in accordance with the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. In addition, (1) any bank holding company or foreign bank with a U.S. presence is required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act to acquire or retain 5% or more of a class of our outstanding shares of voting stock, and (2) any person other than a bank holding company may be required to obtain prior regulatory approval under the Change in Bank Control Act to acquire or retain 10% or more of our outstanding shares of voting stock. Any shareholder that is deemed to \"control\" the Company for bank regulatory purposes\nwould become subject to prior approval requirements and ongoing regulation and supervision. Such a holder may be required to divest amounts equal to or exceeding 5% of the voting shares of investments that may be deemed incompatible with bank holding company status, such as an investment in a company engaged in non-financial activities. Regulatory determination of \"control\" of a depository institution or holding company is based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances. Potential investors are advised to consult with their legal counsel regarding the applicable regulations and requirements.\nOur common stock owned by holders determined by a bank regulatory agency to be acting in concert would be aggregated for purposes of determining whether those holders have control of a bank or bank holding company. Each shareholder obtaining control that is a \"company\" would be required to register as a bank holding company. \"Acting in concert\" generally means knowing participation in a joint activity or parallel action towards the common goal of acquiring control of a bank or a parent company, whether or not pursuant to an express agreement. The manner in which this definition is applied in individual circumstances can vary and cannot always be predicted with certainty. Many factors can lead to a finding of acting in concert, including where: (i) the shareholders are commonly controlled or managed; (ii) the shareholders are parties to an oral or written agreement or understanding regarding the acquisition, voting or transfer of control of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company; (iii) the shareholders are immediate family members; or (iv) both a shareholder and a controlling shareholder, partner, trustee or management official of such shareholder own equity in the bank or bank holding company.\nOur ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory limitations and each of our subsidiary bank's ability to pay dividends to us is also subject to regulatory limitations.\nOur ability to pay dividends is subject to restrictions under applicable banking laws and regulations, and depends upon the results of operations of our subsidiary banks. The Company is a bank holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through Talmer Bank and Talmer West Bank. As a result, our ability to make dividend payments on our common stock depends primarily on certain federal regulatory considerations and the receipt of dividends and other distributions from our subsidiary banks.\nBanks and bank holding companies are subject to certain regulatory restrictions on the payment of cash dividends. In addition, the Federal bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business. The payment of dividends could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice if such dividends are not supported by recent earnings or we or our subsidiary banks do not, in the view of the regulators, have sufficient capital. Our ability to pay dividends will directly depend on the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends. Under the Consent Order, Talmer West Bank is prohibited from paying any dividends without obtaining prior regulatory approval of the FDIC and the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services.\nFinally, holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may, in its unilateral discretion, declare out of funds legally available for such purpose based on a variety of considerations, including, without limitation, our historical and projected financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, capital levels, tax considerations, statutory and regulatory prohibitions and other limitations, general economic conditions and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they publish reports with unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price and trading volume of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock is expected to be impacted in part by research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts. Equity research analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our common stock, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. If equity research analysts do provide research coverage of our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline if one or more of these analysts downgrade our common stock or if they issue other unfavorable commentary about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of the Company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our common stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur securities are not FDIC insured.\nOur securities, including our common stock, are not savings or deposit accounts or other obligations of our subsidiary banks, are not insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund, the FDIC or any other governmental agency and are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal.", "PERMNO": 14471, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "TLMR"}
