{"cik": "1038773", "company": "SMARTFINANCIAL INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves various risks which are particular to SmartFinancial, its industry, and its market area. Several risk factors regarding investing in our securities are discussed below. This listing should not be considered as all-inclusive. If any of the following risks were to occur, we may not be able to conduct our business as currently planned and our financial condition or operating results could be negatively impacted. These matters could cause the trading price of our securities to decline in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur net interest income could be negatively affected by interest rate adjustments by the Federal Reserve Board.\nAs a financial institution, our earnings are dependent upon our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on interest-earning assets, such as investment securities and loans, and the interest expense that we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Therefore, any change in general market interest rates, including changes resulting from changes in the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s policies, affects us more than non-financial institutions and can have a significant effect on our net interest income and total income. Our assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions because there may be mismatches between the repricing or maturity characteristics of our assets and liabilities. As a result, an increase or decrease in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net interest margin and results of operations. Actions by monetary and fiscal authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board, could have an adverse effect on our deposit levels, loan demand, business and results of operations.\nThe Federal Reserve Board raised interest rates by 100 basis points since December 2016 after having held interest rates at almost zero over recent years. However, the consistently low rate environment has negatively impacted our net interest margin, notwithstanding decreases in nonperforming loans and improvements in deposit mix. Any reduction in net interest income will negatively affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and/or cash flows.\nChanges in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate loans, the value of our assets, and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which ultimately affect our earnings. A decline in the market value of our assets may limit our ability to borrow additional funds. As a result, we could be required to sell some of our loans and investments under adverse market conditions, upon terms that are not favorable to us, in order to maintain our liquidity. If those sales are made at prices lower than the amortized costs of the investments, we will incur losses.\nThe primary tool that management uses to measure short-term interest rate risk is a net interest income simulation model prepared by an independent third party provider. As of December 31, 2017, SmartFinancial is considered to be in an asset-sensitive position, meaning income is generally expected to increase with an increase in short-term interest rates and, conversely, to decrease with a decrease in short-term interest rates. Based on the results of this simulation model, which assumed a static environment with no contemplated asset growth or changes in our balance sheet management strategies, if short-term interest rates immediately increased by 200 basis points, we could expect net income to increase by approximately $4.0 million over a 12-month period. This result is primarily due to the floating rate securities and loans which we anticipate would reprice at a quicker rate than our interest bearing liabilities. The actual amount of any increase or decrease may be higher or lower than predicted by our simulation model.\nThe final Basel III capital rules generally require insured depository institutions and their holding companies to hold more capital, which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations.\nIn July 2013, the federal banking agencies published new regulatory capital rules based on the international standards, known as Basel III, that had been developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The new rules raised the risk-based capital requirements and revised the methods for calculating risk-weighted assets, usually resulting in higher risk weights. The new rules became effective on January 1, 2015, with a phase in period that generally extends from January 1, 2015 through January 1, 2019.\nThe Basel III-based rules increase capital requirements and include two new capital measurements that will affect us, a risk-based common equity Tier 1 ratio and a capital conservation buffer. As an example, the Tier 1 capital ratio minimum requirement of 4 percent on January 1, 2015 will increase to 8.5 percent by 2019. SmartFinancial has approximately $157.8 million of Tier 1 capital. Under the previous standard, we could have grown SmartBank's total asset size to approximately $3.9 billion with our current capital but will be limited to $1.9 billion in assets under the new Basel III standards to be fully phased in by 2019. In 2017, 91 percent of our average assets were earning assets and over 90 percent of our revenue was generated from net interest income. Therefore, a future reduction of potential earning assets by approximately 53 percent could drastically reduce our future income. More details about the new capital requirements can be found in Note 13 in the \u201cNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers, and systems failures, interruptions or breaches of security could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify these systems as circumstances warrant, the security of our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact. We outsource many of our major systems, such as data processing, loan servicing and deposit processing systems. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to process new and renewal loans, gather deposits and provide customer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we provide our customers the ability to bank remotely, including over the Internet or through their mobile device. The secure transmission of confidential information is a critical element of remote and mobile banking. Our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes, spam attacks, human error, natural disasters, power loss and other security breaches. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches or viruses. To the extent that our activities or the activities of our customers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches (including breaches of security of customer systems and networks) and viruses could expose us to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations and ability to attract and maintain customers and businesses. In addition, a security breach could also subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability and cause reputational damage.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nIf our allowance for loan and lease losses and fair value adjustments with respect to acquired loans is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will be adversely affected.\nOur success depends significantly on the quality of our assets, particularly loans. Like other financial institutions, we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers may not repay their loans according to their terms, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to fully compensate us for the outstanding balance of the loan plus the costs to dispose of the collateral. As a result, we may experience significant loan losses that may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses with respect to our loan portfolio, in an attempt to cover loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio. In determining the size of the allowance, we rely on an analysis of our loan portfolio, our experience and our evaluation of general economic conditions. We also make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the diversification in our loan portfolio, the effect of changes in the economy on real estate and other collateral values, the results of recent regulatory examinations, the effects on the loan portfolio of current economic conditions and their probable impact on borrowers, the amount of charge-offs for the period and the amount of nonperforming loans and related collateral security.\nThe application of the acquisition method of accounting in our acquisitions has impacted our allowance for loan and lease losses. Under the acquisition method of accounting, all acquired loans were recorded in our consolidated financial statements at their fair values at the time of acquisition and the related allowance for loan and lease losses was eliminated because credit quality, among other factors, was considered in the determination of fair value. To the extent that our estimates of fair values are too high, we will incur losses associated with the acquired loans. The allowance, if any, associated with our purchased credit impaired loans reflects deterioration in cash flows since acquisition resulting from our quarterly re-estimation of cash flows which involves complex cash flow projections and significant judgment on timing of loan resolution.\nIf our analysis or assumptions prove to be incorrect, our current allowance may not be sufficient, and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in our loan portfolio. Material additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses would materially decrease our net income and adversely affect our general financial condition. As an example, an increase in the amount of the reserve to organic loans of 0.05 percent in 2017 would have resulted in a reduction of approximately 3 percent to pre-tax income.\nIn addition, federal and state regulators periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require us to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of our management. Any increase in our allowance for loan and lease losses or loan charge-offs required by these regulatory agencies could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur success depends significantly on economic conditions in our market areas.\nUnlike larger organizations that are more geographically diversified, our branches are currently concentrated in Eastern Tennessee and the Florida Panhandle. As a result of this geographic concentration, our financial results will depend largely upon economic conditions in these market areas. If the communities in which we operate do not grow or if prevailing economic conditions, locally or nationally, deteriorate, this may have a significant impact on the amount of loans that we originate, the ability of our borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. A return to economic downturn conditions caused by inflation, recession, unemployment, government action, natural disasters or other factors beyond our control would likely contribute to the deterioration of the quality of our loan portfolio and reduce our level of deposits, which in turn would have an adverse effect on our business. As an example, the Florida Panhandle area has been and will continue to be susceptible to major hurricanes, floods, and tropical storms. In 2016, certain of our markets in Eastern Tennessee were disrupted by wildfires which damaged homes and businesses. In addition, some portions of our target market are in areas which a substantial portion of the economy is dependent upon tourism. The tourism industry tends to be more sensitive than the economy as a whole to changes in unemployment, inflation, wage growth, and other factors which affect consumer\u2019s financial condition and sentiment.\nOur organic loan growth may be limited by regulatory constraints\nDuring 2017 many of the regulatory agencies, including ours, increased their focus on the application of an interagency guidance issued in 2006, titled \u201cConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices.\u201d The 2006 interagency guidance focuses on the risks of high levels of concentration in CRE lending at banking institutions, and specifically addresses two supervisory criteria:\n\u2022\nConstruction concentration criterion: Loans for construction, land, and land development (CLD or \u201cconstruction\u201d) represent 100 percent or more of a banking institution\u2019s total risk-based capital, commonly referred to as the \"100 ratio\"\n\u2022\nTotal CRE concentration criterion: Total nonowner-occupied CRE loans (including CLD loans), as defined in the 2006 guidance (\u201ctotal CRE\u201d), represent 300 percent or more of the institution\u2019s total risk-based capital, and growth in total CRE lending has increased by 50 percent or more during the previous 36 months, commonly referred to as the \"300 ratio\"\nThe guidance states that banking institutions exceeding the concentration levels mentioned in the two supervisory criteria should have in place enhanced credit risk controls, including stress testing of CRE portfolios. The guidance also states that institutions with CRE concentration levels above those specified in the two supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis. Under the guidance for every $1 in increased capital only $1 can be leveraged to construction lending and only $3 can be lent to total CRE lending. In comparison $1 of capital can be leveraged into about $10 other types of lending. At the end of 2017 our loan portfolio was below both the 100 and 300 ratio as laid out in the guidance, but given the guidance our ability to grow those loan types could well be constrained by the amount we are also able to grow capital.\nTo the extent that we are unable to identify and consummate attractive acquisitions, or increase loans through organic loan growth, we may be unable to successfully implement our growth strategy, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nA substantial part of our historical growth has been a result of acquisitions and we intend to continue to grow our business through strategic acquisitions of banking franchises coupled with organic loan growth. Previous availability of attractive acquisition targets may not be indicative of future acquisition opportunities, and we may be unable to identify any acquisition targets that meet our investment objectives. To the extent that we are unable to find suitable acquisition candidates, an important component of our strategy may be lost. If we are able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we must generally satisfy a number of conditions prior to completing any such transaction, including certain bank regulatory approvals, which have become substantially more difficult, time-consuming and unpredictable as a result of the recent financial crisis. Additionally, any future acquisitions may not produce the revenue, earnings or synergies that we anticipated. As our purchased credit impaired loan portfolio, which produces substantially higher yields than our organic and purchased non-credit impaired loan portfolios, is paid down, we expect downward pressure on our income. If we are unable to replace our purchased credit impaired loans and the related accretion with a significantly higher level of new performing loans and other earning assets due to our inability to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, a decline in loan demand, competition from other financial institutions in our markets, stagnation or continued deterioration of economic conditions, or other conditions, our financial condition and earnings may be adversely affected.\nOur strategic growth plan contemplates additional acquisitions, which could expose us to additional risks.\nWe periodically evaluate opportunities to acquire additional financial institutions. As a result, we may engage in negotiations or discussions that, if they were to result in a transaction, could have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition, including short and long-term liquidity. Our acquisition activities could be material and could require us to use a substantial amount of common stock, cash, other liquid assets, and/or incur debt.\nOur acquisition activities could involve a number of additional risks, including the risks of:\n\u2022\nincurring time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and negotiating potential transactions, resulting in management's attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business;\n\u2022\nusing inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution or assets;\n\u2022\nincurring time and expense required to integrate the operations and personnel of the combined businesses, creating an adverse short-term effect on results of operations; and\n\u2022\nlosing key employees and customers as a result of an acquisition that is poorly received.\nOur recent acquisition and future expansion may result in additional risks.\nOver the last three years we have completed the acquisitions of Legacy SmartFinancial and Capstone, and we anticipate consummating our proposed merger with Tennessee Bancshares in the second quarter of 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. We expect to continue to expand in our current markets and in other select markets through additional branches or through additional acquisitions of all or part of other financial institutions. These types of expansions involve various risks, including the risks detailed below.\nGrowth. As a result of our merger activity, we may be unable to successfully:\n\u2022\nmaintain loan quality in the context of significant loan growth;\n\u2022\nobtain regulatory and other approvals;\n\u2022\nattract sufficient deposits and capital to fund anticipated loan growth;\n\u2022\nmaintain adequate common equity and regulatory capital;\n\u2022\navoid diversion or disruption of our existing operations or management as well as those of the acquired institution;\n\u2022\nmaintain adequate management personnel and systems to oversee and support such growth;\n\u2022\nmaintain adequate internal audit, loan review and compliance functions; and\n\u2022\nimplement additional policies, procedures and operating systems required to support such growth.\nResults of Operations. There is no assurance that existing offices or future offices will maintain or achieve deposit levels, loan balances or other operating results necessary to avoid losses or produce profits. Our growth strategy necessarily entails growth in overhead expenses as we routinely add new offices and staff. Our historical results may not be indicative of future results or results that may be achieved as we continue to increase the number and concentration of our branch offices in our newer markets.\nDevelopment of offices. There are considerable costs involved in opening branches, and new branches generally do not generate sufficient revenues to offset their costs until they have been in operation for at least a year or more. Accordingly, any new branches we establish can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until they reach certain economies of scale. The same is true for our efforts to expand in these markets with the hiring of additional seasoned professionals with significant experience in that market. Our expenses could be further increased if we encounter delays in opening any of our new branches. We may be unable to accomplish future branch expansion plans due to a lack of available satisfactory sites, difficulties in acquiring such sites, failure to receive any required regulatory approvals, increased expenses or loss of potential sites due to complexities associated with zoning and permitting processes, higher than anticipated merger and acquisition costs or other factors. Finally, we have no assurance any branch will be successful even after it has been established or acquired, as the case may be.\nRegulatory and economic factors. Our growth and expansion plans may be adversely affected by a number of regulatory and economic developments or other events. Failure to obtain required regulatory approvals, changes in laws and regulations or other regulatory developments and changes in prevailing economic conditions or other unanticipated events may prevent or adversely affect our continued growth and expansion. Such factors may cause us to alter our growth and expansion plans or slow or halt the growth and expansion process, which may prevent us from entering into or expanding in our targeted markets or allow competitors to gain or retain market share in our existing markets.\nFailure to successfully address these and other issues related to our expansion could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Also, if our growth occurs more slowly than anticipated or declines, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nIntegrating Capstone Bank and, if our pending merger with Tennessee Bancshares is completed, Southern Community Bank into SmartBank\u2019s may be more difficult, costly, or time-consuming than anticipated.\nWe are still in the process of integrating Capstone Bank\u2019s business with that of SmartBank, and if the merger with Tennessee Bancshares is completed as planned, we will begin the process of integrating Southern Community Bank with that of SmartBank as well. A successful integration of these businesses with ours will depend substantially on our ability to consolidate operations, corporate cultures, systems and procedures and to eliminate redundancies and costs. We may not be able to combine our business with one or both of the targets\u2019 businesses without encountering difficulties, such as:\n\u2022\nthe loss of key employees;\n\u2022\ndisruption of operations and business;\n\u2022\ninability to maintain and increase competitive presence;\n\u2022\nloan and deposit attrition, customer loss and revenue loss, including as a result of any decision we may make to close one or more locations;\n\u2022\npossible inconsistencies in standards, control procedures and policies;\n\u2022\nunexpected problems with costs, operations, personnel, technology and credit; and/or\n\u2022\nproblems with the assimilation of new operations, sites or personnel, which could divert resources from regular banking operations.\nAdditionally, general market and economic conditions or governmental actions affecting the financial industry generally may inhibit our successful integration of one or both of the targets\u2019 businesses. Further, we acquired Capstone and intend to acquire Tennessee Bancshares with the expectation that the acquisitions will result in various benefits including, among other things, benefits relating to enhanced revenues, a strengthened market position for the combined company, cross selling opportunities, technological efficiencies, cost savings and operating efficiencies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of this acquisition is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether we integrate Capstone\u2019s and/or Southern Community Bank\u2019s businesses, including\nits organizational culture, operations, technologies, services and products, in an efficient and effective manner, our ability to achieve the estimated noninterest expense savings we believe we can achieve, and general competitive factors in the marketplace. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits on the anticipated timeframe, or at all, could result in a reduction in the price of our shares as well as in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we made fair value estimates of certain assets and liabilities in recording our acquisition of Capstone and will make fair value estimates of certain assets and liabilities in recording our acquisition of Southern Community Bank. Actual values of these assets and liabilities could differ from our estimates, which could result in our not achieving the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Finally, any cost savings that are realized may be offset by losses in revenues or other charges to earnings.\nWe may face risks with respect to future acquisitions.\nWhen we attempt to expand our business through mergers and acquisitions (as we have done over the last three years), we seek targets that are culturally similar to us, have experienced management and possess either market presence or have potential for improved profitability through economies of scale or expanded services. In addition to the general risks associated with our growth plans which are highlighted above, in general acquiring other banks, businesses or branches, particularly those in markets with which we are less familiar, involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisition and merger targets;\n\u2022\ninaccuracies in the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution;\n\u2022\nthe time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local management, including as a result of de novo expansion into a market, and opening new bank locations, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the significant costs of the expansion that we may incur, particularly in the first 12 to 24 months of operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention to the negotiation of a transaction and integration of an acquired company\u2019s operations with ours;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of an impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and adverse effects on our results of operations;\n\u2022\nentry into new markets where we have limited or no direct prior experience;\n\u2022\nclosing delays and increased expenses related to the resolution of lawsuits filed by our shareholders or shareholders of companies we may seek to acquire;\n\u2022\nthe inability to receive regulatory approvals timely or at all, including as a result of community objections, or such approvals being restrictively conditional; and\n\u2022\nrisks associated with integrating the operations, technologies and personnel of the acquired business.\nWe expect to continue to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities that are presented to us in our current markets as well as other markets throughout the region and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash or equity securities and related capital raising transactions may occur at any time. Generally, acquisitions of financial institutions involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our book value and fully diluted earnings per share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in product presence and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we may face significant competition from numerous other financial services institutions, many of which may have greater financial resources than we do, when considering acquisition opportunities. Accordingly, attractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing any potential future acquisitions.\nOur concentration in loans secured by real estate, particularly commercial real estate and construction and development, is subject to risks that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe offer a variety of secured loans, including commercial lines of credit, commercial term loans, real estate, construction, home equity, consumer and other loans. Many of our loans are secured by real estate (both residential and commercial) in our market areas. Consequently, declines in economic conditions in these market areas may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are more geographically diverse.\nAt December 31, 2017, approximately 81 percent of our loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral, with 11 percent of our loans secured by construction and development collateral. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values, our earnings and capital could be adversely affected. Real estate values declined significantly during the recent economic crisis and may decline similarly in future periods. Although real estate prices in most of our markets have stabilized or are improving, a renewed decline in real estate values would expose us to further deterioration in the value of the collateral for all loans secured by real estate and may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nCommercial real estate loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans, particularly when there is a downturn in the business cycle. They are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans and depend on cash flows from the owner\u2019s business or the property to service the debt. Cash flows may be affected significantly by general economic conditions and a downturn in the local economy or in occupancy rates in the local economy where the property is located, each of which could increase the likelihood of default on the loan. Because our loan portfolio contains a number of commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in the percentage of nonperforming loans. An increase in nonperforming loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans, an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in charge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, which could negatively affect our stock price.\nIf a commercial real estate loan did default there would be legal expenses associated with obtaining the real estate which is typically collateral for the loan. In the last several years the amount of these legal expenses has been low, compared to periods when the defaults of commercial real estate loans have been higher. Once we obtain the collateral for the commercial real estate loan it is put into foreclosed assets. Foreclosed assets generally do not produce income but do have the costs associated with the ownership of real estate, principally real estate taxes and maintenance costs. Since these assets have a cost to maintain our goal is to keep costs at a minimum by liquidating the assets as soon as possible. Generally, in spite of our best efforts and intentions, foreclosed assets are sold at a loss. Among other reasons the rate of loan defaults increase as the economy worsens and declining economic environment and political turmoil generally results in downward pressure on foreclosed asset values and increased marketing periods. In simple terms for banks like ours who have a large amount of commercial real estate loans a worsening economy will typically lead to higher loan delinquencies, followed by increases in loan defaults and greater legal expenses, leading to higher foreclosed asset levels with an increased expense to maintain the properties, ending in a sale of the foreclosed assets - most likely at a loss.\nOur largest loan relationships currently make up a significant percentage of our total loan portfolio.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our 10 largest borrowing relationships totaled approximately $149 million in commitments (including unfunded commitments), or approximately 11 percent of our total loan portfolio. The concentration risk associated with having a small number of relatively large loan relationships is that, if one or more of these relationships were to become delinquent or suffer default, we could be at risk of material losses. The allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover losses associated with any of these relationships, and any loss or increase in the allowance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur corporate structure provides for decision-making authority by our regional presidents and banking teams. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be negatively affected if our employees do not follow our internal policies or are negligent in their decision-making.\nWe attract and retain our management talent by empowering them to make certain business decisions on a local level. Lending authorities are assigned to relationship managers, regional and presidents and regional credit officers to make credit decisions based on their experience. Additionally, all loans not in full compliance with the bank\u2019s loan policy must be approved by an additional level of authority with adequate credit authority for the exposure and any exposure in excess of $2.8 Million in Total Relationship Exposure with some sample loans below this amount are reviewed by our Chief Credit Officer in Knoxville, Tennessee. Moreover, for decisions that fall outside of the assigned individual authorities at every level, our teams are required to obtain approval from our. Officer Loan Committee and/or Directors Loan Committee. Our local bankers may not follow our internal procedures or otherwise act in our best interests with respect to their decision-making. A failure of our employees to follow our internal policies, or actions taken by our employees that are negligent could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nDeclines in the businesses or industries of our customers could cause increased credit losses and decreased loan balances, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe small to medium-sized businesses that we lend to may have fewer resources to weather adverse business developments, which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan, and such impairment could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A substantial focus of our marketing and business strategy is to serve small to medium-sized businesses in our market areas. As a result, a relatively high percentage of our loan portfolio consists of commercial loans to such businesses. We further anticipate an increase in the amount of loans to small to medium-sized businesses during 2018.\nSmall to medium-sized businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small and medium-sized business often depends on the management skills, talents and efforts of one or two people or a small group of people, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could have an adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay its loan. If general economic conditions negatively impact the markets in which we operate and small to medium-sized businesses are adversely affected or our borrowers are otherwise harmed by adverse business developments, this, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our deposits and other funding sources may be volatile and impact our liquidity.\nIn addition to the traditional core deposits, such as demand deposit accounts, interest checking, money market savings and certificates of deposits less than $250,000, we utilize or in the past have utilized several noncore funding sources, such as brokered certificates of deposit, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Cincinnati advances, federal funds purchased and other sources. We utilize these noncore funding sources to fund the ongoing operations and growth of SmartBank. The availability of these noncore funding sources is subject to broad economic conditions and to investor assessment of our financial strength and, as such, the cost of funds may fluctuate significantly and/or be restricted, thus impacting our net interest income, our immediate liquidity and/or our access to additional liquidity. We have somewhat similar risks to the extent high balance core deposits exceed the amount of deposit insurance coverage available.\nWe impose certain internal limits as to the absolute level of noncore funding we will incur at any point in time. Should we exceed those limitations, we may need to modify our growth plans, liquidate certain assets, participate loans to correspondents or execute other actions to allow for us to return to an acceptable level of noncore funding within a reasonable amount of time.\nWe face additional risks due to our increase in mortgage banking activities that have and could negatively impact our net income and profitability.\nWe have established mortgage banking operations which expose us to risks that are different from our retail and commercial banking operations. During higher and rising interest rate environments, the demand for mortgage loans and the level of refinancing activity tends to decline, which can lead to reduced volumes of business and lower revenues, which could negatively impact our earnings. While we have been experiencing historically low interest rates, the low interest rate environment likely will not continue indefinitely. Because we sell a substantial portion of the mortgage loans we originate, the profitability of our mortgage banking operations also depends in large part on our ability to aggregate a high volume of loans and sell them in the secondary market at a gain. Thus, in addition to our dependence on the interest rate environment, we are dependent upon (a) the existence of an active secondary market and (b) our ability to profitably sell loans into that market. Our mortgage banking operations incurred additional expenses over $2.1 million in 2017 and generated noninterest income of $1,058 thousand. Profitability of our mortgage operations will depend upon our ability to increase production and thus income while holding or reducing costs. In addition, mortgages sold to third-party investors are typically subject to certain repurchase provisions related to borrower refinancing, defaults, fraud or other reasons stipulated in the applicable third-party investor agreements. If the fair value of a loan when repurchased is less than the fair value when sold, we may be required to charge such shortfall to earnings.\nAny expansion into new lines of business might not be successful.\nAs part of our ongoing strategic plan, we will continue to consider expansion into new lines of business through the acquisition of third parties, or through organic growth and development. There are substantial risks associated with such efforts, including risks that (a) revenues from such activities might not be sufficient to offset the development, compliance, and other implementation costs, (b) competing products and services and shifting market preferences might affect the profitability of such activities, and (c) our internal controls might be inadequate to manage the risks associated with new activities. Furthermore, it is possible that our unfamiliarity with new lines of business might adversely affect the success of such actions. If any such expansions into new product markets are not successful, there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need additional access to capital, which we may be unable to obtain on attractive terms or at all.\nWe may need to incur additional debt or equity financing in the future to make strategic acquisitions or investments, for future growth or to fund losses or additional provision for loan losses in the future. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend in part on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we may be unable to raise additional capital, if and when needed, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired and our stock price negatively affected.\nAny deficiencies in our financial reporting or internal controls could materially and adversely affect us, including resulting in material misstatements in our financial statements, and could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, our operating results could be harmed and it could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in the future. Inferior controls and procedures or the identification of accounting errors could cause our investors to lose confidence in our internal controls and question our reported financial information, which, among other things, could have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, we could become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and a higher risk of shareholder litigation, which could result in significant additional expenses and require additional financial and management resources.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of being a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. We also incur costs associated with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and related rules implemented or to be implemented by the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock Market. In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to continue to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards and this continued investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected. In 2017 we incurred over $530 thousand in direct external costs associated with being a public company, which does not include the increased internal costs of the personnel needed to comply with being a public company.\nInability to retain senior management and key employees or to attract new experienced financial services professionals could impair our relationship with our customers, reduce growth and adversely affect our business.\nWe have assembled a senior management team which has substantial background and experience in banking and financial services. Moreover, much of our organic loan growth in 2012 through 2017 was the result of our ability to attract experienced financial services professionals who have been able to attract customers from other financial institutions. Inability to retain these key personnel or to continue to attract experienced lenders with established books of business could negatively impact our growth because of the loss of these individuals' skills and customer relationships and/or the potential difficulty of promptly replacing them.\nWe may be subject to losses due to fraudulent and negligent conduct of our loan customers, deposit customers, third party service providers and employees.\nWhen we make loans to individuals or entities, we rely upon information supplied by borrowers and other third parties, including information contained in the applicant\u2019s loan application, property appraisal reports, title information and the borrower\u2019s net worth, liquidity and cash flow information. While we attempt to verify information provided through available sources, we cannot be certain all such information is correct or complete. Our reliance on incorrect or incomplete information could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $50.8 million of goodwill and other intangible assets. A significant decline in our financial condition, a significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets. If we were to conclude that a future write-down of goodwill and other intangible assets is necessary, we would record the appropriate charge, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Future acquisitions could result in additional goodwill.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nOur ability to declare and pay dividends is limited.\nThere can be no assurance of whether or when we may pay dividends on our common stock in the future. Future dividends, if any, will be declared and paid at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors. Our principal source of funds used to pay cash dividends on our common stock will be dividends that we receive from SmartBank. Although the Bank\u2019s asset quality, earnings performance, liquidity and capital requirements will be taken into account before we declare or pay any future dividends on our common stock, our board of directors will also consider our liquidity and capital requirements and our board of directors could determine to declare and pay dividends without relying on dividend payments from the Bank.\nFederal and state banking laws and regulations and state corporate laws restrict the amount of dividends we may declare and pay. For example, Federal Reserve Board regulations implementing the capital rules required under Basel III do not permit dividends unless capital levels exceed certain higher levels applying capital conservation buffers that began to apply on January 1, 2016 and are being phased in over three years.\nFurther, in connection with the Capstone merger, we entered into a loan agreement for a revolving line of credit of up to $15 million. Under the terms of the loan agreement, we may not pay dividends on our common stock if we do not satisfy certain financial covenants and capital ratio requirements.\nEven though our common stock is currently traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market, it has less liquidity than many other stocks quoted on a national securities exchange.\nThe trading volume in our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market has been relatively low when compared with larger companies listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market or other stock exchanges. Although we have experienced increased liquidity in our stock, we cannot say with any certainty that a more active and liquid trading market for our common stock will continue to develop. Because of this, it may be more difficult for stockholders to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which stockholders could sell a smaller number of shares.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that future sales of our common stock in the market, or the availability of shares of common stock for sale in the market, will have on the market price of our common stock. We can give no assurance that sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the market, or the potential for large amounts of sales in the market, would not cause the price of our common stock to decline or impair our future ability to raise capital through sales of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly, and may fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance. General market or industry price declines or overall market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of our common stock, and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices.\nWe may issue additional shares of stock or equity derivative securities, including awards to current and future executive officers, directors and employees, which could result in the dilution of shareholders\u2019 investment.\nOur authorized capital includes 40,000,000 shares of common stock and 2,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2017, we had 11,152,561 shares of common stock and no shares of preferred stock outstanding, and had reserved or otherwise set aside for issuance 316,574 shares underlying outstanding options and 2,478,030 shares that are available for future grants of stock options, restricted stock or other equity-based awards pursuant to our equity incentive plans. Subject to NASDAQ rules, our board of directors generally has the authority to issue all or part of any authorized but unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock for any corporate purpose. We anticipate that we will issue additional equity in connection with the acquisition of other strategic partners and that in the future we likely will seek additional equity capital as we develop our business and expand our operations, depending on the timing and magnitude of any particular future acquisition. These issuances would dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders and may dilute the per share book value of the common stock. New investors also may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to, and that adversely affect, our then existing shareholders.\nIn addition, the issuance of shares under our equity compensation plans will result in dilution of our shareholders\u2019 ownership of our Common Stock. The exercise price of stock options could also adversely affect the terms on which we can obtain additional capital. Option holders are most likely to exercise their options when the exercise price is less than the market price for our Common Stock. They may profit from any increase in the stock price without assuming the risks of ownership of the underlying shares of Common Stock by exercising their options and selling the stock immediately.\nWe are subject to Tennessee\u2019s anti-takeover statutes and certain charter provisions that could decrease our chances of being acquired even if the acquisition is in the best interest of our shareholders.\nAs a Tennessee corporation, we are subject to various legislative acts that impose restrictions on and require compliance with procedures designed to protect shareholders against unfair or coercive mergers and acquisitions. These statutes may delay or prevent offers to acquire us and increase the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if the acquisition would be in our shareholders\u2019 best interests. Our charter also contains provisions which may make it difficult for another entity to acquire us without the approval of a majority of the disinterested directors on our board of directors. Secondly, the amount of common stock owned by, and other compensation arrangements with, certain of our officers and directors may make it more difficult to obtain shareholder approval of potential takeovers that they oppose. Agreements with our senior management also provide for significant payments under certain circumstances following a change in control. These compensation arrangements, together with the common stock and option ownership of our board of directors and management, could make it difficult or expensive to obtain majority support for shareholder proposals or potential acquisition proposals that the board of directors and officers oppose.", "PERMNO": 15906, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SMBK"}
