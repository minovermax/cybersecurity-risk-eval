These dealers, distributors and sales agents are often small businesses or sole proprietorships. Any restriction of, or disruption in, their ability to operate would adversely impact our business.\n\u2022\nApproximately 35% of our sales revenue depends on cross-border export of seed products from our primary production areas in the United States and Australia. Any disruption in cross-border shipments resulting, for example, from reduced capacity of the global shipping network or quarantine measures would adversely impact our business.\n\u2022\nApproximately 65% of our sales revenue is from dealers and distributors in the United States and Australia. Any disruption in shipments resulting, for example, from reduced capacity of the trucking and logistics network or quarantine measures would adversely impact our business.\n\u2022\nOur product revenue is predicated on our ability to timely fulfill customer orders, which depends in large part upon the consistent availability and operation of shipping and distribution networks operated by third parties. Farmers typically have a limited window during which they can plant seed, and their buying decisions can be shaped by actual or perceived disruptions in our distribution and supply channels. Any actual or perceived disruption in the distribution channel could alter customer buying decisions, prompting customers to delay or decrease their orders, which would negatively impact our sales revenue and could harm our reputation.\n\u2022\nA significant portion of our sales are made in markets in which sales are otherwise sensitive to changes in local currency to US Dollar exchange rates. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced increased foreign exchange rate volatility and currency devaluation in some of our markets outside the United States. Such volatility and disruption have impacted our customers and their ability to make timely payment on previously fulfilled orders. Any such effects on our customers\u2019 ability to pay would negatively impact our business and financial results.\n\u2022\nOur sales cycle is highly seasonal, and the majority of our sales season activities for the United States and Australia are typically concentrated between March and June of each calendar year. Our sales efforts have historically involved significant in-person interaction with potential customers and distributors. In March 2020, at the beginning of what is typically our most active selling period, many national, state and local governments in our target markets implemented various stay-at-home, shelter-in-place and other quarantine measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we immediately attempted to shift our sales activities to video conferencing and similar customer interaction models but have found these alternative approaches to generally be less effective than in-person sales efforts, and this could result in decreased sales revenue and a negative impact on our business and financial results.\n\u2022\nWe clean, process and package our seed products in multiple facilities in the United States and Australia. Any outbreak of COVID-19 at one of our facilities could require us to close the facility until the outbreak is resolved. Any such closure could have a negative impact on our ability to meet customer orders.\n\u2022\nWe offer our customers payment terms generally less than one year from invoicing in alignment with the growing season. As a result of the current economic downturn associated with the COVID-19 pandemic,\nour customers may be unable to repay their obligations to us when due, which could adversely affect our results and financial condition.\n\u2022\nWe have historically relied upon occasional sales of our debt and equity securities and borrowing under credit facilities from financial institutions, both in the United States and South Australia, to fund our operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption and volatility in equity and credit markets which could negatively impact our financing terms or impair our ability to access capital markets altogether, and could therefore negatively affect our liquidity.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to various affirmative and negative covenants in our loan agreements with our lenders. If the effects of COVID-19 cause us to fall out of compliance with one or more of such covenants and we are unable to secure a waiver or negotiate an amendment to such loan agreements on reasonable terms, or at all, an event of default could occur, which would allow our lenders to accelerate our repayment obligations or enforce their other rights under our agreements with them. Any such default may also require us to seek additional or alternative financing, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to access funds to repay our lenders, our lenders could take control of our pledged assets. Any of the foregoing events would negatively impact our financial condition and liquidity. For example, we were not in compliance with our fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under our CIBC facility as of June 30, 2020. On September 22, 2020, the CIBC loan agreement was amended and, among other things, CIBC waived the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant as of June 30, 2020 and suspended its applicability prospectively until the quarter ending March 31, 2021. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to comply with all of the covenants contained in the CIBC loan agreement in the future, or secure additional waivers if or when required.\n\u2022\nSince early March 2020, we have taken temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of COVID-19 to our employees and their families, including temporarily allowing office and sales employees to work remotely. We have suspended non-essential travel worldwide for our employees and prohibited employee attendance at in-person gatherings. Further measures may be taken as the COVID-19 outbreak continues. The measures taken now or in the future to contain the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively affect our ability to recruit and engage new employees and contractors necessary to the successful operation of our business.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which COVID-19 may impact our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions, stay-at-home or other similar orders and social distancing in the United States, Australia and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States, Australia and other countries to contain and treat the virus.\nOur earnings can be negatively impacted by declining demand brought on by varying factors, many of which are out of our control.\nDemand for our seed depends upon a variety of factors, including end demand for the crops grown from the seed. For example, a severe downturn in the dairy industry could have a negative effect on sales of alfalfa hay, and as a result, the demand for our alfalfa seed in the U.S. market. In addition, demand for our products could decline because of other supply and quality issues or for any other reason, including products of competitors that might be considered superior by end users. A decline in demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur earnings may also be sensitive to fluctuations in market prices for seed.\nMarket prices for our seed can be impacted by factors such as the quality of the seed and the available supply, including whether lower-quality, lower-priced seed is available. Growing conditions, particularly weather conditions such as windstorms, floods, droughts and freezes, as well as diseases and pests and the adventitious presence of GMO, are primary factors influencing the quality and quantity of the seed and, therefore, the market price at which we can sell our seed to our customers. A decrease in the prices received for our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur earnings are vulnerable to cost increases.\nFuture increase in costs, such as the costs of growing seed, could cause our margins and earnings to decline unless we are able to pass along the increased price of production to our customers. We may not be able to increase the price of our seed sufficiently to maintain our margins and earnings in the future.\nOur inventory of seed can be adversely affected by the market price being paid for other crops.\nOur seed production relies entirely on unaffiliated growers to grow our proprietary seed and to sell it to us at negotiated prices each year. Growers have a choice of what crops to plant. If a particular crop is paying a materially higher price than has been paid in the past, growers may decide to not grow our seed crops in favor of receiving a higher return from an alternative crop planted on the same acreage. If our growers decline to a significant degree to plant the acreage on which we rely, and if we cannot find other growers to plant the lost acreage, our inventory of seed could be insufficient to satisfy the needs of our customers unless we are able to procure the necessary additional seed in the market at prices we cannot control. If these circumstances occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could materially decline. In addition, our customers could look to other suppliers for their seed if we cannot satisfy their requirements, and we may not be able to regain them as customers once our inventory levels have returned to normal.\nAdverse weather conditions, natural disasters, crop disease, pests and other natural conditions can impose significant costs and losses on our business.\nOur seed crops are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, including windstorms, floods, drought and temperature extremes, which are common but difficult to predict. In addition, seed crops are vulnerable to crop disease and to pests, which may vary in severity and effect, depending on the stage of production at the time of infection or infestation, the type of treatment applied and climatic conditions. Unfavorable growing conditions can reduce both crop size and quality. Although we no longer grow any of our seed directly, these factors can still impact us by potentially decreasing the quality and yields of our seed and reducing our available inventory. These factors can increase costs, decrease revenue and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBecause our seed business is highly seasonal, our revenue, cash flows from operations and operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis.\nOur seed business is seasonal. The seasonal nature of our operations results in significant fluctuations in our working capital during the growing and selling cycles. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant variability in net sales, operating cash flows and net income (loss) on a quarterly basis.\nWe have had a material concentration of revenue from a small group of customers that fluctuates, and the loss of any of these customers in any quarter could have a material adverse effect on our revenue.\nOn a historical basis, we have experienced a material concentration of revenue from a small group of customers. This concentration fluctuates from quarter to quarter, depending on our customer's specific requirements, which are themselves cyclical. However, in any particular quarter, we generally have a small group of customers that accounts for a substantial portion of that quarter\u2019s revenue. Most of these customers are not contractually obligated to purchase seed from us. The loss of one or more of these customers on a quarterly basis, when taken year over year, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations and operating cash flows. We could also suffer a material adverse effect from any losses arising from a major customer's disputes regarding shipments, product quality or related matters, or from our inability to collect accounts receivable from any major customer. There are no assurances that we will be able to maintain our current customer relationships or that they will continue to purchase our seed in the current projected quantities. Any failure to do so may materially adversely impact our business.\nBecause we depend on a core group of significant customers, our sales, cash flows from operations and results of operations may be negatively affected if our key customers reduce the amount of products they purchase from us.\nAlthough our customer concentration should decline as our product mix becomes more diverse, there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain the relationships with our major customers or that they will continue to purchase our seed in the quantities that we expect and rely upon. If we cannot do so, our results of operations could suffer.\nBecause we do not grow the seed that we sell, we are completely dependent on our network of contract growers, and our sales, cash flows from operations and results of operations may be negatively affected if we are unable to maintain an adequate network of contract growers to supply our seed requirements.\nWe do not directly grow any of the seed that we sell, and therefore, we are entirely dependent upon our network of growers. While we have some supply contracts with our growers of up to seven years in duration, many of our grower contracts cover only one year, which makes us particularly vulnerable to factors beyond our control. Events such as a shift in pricing caused by an increase in the value of commodity crops other than seed crops, increase in land prices, unexpected competition or reduced water availability could disrupt our supply chain. Any of these disruptions could limit the supply of seed that we obtain in any given year, adversely affecting supply and thereby lowering revenue. Such disruption could also damage our customer relationships and loyalty to us if we cannot supply the quantity of seed expected by them.\nOur ability to contract for sufficient acreage presents challenges.\nIn order to increase revenue and earnings, we continue to need more production acreage. As we continue to increase the number of acres under contract and/or to move production into new geographical locations, we face challenges that can impede our ability to produce as much seed inventory as we have budgeted. For example, when we move production into new geographical locations, we may find it difficult to identify growers with the expertise to grow our seed crops, and we may not have sufficient company personnel available in such new locations to provide production advice on a timely basis. We also face increased competition for conventional seed acreage as the need for technology acres grows, which is further complicated by the field isolation issue relating to GMO crops that can reduce the amount of acreage available for conventional alfalfa seed crops. If we are unable to secure the acreage we need to meet our planned production for the crop year and are unable to purchase seed in the market, our results of operations could suffer, as would our reputation.\nA lack of availability of water in any of our production areas could impact our business.\nAdequate quantities and correct timing of the application of water are vital for most agriculture to thrive. Whether particular farms are experiencing water shortages depends, in large part, on their location. However, continuing drought conditions can threaten all farmland other than those properties with their own water sources. Foreign or domestic regulations regarding water usage and rights may also limit the availability of water. Although our current seed products are not water-intensive crops, the availability or the cost of water is a factor in the planting of the crops grown from our seed. Moreover, if the farmers and others who purchase our seed to grow crops cannot get an adequate supply of water, or if the cost of water makes it uneconomical for the farmers to grow the crops, we may not be able to sell our seed, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe face intense competition, and our inability to compete effectively for any reason could adversely affect our business.\nCompetition in the seed industry both domestically and internationally is intense, and we believe it is intensifying with industry consolidation. We face direct competition from other seed companies, including multinational agriculture companies, regional seed companies and small family-owned businesses, as well as subsidiaries or other affiliates of chemical, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do.\nThese resources give our competitors greater operating flexibility that, in certain cases, may permit them to respond better or more quickly to changes in the industry or to introduce new products more quickly and with greater marketing support. Increased competition could result in lower profit margins, substantial pricing pressure, reduced\nmarket share and lower operating cash flows. Price competition, together with other forms of competition, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and operating cash flows.\nIf we are unable to estimate our customers\u2019 future needs accurately and to match our production to the demand of our customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe sell our seed primarily to dealers and distributors who, in turn, sell primarily to farmers who grow crops from the seed. Due to the nature of the seed industry, we normally produce seed according to our production plan before we sell and deliver seed to distributors and dealers. Our dealers and distributors generally make purchasing decisions for our products based on market prices, economic and weather conditions and other factors that we and our dealers and distributors may not be able to anticipate accurately in advance. If we fail to accurately estimate the volume and types of products sought by the end users and otherwise adequately manage production amounts, we may produce more seed than our dealers and distributors want, resulting in excess inventory levels. It may be difficult for us to dispose of all of our inventory on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and we may need to record an impairment charge for a portion of this inventory in subsequent fiscal periods. Any such impairment charge or any failure to sell inventory on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and operating cash flows.\nOn the other hand, if we underestimate demand, we may not be able to satisfy our dealers and distributors' demand for seed, and thus damage our customer relations and end-user loyalty. Our failure to estimate end users\u2019 future needs and to match our production to the demand of our customers may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur third-party distributors may not effectively distribute our products.\nWe depend in part on third-party distributors and strategic relationships for the marketing and selling of our products. We depend on these distributors\u2019 efforts to market our products, yet we are unable to control their efforts completely. In addition, we are unable to ensure that our distributors comply with all applicable laws regarding the sale of our products, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended. If our distributors fail to effectively market and sell our products, and in full compliance with applicable laws, our operating results and business may suffer.\nWe extend credit to our largest international customer and to certain of our other international customers, which exposes us to the difficulties of collecting our receivables in foreign jurisdictions if those customers fail to pay us.\nAlthough payment terms for our export seed sales range from prepayment to 90 to 120 days, we extend credit to our largest international customer, Sorouh, and to other international customers up to 180 days. Sales of our seed to Sorouh and to other international customers represented a material portion of our revenue in historical periods and we expect that we will continue to extend credit in connection with future sales. Because these customers are located in foreign countries, collection efforts, were they to become necessary, could be much more difficult and expensive than pursuing similar claims in the United States. Moreover, future political and/or economic factors, as well as future unanticipated trade regulations, could negatively impact our ability to timely collect outstanding receivables from these important customers. The extension of credit to our international customers exposes us to the risk that our seed will be delivered but that we may not receive all or a portion of the payment therefor. If these customers are unable or unwilling to fully pay for the seed they purchase on credit, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially negatively impacted. Moreover, our internal forecasts on which we make business decisions throughout the year could be severely compromised, which could, in turn, mean that we spend capital for operations, investment or otherwise that we would not have spent had we been aware that the customer would not honor its credit extension obligation.\nOur current reliance on the seed development and production business does not permit us to spread our business risks among different business segments, and thus a disruption in our seed production or the industry would harm us more immediately and directly than if we were more diversified.\nWe currently operate primarily in the agricultural seed business, and we do not expect this to change materially in the foreseeable future. Without business line diversity, we will not be able to spread the risk of our operations. Therefore, our business opportunities, revenue and income could be more immediately and directly affected by disruptions from such things as drought and disease or widespread problems affecting the alfalfa, sorghum, sunflower and pasture seed markets, payment disruptions and customer rejection of our seed. If there is a disruption as described above, our revenue and earnings could be reduced, and our business operations might have to be scaled back.\nIf we fail to introduce and commercialize new seed products, we may not be able to maintain market share, and our future sales may be harmed.\nThe performance of our new seed products may not meet our customers\u2019 expectations, or we may not be able to introduce and commercialize specific seed varieties and hybrids. Reorder rates are uncertain due to several factors, many of which are beyond our control. These include changing customer preferences, which could be further complicated by competitive price pressures, our failure to develop new products to meet the evolving demands of the end users, the development of higher-demand products by our competitors and general economic conditions. The process for new products to gain market recognition and acceptance is long and has uncertainties. If we fail to introduce and commercialize a new seed product that meets the demand of the end user, if our competitors develop products that are favored by the end users, or if we are unable to produce our existing products in sufficient quantities, our growth prospects may be materially and adversely affected, and our revenue may decline. In addition, sales of our new products could replace sales of some of our current similar products, offsetting the benefit of a successful product introduction.\nThe presence of GMO alfalfa in Australia or California could impact our sales.\nGMO crops currently are prohibited in most of the international markets in which our proprietary seed is currently sold. There are regions in the United States, including the Pacific Northwest, where even small quantities of GMO material inadvertently interspersed with conventional (non-GMO) alfalfa seed make the seed undesirable, which causes customers to look elsewhere for their alfalfa seed requirements. The greater the use of GMO seed in California and other alfalfa seed growing regions, the greater the risk that the adventitious presence of GMO material in our seed production will occur due to pollination from hay fields or other seed fields. We regularly test for the adventitious presence of GMO in our conventional alfalfa seed, and we have seen a slight increase in the percentage of GMO presence in conventional alfalfa seed over the past several years. Our seed containing GMO material can only be sold domestically or in other jurisdictions that permit the importation of GMO alfalfa. If we are unable to isolate our conventional alfalfa seed from inadvertently being contaminated by GMO seed, we may find it more difficult to sell that seed in our key markets and we may have insufficient quantities of seed to sell internationally, either of which could materially adversely impact our revenue over time.\nThe stevia market may not develop as we anticipate, and therefore our continued research and development activities with respect to stevia may never become profitable to us.\nThere are a number of challenges to market acceptance of stevia as a natural, non-caloric sweetener. Stevia has its own unique flavor, which can affect the taste of some foods and beverages. A common complaint about stevia is that some of its extracts and derivatives have a bitter aftertaste, and its taste does not uniformly correspond to all regional taste preferences or combine well with some food flavors. Other factors that could impact market acceptance include the price structure compared to other sugar substitutes and availability. If the high-intensity, non-caloric sweetener market declines or if stevia fails to achieve substantially greater market acceptance than it currently enjoys, we might never be able to profit from our continued research and development activities relating to stevia or any commercial applications that we derive therefrom. Even if products conform to applicable safety and quality standards, sales could be adversely affected if consumers in target markets lose confidence in the safety, efficacy and quality of stevia. Adverse publicity about stevia or stevia-based products may discourage consumers from buying products that contain stevia. Any of these developments could adversely impact the future amount of dry leaf stevia, processed stevia leaves or extract we are able to sell, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nThe loss of key employees or the failure to attract qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to run our business.\nThe loss of any of our current executives, key employees or key advisors, or the failure to attract, integrate, motivate and retain additional key employees, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Although we have employment agreements with our executive officers, as well as certain other employees, all of our employees are employed \u201cat-will\u201d and could leave our employ at any time. We do not carry \u201ckey person\u201d insurance on the lives of any of our management team. As we develop additional capabilities, we may require more skilled personnel who must be highly skilled and have a sound understanding of our industry, business or processing requirements. Recruiting skilled personnel is highly competitive. Although to date we have been successful in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, there can be no assurance that we will continue to attract and retain the personnel needed for our business. The failure to attract or retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to manage expansion of our operations effectively.\nWe expect our operations to continue to grow in the future, both as we expand our historical alfalfa seed business both domestically and internationally through internal growth and synergistic acquisitions and increase our growers\u2019 production. These efforts will require the addition of employees, expansion of facilities and greater oversight, perhaps in diverse locations. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, execute on our business strategies or respond to competitive pressures, and we may have difficulties maintaining and updating the internal procedures and the controls necessary to meet the planned expansion of our overall business.\nOur management will also be required to maintain and expand our relationships with customers, suppliers and other third parties as well as attract new customers and suppliers. We expect that our sales and marketing costs will increase as we grow our product lines and as we increase our sales efforts in new and existing markets. Our current and planned operations, personnel, systems and internal procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future growth.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate the businesses we have recently acquired and may acquire in the future with our current management and structure.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we have acquired and may continue to acquire additional businesses, product lines or other assets. We may not be able to locate or make suitable acquisitions on acceptable terms, and future acquisitions may not be effectively and profitably integrated into our business. Our failure to successfully complete the integration of the businesses we acquire could have an adverse effect on our prospects, business activities, cash flow, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. Integration challenges may include the following:\n\u2022\nassimilating the acquired operations, products and personnel with our existing operations, products and personnel;\n\u2022\nestimating the capital, personnel and equipment required for the acquired businesses based on the historical experience of management with the businesses with which they are familiar;\n\u2022\nminimizing potential adverse effects on existing business relationships with other suppliers and customers;\n\u2022\ndeveloping and marketing the new products and services;\n\u2022\nentering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience; and\n\u2022\ncoordinating our efforts throughout various distant localities and time zones.\nIn connection with any such transactions, we may also issue equity securities, incur additional debt, assume contractual obligations or liabilities or expend significant cash. Such transactions could harm our operating results and cash position and negatively affect the price of our stock.\nFor example, on February 24, 2020, we completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Pasture Genetics. We cannot guarantee that the Pasture Genetics acquisition will yield the results we have anticipated. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will achieve the revenues, growth prospects and synergies expected from this acquisition, our prior acquisitions or any future acquisitions, or that we will achieve such revenue, growth prospects and synergies in a manner consistent with our expectations. Our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe diversion of management's attention and costs associated with acquisitions may have a negative impact on our business.\nIf management\u2019s attention is diverted from the management of our existing businesses as a result of its efforts in evaluating and negotiating new acquisitions and strategic transactions, the prospects, business activities, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations of our existing businesses may suffer. We also may incur unanticipated costs in connection with pursuing acquisitions and strategic transactions, whether they ultimately are consummated or not.\nS&W Australia's alfalfa seed grower pool is dependent on a limited number of milling facilities to process its seed, with particular dependence on a dominant operator whose commercial interests may be adverse to S&W Australia.\nOnly five milling facilities are regularly used by S&W Australia\u2019s grower pool to clean and process S&W Australia alfalfa seed. Should one or more of these facilities become unusable, there could be a significant effect on S&W Australia\u2019s ability to get its Australian alfalfa seed to market in a timely manner or at all. S&W Australia\u2019s growers use Tatiara to process approximately 70% of the seed grown for S&W Australia. The owner of Tatiara has begun to sell his own common seed and is now both a supplier and competitor of S&W Australia. This competing seed business creates a potential conflict of interest for Tatiara in the care and handling of S&W Australia\u2019s product and could impact S&W Australia\u2019s ability to have seed available to sell on the time schedule required by our customers.\nS&W Australia is thinly capitalized and may become dependent upon us for financing.\nBecause S&W Australia has relatively little net working capital, it is substantially dependent upon its credit arrangement with National Australia Bank Ltd, or NAB, to purchase its seed inventory. If S&W Australia breaches its credit arrangement in the future or other reasons cause this credit arrangement to become unavailable to S&W Australia, S&W Australia may become reliant on us to finance its operations or for financial guarantees. We currently are a guarantor on S&W Australia's NAB credit facility. S&W Australia's financial dependency upon us could have a negative adverse effect upon our financial condition.\nS&W Australia is dependent on a pool of seed growers and a favorable pricing model for alfalfa seed production.\nS&W Australia relies on a pool of approximately 100 Australian contract growers to produce its proprietary alfalfa seeds. In this system, growers contract with S&W Australia to grow S&W Australia\u2019s seed for terms of seven to ten years in the case of alfalfa and two to three years for white clover. S&W Australia uses a staggered payment system with the growers of its alfalfa and white clover; the payment amounts are based upon an estimated budget price, or EBP, for compliant seed. EBP is a forecast of the final price that S&W Australia believes will be achieved taking into account prevailing and predicted market conditions at the time the estimate is made. Following the grower\u2019s delivery of uncleaned seed to a milling facility, S&W Australia typically pays 40% of the EBP to the grower based on pre-cleaning weight. Following this initial payment and prior to the final payment, S&W Australia makes a series of scheduled progress payments and, if applicable, a bonus payment for \u201cfirst grade\u201d alfalfa seed. The final price payable to each grower (and therefore the total price) is dependent upon and subject to adjustment based upon the clean weight of the seed grown, on the average price at which S&W Australia sells the pooled seed and other costs incurred by S&W Australia. Accordingly, the total price paid by S&W Australia to its growers may be more or less than the EBP. This arrangement exposes S&W Australia\u2019s business to unique risks, including, the potential for current growers to make collective demands that are unfavorable to S&W Australia and the potential for our competitors to offer more favorable terms for seed production, including fixed (instead of variable) payment terms.\nS&W Australia\u2019s reliance upon an estimated purchase price to growers could result in changes in estimates in our consolidated financial statements.\nS&W Australia does not fix the final price for alfalfa and clover seed payable to its growers until the completion of a given year\u2019s sales cycle, pursuant to the standard contract production agreement. We record an estimated unit price, and accordingly, inventory, cost of goods sold and gross profits are based upon management\u2019s best estimate of the final purchase price to our S&W Australia growers. To the extent the estimated purchase price varies from the final purchase price for seed, the adjustment to actual could materially impact the results in the period when the difference between estimates and actuals are identified. If the actual purchase price is in excess of our estimated purchase price, this would negatively impact our financial results, including a reduction in gross profits and net income.\nChanges in government policies and laws could adversely affect international sales and therefore our financial results.\nHistorically, sales to our distributors who sell our proprietary alfalfa seed varieties outside the United States have constituted a meaningful portion of our annual revenue. We anticipate that sales into international markets will continue to represent a meaningful portion of our total sales and that continued growth and profitability will require further international expansion, particularly in the Middle East and Africa. Our financial results could be affected by changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies, laws and regulations, or other activities of U.S. and non-U.S. governments, agencies and similar organizations. These conditions include but are not limited to changes in a country\u2019s or region\u2019s economic or political conditions, trade regulations affecting production, pricing and marketing of products, local labor conditions and regulations, reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries, changes in the regulatory or legal environment, burdensome taxes and tariffs and other trade barriers. International risks and uncertainties, including changing social and economic conditions as well as terrorism, political hostilities and war, could lead to reduced distribution of our products into international markets and reduced profitability associated with such sales.\nWe are subject to risks associated with doing business globally.\nOur operations, both inside and outside the United States, are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies. Although we sell seed to various regions of the world, a significant percentage of our sales outside the United States in fiscal year 2020 were principally to customers in the Middle East, Australia, North Africa and Mexico. Accordingly, developments in those parts of the world generally have a more significant effect on our operations than developments in other places. Our operations outside the United States are subject to special risks and restrictions, including, without limitation: fluctuations in currency values and foreign-currency exchange rates; exchange control regulations; changes in local political or economic conditions; governmental pricing directives; import and trade restrictions; import or export licensing requirements and trade policy; restrictions on the ability to repatriate funds; and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting U.S. companies doing business abroad, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Acts of terror or war may impair our ability to operate in particular countries or regions, and may impede the flow of goods and services between countries. Customers in weakened economies may be unable to purchase our products, or it could become more expensive for them to purchase imported products in their local currency, or sell their commodity at prevailing international prices, and we may be unable to collect receivables from such customers. Further, changes in exchange rates may affect our net earnings, the book value of our assets outside the United States and our stockholders\u2019 equity. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or similar laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits United States companies, including their suppliers, distributors and other commercial partners, from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Corruption, extortion, bribery, pay-offs, theft and other fraudulent practices occur from time-to-time in the countries in which we distribute products. We have adopted formal policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws. If our employees or other agents, including our distributors or suppliers, are found to have engaged in such practices, we could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental regulation affecting our seed products could negatively impact our business.\nOur agricultural operations are subject to a broad range of evolving environmental laws and regulations applicable to the markets in which we operate. These environmental laws and regulations are intended to address concerns related to, among other things, air quality, storm water discharge and management and disposal of agricultural chemicals relating to seed treatment.\nIn the U.S., we are subject to evolving environmental laws and regulations by federal and state governments. Federal laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Federal Seed Act, and potentially regulations of the FDA and/or other State regulatory agencies.\nOur Australian operations are also subject to a number of environmental laws, regulations and policies, including in particular the Environment Protection Act 1993 (SA), the Agricultural and Veterinary Products (Control of Use) Act 2002 (SA), the Genetically Modified Crops Management Act 2004 (SA), the Dangerous Substances Act 1979 (SA), the Controlled Substances Act 1984 (SA) and related regulations and policies.\nOur failure to comply with these laws and related regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, it is possible that future developments, such as increasingly strict environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder, and further restrictions on the use of agricultural chemicals, could result in increased compliance costs which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to obtain government approvals for certain of our products, we may be unable to commercialize those products in certain markets.\nOur ability to launch and commercialize certain new products is subject to regulatory approval, which can be lengthy, costly, complex and in some markets unpredictable. For example, the timing of our anticipated launch of sorghum hybrids developed through our DoubleTeamTM collaboration with ADAMA will depend on our receipt of regulatory approval. Seed products incorporating biotechnology derived traits and crop protection products must be extensively tested for safety, efficacy and environmental impact before they can be registered for production, use, sale or commercialization in a given market. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals requires submitting a significant amount of information and data, which may require participation from technology providers. If we are unable to receive the necessary approvals, we will be unable to produce and sell certain of our current and future products, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnauthorized access to our information technology systems, infrastructure and data could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon our own and third-party information technology systems, infrastructure and data, including mobile technologies, to operate our business. The multitude and complexity of our computer systems may make them vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, disruption of data integrity, malicious intrusion, or random attacks. Likewise, data privacy or security incidents or breaches by employees or others may pose a risk that sensitive data, including our intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information of our employees, customers or other business partners may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Our business partners face similar risks and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture.\nIn addition, cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of-service, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information, trade secrets or other intellectual property.\nA security breach, including, for example, a misappropriation of customer, distributor or employee confidential information, trade secrets or intellectual property, could disrupt our business and result in increased costs or loss of revenue, which may include potential costs of investigations, legal, forensic and consulting fees and expenses, costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention required for investigation, remediation and litigation, substantial repair or replacement costs. In addition, any disruption in our information technology systems, loss of data or other disruptions could impair our ability to manage inventories, process transactions and communicate with our customers, which could prevent us from being able to fulfill orders, result in cancelations and loss of customers, cause us reputational harm and generally disrupt our ability to conduct our business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWhile we have implemented measures for the protection of our data and information technology infrastructure, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions, or identify breaches in our systems, that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us. In addition, our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches.\nInsurance covering defective seed claims may become unavailable or be inadequate.\nDefective seed could result in insurance claims and negative publicity. Although we carry general liability insurance to cover defective seed claims, such coverage may become unavailable or be inadequate. Even if coverage is offered, it may be at a price and on terms not acceptable to us. If claims exceed coverage limits, or if insurance is not available to us, the occurrence of significant claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may be exposed to product quality claims, which may cause us to incur substantial legal expenses and, if determined adversely against us, may cause us to pay significant damage awards.\nWe may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to our seed or stevia quality. The defense of these proceedings and claims can be both costly and time consuming and may significantly divert efforts and resources of our management personnel. An adverse determination in any such proceeding could subject us to significant liability and damage our market reputation and prevent us from achieving increased sales and market share. Protracted litigation could also result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase of our products.\nCapital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our growers and customers.\nThe capital and credit markets have experienced increased volatility and disruption over the past several years, making it more difficult for companies to access those markets. Although we believe that our operating cash flows, historical access to the capital market and our lines of credit will permit us to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future, continued or increased volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets may impair our liquidity or increase our costs of borrowing, if we need to access the credit market. Our business could also be negatively impacted if our growers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our business and prospects may be harmed.\nOur ability to compete effectively is dependent upon the proprietary nature of the seeds, seedlings, processes, technologies and materials owned by or used by us or our growers. If any competitors independently develop new traits, seeds, seedlings, processes or technologies that customers or end users determine are better than our existing products, such developments could adversely affect our competitive position.\nIn some cases, we obtain patent protection or plant breeder rights registrations for certain of our seed products. However, our principal method of guarding our proprietary varieties and hybrids is exercising a high degree of control over the supply chain. We also rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect proprietary know-how that is not patentable, processes for which patents are difficult to enforce and any other elements of our discovery and development processes that involve proprietary know-how, information or technology that is not covered by patents. Although we require our employees, consultants, advisors and any third parties who have access to our proprietary know-how, information, or technology to enter into confidentiality agreements, we cannot be certain that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques.\nEven with these measures in place, it would be possible for persons with access to our seed or plants grown from our seed to reproduce and market products substantially similar to our proprietary seed varieties, which could significantly harm our business and our reputation. Third parties may challenge the validity, enforceability and scope of our intellectual property rights. Furthermore, we sell our products in more than 30 countries and the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. Litigation may be necessary to protect our proprietary property and determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of competitors. Intellectual property litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management and other resources. If we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights, our competitors could market products that compete with our proprietary products without obtaining a license from us.\nRisks Related to our Financial Position and Investment in Our Securities\nThe terms of our loan and security agreement with CIBC place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility, and failure to comply with covenants or to satisfy certain conditions may result in acceleration of our repayment obligations and foreclosure on our pledged assets, which could significantly harm our liquidity, financial condition, operating results, business and prospects and cause the price of our securities to decline.\nOur $25.0 million revolving credit facility with CIBC Bank USA, or CIBC, is secured by a first priority perfected security interest in substantially all of our assets, subject to certain exceptions.\nOur loan agreement with CIBC requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, including a specified fixed charge ratio tested quarterly. The loan agreement also requires us to comply with a number of other covenants (affirmative and negative), including restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness; merge or consolidate with or into any other organization or otherwise suffer a change in control; acquire, own or make investments; repurchase or redeem any class of stock or other equity interest; declare or pay any cash dividend or make a cash distribution on any class of stock or other equity interest; and transfer a material portion of our assets, in each case subject to exceptions.\nIn addition to other specified events of default, and subject to limited exceptions, CIBC could declare an event of default upon our non-compliance with certain covenants or the occurrence of certain events that it may determine, in its sole discretion, to have a material adverse effect, including: a material adverse change in, or a material adverse effect on our business, property, assets or operations, taken as a whole; a material impairment of our ability to perform any of our obligations under the loan agreement; a material adverse effect upon the collateral for the loan or its value; or a material impairment of the enforceability or priority of the liens upon the collateral for the loan or the legality, validity, binding effect or enforceability of the loan agreement or related agreements.\nIf we default under the credit facility, CIBC may accelerate all of our repayment obligations, which may require us to seek additional or alternate financing and/or modify our operational plans. For example, we were not in compliance with our fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under our CIBC facility as of June 30, 2020. On September 22, 2020, the CIBC loan agreement was amended and, among other things, CIBC waived the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant as of June 30, 2020 and suspended its applicability prospectively until the quarter ending March 31, 2021. Commencing with the quarter ending September 30, 2020, through and including December 31, 2020, the amendment provides that we must comply with a financial covenant requiring us to maintain year-to-date EBITDA (as calculated in the Loan Agreement) of no less than negative $6,000,000, tested quarterly. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to comply with all of the covenants contained in the CIBC loan agreement in the future, or secure additional waivers if or when required. If we are unable to comply with or obtain a waiver of any noncompliance under the loan agreement, CIBC could declare an event of default or require us to further renegotiate the loan agreement on terms that may be significantly less favorable to us, or we may be required to seek additional or alternative financing. If we were to seek additional or alternative financing, any such financing may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to access funds to meet those obligations or to renegotiate our agreement, CIBC could foreclose on our pledged assets and we would have to immediately cease operations. In addition, during the continuance of an event of default, the then-applicable interest rate on the then-outstanding principal balance is subject to increase. Upon an event of default, CIBC could also require us to repay the loan immediately, together with a prepayment penalty, and other fees. If we were to renegotiate the agreement under such circumstances, the terms may be significantly less favorable to us. If we were liquidated, CIBC\u2019s right to repayment would be senior to the rights of our stockholders to receive any proceeds from the liquidation. Any declaration by CIBC of an event of default could significantly harm our liquidity, financial condition, operating results, business, and prospects and cause the price of our securities to decline.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness in the future. The debt instruments governing such indebtedness may contain provisions that are as, or more, restrictive than the provisions governing our existing indebtedness. If we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness when payment is due, CIBC could proceed against the collateral or force us into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe received a loan under the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act and our receipt of this loan may result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation or potential penalties.\nWe have received loan proceeds pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program under the CARES Act. The lack of clarity regarding loan eligibility under the Paycheck Protection Program has resulted in significant media coverage and controversy with respect to public companies applying for and receiving loans. If, despite our good-faith belief that we satisfied all eligible requirements for the loan, we are later determined to be in violation of any of the laws or governmental regulations that apply to us in connection with the loan, such as the False Claims Act, or it is otherwise determined that we were ineligible to receive the loan, we may be subject to penalties, including significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties and could be required to repay the loan in its entirety. In addition, we could become subject to adverse publicity, review or audit by the SBA or other government entity or claims under the False Claims Act and could consume significant financial and management resources. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future.\nFrom time to time, we may find it necessary or advisable to raise additional capital in the future, whether to enhance our working capital, to repay indebtedness, to fund acquisitions or for other reasons. This may include, for example, the need to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity and debt financings, as well as potentially entering into collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. If we are required or desire to raise additional capital in the future, such additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, or available at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest could be diluted and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends and may be secured by all or a portion of our assets. If we fail to obtain additional capital as and when required, such failure could have a material impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe value of our common stock can be volatile.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The overall market and the price of our common stock can fluctuate greatly. The trading price of our common stock may be significantly affected by various factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\neconomic status and trends in the dairy industry, which underlies demand for our alfalfa seed;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions for alfalfa seed in the Middle East and North Africa, where a substantial amount of our seed historically has been purchased by end users;\n\u2022\nquarterly fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nour ability to meet the earnings estimates and other performance expectations of investors or financial analysts;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the stock prices of our peer companies or in stock markets in general; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic or political conditions.\nOur quarter-to-quarter performance may vary substantially, and this variance, as well as general market conditions, may cause the price of our securities to fluctuate greatly and potentially expose us to litigation.\nOur seed business is highly seasonal because it is tied to the growing and harvesting seasons. If sales in particular quarters are lower than expected, our operating results for these quarters could cause our share price to decline.\nOur future expense estimates are based, in large part, on estimates of future revenue, which is difficult to predict. We expect to continue to make significant expenditures in order to expand production, sales, marketing and processes. We may be unable to, or may elect not to, adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected\nrevenue shortfall. If our increased expenses are not accompanied by increased revenue in the same quarter, our quarterly operating results would be harmed.\nIn one or more future quarters, our results of operations may fall below the expectations of investors or analysts, and the trading price of our securities may decline as a consequence. We believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results will not be a good indication of our future performance and should not be relied upon to predict the future performance of our stock price.\nIn the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have often been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nIf we issue shares of preferred stock, the holdings of those owning our common stock could be diluted or subordinated to the rights of the holders of preferred stock.\nOur board of directors is authorized by our articles of incorporation to establish classes or series of preferred stock and fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such class or series without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Any shares of preferred stock so issued could have priority over our common stock with respect to dividend or liquidation rights.\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\nWe routinely release annual guidance in our quarterly earnings releases, our quarterly earnings conference calls and in other forums we consider appropriate. Such guidance regarding our future performance represents our management's estimates as of the date of release or other communication. This guidance, which includes forward-looking statements, is based on projections prepared by our management. These projections are not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our independent registered public accountants nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the projections, and accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.\nProjections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. If we issue guidance, we will generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges or approximations that are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges or approximations. The principal reason that we would release guidance would be to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance, when given, is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release or other communication. Actual results will vary from our guidance, and the variations may be material. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged not to rely upon, or otherwise consider, our guidance in making an investment decision about our securities.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not plan to pay any cash dividends in the near future. Our current policy is to retain all funds and any earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. If we do not pay cash dividends, our stock may be less valuable to investors because a return on their investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\nAnti-takeover provisions and our right to issue preferred stock could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that would make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, including a provision that our board of directors may issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. In addition, certain anti-takeover provisions of Nevada law, if and when applicable, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 93434, "SIC": 100, "TIC": "SANW"}
