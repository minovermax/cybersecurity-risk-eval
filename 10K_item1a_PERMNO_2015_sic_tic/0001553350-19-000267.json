{"cik": "1476963", "company": "HEAT BIOLOGICS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nInvestors should carefully consider the risks described below before deciding whether to invest in our securities. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements made throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K as a result of different factors, including the risks we face described below.\nRisks Relating to our Company\nWe have had limited operations to date.\nWe are a clinical stage company and have had limited operations to date as has our subsidiary, Pelican. We have yet to demonstrate our ability to overcome the risks frequently encountered in our industry and are still subject to many of the risks common to such enterprises, including our ability to implement our business plan, market acceptance of our proposed business and products, under-capitalization, cash shortages, limitations with respect to personnel, financing and other resources, competition from better funded and experienced companies, and uncertainty of our ability to generate revenues. There is no assurance that our activities will be successful or will result in any revenues or profit, and the likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the stage of our development. To date, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and our only revenue to date has been grant revenue that Pelican has received from CPRIT and a small amount of revenue from a research funding agreement. Even if we generate revenue from product sales, which is not anticipated for several years, if at all, there can be no assurance that we will be profitable. In addition, no assurance can be given that we will be able to consummate our business strategy and plans, or that financial, technological, market, or other limitations may force us to modify, alter, significantly delay, or significantly impede the implementation of such plans. We have insufficient results for investors to use to identify historical trends. Investors should consider our prospects in light of the risk, expenses and difficulties we will encounter as an early stage company. Our revenue and income potential is unproven and our business model is continually evolving. We are subject to the risks inherent to the operation of a new business enterprise, and cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these risks.\nWe have a limited operating history upon which to evaluate our ability to commercialize our products.\nWe are a clinical stage company and our success is dependent upon our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our products and we have not demonstrated an ability to perform the functions necessary for the approval or successful commercialization of any product candidates. The successful commercialization of any product candidates will require us to perform a variety of functions, including:\n\u00b7\ncontinuing to undertake preclinical development and successfully enroll patients in clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nparticipating in regulatory approval processes;\n\u00b7\nformulating and manufacturing products; and\n\u00b7\nconducting sales and marketing activities.\nWhile various members of our management and staff have prior significant experience in conducting cancer trials, our company, to date, we have not successfully completed any late stage clinical trials and we have limited experience conducting and enrolling patients in clinical trials. Until recently, our operations, including the operations of Pelican, have been limited primarily to organizing and staffing, acquiring, developing and securing our proprietary technology and undertaking preclinical trials and preparing for our early clinical and preclinical trials of our product candidates. These operations provide a limited basis for you to assess our ability to commercialize our product candidates and the advisability of investing in our securities.\nWe have incurred net losses every year since our inception and expect to continue to generate operating losses and experience negative cash flows and it is uncertain whether we will achieve profitability.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we incurred a net loss of $16.6 million and $12.4 million, respectively. We have an accumulated deficit of $84.6 million through December 31, 2018. We expect to continue to incur operating losses until such time, if ever, as we are able to achieve sufficient levels of revenue from operations. Our ability to achieve profitability will depend on us obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates and market acceptance of our product offerings and our capacity to develop, introduce and sell our products to our targeted markets. There can be no assurance that any of our product candidates will be approved for commercial sale, or even if our product candidates are approved for commercial sale that we will ever generate significant sales or achieve profitability. Accordingly, the extent of future losses and the time required to achieve profitability, if ever, cannot be predicted at this point.\nEven if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more product candidates, we expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable. We also expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses and anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we:\n\u00b7\ncontinue to undertake preclinical development and conduct clinical trials for product candidates;\n\u00b7\nseek regulatory approvals for product candidates;\n\u00b7\nimplement additional internal systems and infrastructure; and\n\u00b7\nhire additional personnel.\nWe also expect to experience negative cash flows for the foreseeable future as we fund our operating losses. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues or raise additional financing in order to achieve and maintain profitability. We may not be able to generate these revenues or achieve profitability in the future. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability would likely negatively impact the value of our securities and financing activities.\nWe will need to raise additional capital to operate our business and our failure to obtain funding when needed may force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our development programs or commercialization efforts.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, our operating activities used net cash of approximately $21.7 million and as of December 31, 2018, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments were approximately $27.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, our operating activities used net cash of approximately $6.4 million and as of December 31, 2017 our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $9.8 million. We have experienced significant losses since inception and have a significant accumulated deficit. As of December 31, 2018, our accumulated deficit totaled approximately $84.6 million and as of December 31, 2017, our accumulated deficit totaled approximately $68.8 million on a consolidated basis. We expect to incur additional operating losses in the future and therefore expect our cumulative losses to increase. We do not expect to derive revenue from any significant source in the near future until we or our potential partners successfully commercialize our products. Despite cost-saving measures that we implemented, we expect our expenses to increase if and when we initiate and conduct Phase 3 and other clinical trials, and seek marketing approval for our product candidates. Until such time as we receive approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities for our product candidates, we will not be permitted to sell our products and therefore will not have product revenues from the sale of products. For the foreseeable future, we will have to fund all of our operations and capital expenditures from equity and debt offerings, cash on hand, licensing fees and grants.\nWe expect that our current cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments will allow us to continue the enrollment of additional patients in the Phase 2 clinical trial for HS-110; however, if the trial design or size were to change, we may need to raise money earlier than anticipated.\nWe will need to raise additional capital to fund our future operations and we cannot be certain that funding will be available on acceptable terms on a timely basis, or at all. To meet our financing needs, we are considering multiple alternatives, including, but not limited to, current and additional equity financings, which we expect will include sales of common stock through at the market issuances, debt financings and/or funding from partnerships or collaborations. Our ability to raise capital through the sale of securities may be limited by the various rules of the SEC and the NASDAQ Capital Market that place limits on the number and dollar amount of securities that we may sell. There can be no assurance that we will be able to meet the requirements for use of at-market-issuance agreements, especially in light of the fact that we are subject to the smaller reporting company requirements, or to complete any such transactions on acceptable terms or otherwise. Any additional sources of financing will likely involve the issuance of our equity or debt securities, which will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may impact our ability to conduct our business. If we do not succeed in raising additional funds on acceptable terms, we may be unable to complete planned preclinical and clinical trials or obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA and other regulatory authorities, or continue to maintain our listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market. In addition, we could be forced to delay, discontinue or curtail product development, forego sales and marketing efforts, and forego licensing in attractive business opportunities. Any additional sources of financing will likely involve the issuance of our equity or debt securities, which will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders.\nWe currently have no product revenues and may not generate product revenue at any time in the near future, if at all.\nWe currently have no products for sale and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have any drug products approved for sale. We and our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries governing, among other things, research, testing, clinical trials, manufacturing, labeling, promotion, marketing, adverse event reporting and recordkeeping of our product candidates. Until, and unless, we receive approval from the FDA and other regulatory authorities for our product candidates, we cannot commercialize our product candidates and will not have product revenues. In addition, the technology that we out-licensed is in the early stages of development and there is a low likelihood of success for any such technology at that stage, therefore there can be no assurance that any products will be developed by such licensee or that we will derive any revenue from such licensee. For the foreseeable future, we will have to fund all of our operations from equity and debt offerings, cash on hand and grants. In addition, changes may occur that would consume our available capital at a faster pace than expected, including changes in and progress of our development activities, acquisitions of additional candidates and changes in regulation. Moreover, preclinical studies and clinical trials may not start or be completed as we forecast and may not achieve the desired results. Therefore, we expect that we will seek additional sources of funding, such as additional financing or grant funding, and additional financing may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. Our ability to raise capital through the sale of equity may be limited by the various rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and The NASDAQ Capital Market that place limits on the number of shares of stock that may be sold. If we do not succeed in raising additional funds on acceptable terms, we may be unable to complete planned preclinical and clinical trials or obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In addition, we could be forced to delay, discontinue or curtail product development, forego sales and marketing efforts, and forego licensing in attractive business opportunities. Any additional sources of financing will likely involve the issuance of our equity or debt securities, which will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately\nreport our financial results, and current and potential stockholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. During the second quarter of 2017, we identified a material weakness in our controls over financial reporting related to the purchase price accounting for the acquisition that occurred during the quarter. Specifically, we did not design and maintain effective controls related to the acquisition for the purchase price of the acquired assets and liabilities of Pelican. Although the control deficiencies were remediated by the end of the fiscal year there can be no assurance that the internal control over financial reporting, as modified, will enable us to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the future.\nWe are substantially dependent on the success of our product candidates, only one of which is currently being tested in a clinical trial, and we cannot provide any assurance that any of our product candidates will be commercialized.\nOur main focus and the investment of a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources has been in the development of our product candidate, HS-110, for which we are currently actively conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial. HS-110 is in clinical stage development. Our other product candidates are all at a pre-clinical stage. We expect that at least one Phase 3 clinical trial of HS-110 will be required to gain approval by the FDA. Our future success depends heavily on our ability to successfully manufacture, develop, obtain regulatory approval, and commercialize our product candidates, which may never occur. Before commercializing this product candidate, we will require additional clinical trials and regulatory approvals for which there can be no guarantee that we will be successful. We currently generate no revenues from any of our product candidates, and we may never be able to develop or commercialize a marketable drug.\nIf we experience delays in the enrollment of patients in our clinical trials, our receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nOur inability to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients in our clinical trials for any of our current or future clinical trials, would result in significant delays or may require us to abandon one or more clinical trials. Our ability to enroll patients in trials is affected by many factors out of our control, including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials, and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nIf we do not obtain the necessary regulatory approvals in the United States and/or other countries we will not be able to sell our product candidates.\nWe cannot assure you that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize any of our product candidates or any product candidates we acquire or develop in the future. We will need FDA approval to commercialize our product candidates in the United States and approvals from the FDA-equivalent regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions to commercialize our product candidates in those jurisdictions. In order to obtain FDA approval of any product candidate, we must submit to the FDA a BLA, demonstrating that the product candidate is safe, pure and potent, or effective for its intended use. This demonstration requires significant research including preclinical studies, as well as clinical trials. Satisfaction of the FDA\u2019s regulatory requirements typically takes many years, depends upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidate and requires substantial resources for research, development and testing. We cannot predict whether our clinical trials will demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates or if the results of any clinical trials will be sufficient to advance to the next phase of development or for approval from the FDA. We also cannot predict whether our research and clinical approaches will result in drugs or therapeutics that the FDA considers safe and effective for the proposed indications. The FDA has substantial discretion in the drug approval process. The approval process may be delayed by changes in government regulation, future legislation or administrative action or changes in FDA policy that occur prior to or during our regulatory review. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals may:\n\u00b7\nprevent or delay commercialization of, and our ability to derive product revenues from, our product candidates; and\n\u00b7\ndiminish any competitive advantages that we may otherwise believe that we hold.\nEven if we comply with all FDA requests, the FDA may ultimately reject one or more of our BLAs. We may never obtain regulatory clearance for any of our product candidates. Failure to obtain FDA approval of any of our product candidates will severely undermine our business by leaving us without a saleable product, and therefore without any source of revenues, until another product candidate can be developed. There is no guarantee that we will ever be able to develop or acquire another product candidate.\nIn addition, the FDA may require us to conduct additional preclinical and clinical testing or to perform post-marketing studies, as a condition to granting marketing approval of a product. Regulatory approval of oncology products often requires that patients in clinical trials be followed for long periods to assess their overall survival. The results generated after approval could result in loss of marketing approval, changes in product labeling, and/or new or increased concerns about the side effects or efficacy of a product. The FDA has significant post-market authority, including the explicit authority to require post-market studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information, and compliance with FDA-approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. The FDA\u2019s exercise of its authority has in some cases resulted, and in the future, could result, in delays or increased costs during product development, clinical trials and regulatory review, increased costs to comply with additional post-approval regulatory requirements and potential restrictions on sales of approved products.\nIn foreign jurisdictions, we must also receive approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities before we can commercialize any vaccines. Foreign regulatory approval processes generally include all of the risks associated with the FDA approval procedures described above. There can be no assurance that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize our product candidates for sale outside the United States.\nOur product candidates are in early stages of development, and therefore they will require extensive preclinical and clinical testing.\nBecause our product candidates are in early stages of development they will require extensive preclinical and clinical testing. HS-110 is our only current product candidate in clinical trials and our other product candidates are all in the preclinical stage of development. Although we have commenced a Phase 2 clinical trial for HS-110, we cannot predict with any certainty if or when we might submit a BLA for regulatory approval for any of our product candidates or whether any such BLA will be accepted for review by the FDA, or whether any BLA will be approved upon review.\nEven if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our proposed indications. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the results of later clinical trials will replicate the results of prior clinical trials and preclinical testing. The results reported for our initial 76 patients in our Phase 1b/2 clinical trial for HS-110 may not be replicated with other patients or other clinical trials. For example, the Phase 1 HS-410 clinical trial, as well as the interim data from the Phase 2 HS-410 clinical study, showed evidence of an immune response in NMIBC patients exposed to HS-410, however, the topline data from the Phase 2 clinical trial reported that there was no statistically significant difference in the primary endpoint between the vaccine and placebo arms of the trial. The Phase 2 clinical trial of HS-410 used doses and dosing regimens which had not previously been tested, and combinations with other immunotherapy agents. In addition, immune response is not an acceptable regulatory endpoint for approval, and the HS-410 Phase 1 trial involved a small sample size and was not randomized or blinded. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for their proposed uses. This failure could cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of other product candidates. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will delay and possibly preclude the filing of any BLAs with the FDA and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate product revenues.\nClinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to design and implement.\nAs part of the regulatory process, we must conduct clinical trials for each product candidate to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA and other regulatory authorities. The number and design of the clinical trials that will be required varies depending upon product candidate, the condition being evaluated and the trial results themselves. Therefore, it is difficult to accurately estimate the cost of the clinical trials. Clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. The clinical trial process is also time consuming. We estimate that clinical trials of our product candidates will take at least several years to complete. Furthermore, failure can occur at any stage of the trials, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials. The commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed or prevented by several factors, including:\n\u00b7\nunforeseen safety issues;\n\u00b7\nfailure to determine appropriate dosing;\n\u00b7\ngreater than anticipated cost of our clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nfailure to demonstrate effectiveness during clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nslower than expected rates of patient recruitment or difficulty obtaining investigators;\n\u00b7\npatient drop-out or discontinuation;\n\u00b7\ninability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment;\n\u00b7\nthird party contractors failing to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner;\n\u00b7\ninsufficient or inadequate supply or quality of product candidates or other necessary materials to conduct our trials;\n\u00b7\npotential additional safety monitoring, or other conditions required by FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials, or other studies requested by regulatory agencies;\n\u00b7\nproblems engaging IRBs to oversee trials or in obtaining and maintaining IRB approval of studies;\n\u00b7\nimposition of clinical hold or suspension of our clinical trials by regulatory authorities; and\n\u00b7\ninability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols.\nIn addition, we or the FDA may suspend or terminate our clinical trials at any time if it appears that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if the FDA finds deficiencies in our Investigational New Drug, or IND, submissions or the conduct of these trials. Therefore, we cannot predict with any certainty when, if ever, future clinical trials will commence or be completed.\nWe are at risk of a clinical hold at any time based on the evaluation of the data and information submitted to the governing regulatory authorities. On February 2, 2016, we received notice from the FDA of a partial clinical hold on our Phase 2 HS-410 clinical trial despite the fact that we did not have a safety concern. The partial clinical hold came after we concluded that the cell line on which HS-410 is based had been previously misidentified. The partial clinical hold was lifted on February 10, 2016. However, if in the future we are delayed in addressing, or unable to address, any FDA concerns, we could be delayed, or prevented, from conducting our clinical trials.\nMisidentification of cell lines could impact our clinical development and intellectual property rights.\nOur product candidates are based on human cell lines produced by third parties and licensed by us. Cell line characterization and contamination is a known issue in biomedical research. For example, despite standard procedures to identify the origins and characteristics of our cell lines in early 2016 we discovered that the origin of the cell line used in HS-410 was misidentified. The misidentification resulted in the FDA placing our HS-410 Phase 2 clinical trial on partial clinical hold while the FDA reviewed certain updated documentation provided by us related to the misidentification. In the event we were to use a cell line in the future that is also misidentified, the clinical development of the product candidate utilizing the mischaracterized cell line could be materially and adversely affected, we could lose the right to use the cell line and our intellectual property rights relating to our development of product candidates based on that cell line could be materially and adversely affected. Although we have implemented certain additional procedures to properly identify our cell lines, we may not be able to detect that a cell line has been mischaracterized or mislabeled by a third party.\nThere is uncertainty as to market acceptance of our technology and product candidates.\nEven if the FDA approves one or more of our product candidates, the products may not gain broad market acceptance among physicians, healthcare payers, patients, and the medical community. We have conducted our own research into the markets for our product candidates; however, we cannot guarantee market acceptance of our product candidates, if approved, and have somewhat limited information on which to estimate our anticipated level of sales. Our product candidates, if approved, will require patients, healthcare providers and doctors to adopt our technology. Our industry is susceptible to rapid technological developments and there can be no assurance that we will be able to match any new technological advances. If we are unable to match the technological changes in the needs of our customers the demand for our products will be reduced. Acceptance and use of any products we market will depend upon a number of factors including:\n\u00b7\nperceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our products;\n\u00b7\nlimitation on use or warnings required by FDA in our product labeling;\n\u00b7\ncost-effectiveness of our products relative to competing products;\n\u00b7\nconvenience and ease of administration;\n\u00b7\npotential advantages of alternative treatment methods;\n\u00b7\navailability of reimbursement for our products from government or other healthcare payers; and\n\u00b7\neffectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors, if any.\nBecause we expect virtually all of our product revenues for the foreseeable future to be generated from sales of our current product candidates, if approved, the failure of these therapeutics to find market acceptance would substantially harm our business and would adversely affect our revenue.\nOur development program partially depends upon third-party researchers who are outside our control.\nWe are dependent upon independent investigators and collaborators, such as universities and medical institutions, to conduct our clinical trials under agreements with us. These collaborators are not our employees and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs. These investigators may not assign as great a priority to our programs or pursue them as diligently as we would if we were undertaking such programs ourselves. If outside collaborators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our development programs, or if their performance is substandard, the approval of our FDA applications, if any, and our introduction of new product candidates, if any, will be delayed if obtained at all. These collaborators may also have relationships with other commercial entities, some of whom may compete with us. If our collaborators assist our competitors at our expense, our competitive position would be harmed.\nWe rely significantly on third parties to formulate and manufacture our product candidates.\nWe have developed certain expertise in the formulation, development and/or manufacturing of biologics but do not intend to establish our own manufacturing facilities. To date, the selection and initial replication of our biological cell lines used in our trials has been performed by individuals working at third party laboratories over which we have little process or quality control and therefore the process and replication could be subject to human error. We lack the resources and expertise to formulate or manufacture our own product candidates. The investigational products for our clinical trials are manufactured by our contractors under current good manufacturing practices, (\u201ccGMPs\u201d) and we have entered into agreements with commercial-scale manufacturers for the production and supply of investigational product for additional Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials as well as commercialization. Our agreement with the manufacturer of our HS-110 product expires in October 2019, and we have no assurance that we can extend current agreement or renegotiate our agreement on favorable terms if at all. Manufacturing considerations which may include, lead time and capacity considerations of our third-party manufacturers to provide clinical supply of our product candidates, could delay our clinical trials. We must also develop and validate a potency assay prior to submission of a license application. Such assays have traditionally proven difficult to develop for cell-based products and must be established prior to initiating any Phase 3 clinical trials. If any of our current product candidates, or any product candidates we may develop or acquire in the future, receive FDA approval, we will rely on one or more third-party contractors for manufacturing. Our anticipated future reliance on a limited number of third-party manufacturers exposes us to the following risks:\n\u00b7\nWe may be unable to renew or renegotiate current agreements on favorable terms, or identify manufacturers on acceptable terms or at all because the number of potential manufacturers with appropriate expertise and facilities is limited.\n\u00b7\nIf we change manufacturers at any point during the development process or after approval, we will be required to demonstrate comparability between the products made by the old and new manufacturers. If we are unable to do so, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials with product manufactured by the new manufacturer. Accordingly, it may be necessary to evaluate the comparability of the HS-110 or other product candidates produced by the two different manufacturers at some point during the clinical development process.\n\u00b7\nIf we change the manufacturer of a product subsequent to the approval of the product, we will need to obtain approval from the FDA of the change in manufacturer. Any such approval would likely require significant testing and expense, and the new manufacturer may be subject to a cGMP inspection prior to approval.\n\u00b7\nOur third-party manufacturers might be unable to formulate and manufacture our product candidates in the volume and with the quality required to meet our clinical needs and commercial needs, if any.\n\u00b7\nOur contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce, store and distribute our product candidates.\n\u00b7\nDrug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA, and corresponding state agencies to ensure compliance with cGMPs and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards.\n\u00b7\nIf any third-party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our products, we may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to the innovation.\n\u00b7\nOur contract manufacturers have in the past and may in the future encounter difficulties in achieving quality control and quality assurance and may experience shortages in qualified personnel. Our contract manufacturers are subject to inspections by the FDA and comparable agencies in other jurisdictions to assess compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Any failure to follow cGMP or other regulatory requirements or delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, packaging, or storage of our products as a result of a failure of the facilities or operations of third parties to comply with regulatory requirements or pass any regulatory authority inspection could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products, including leading to significant delays in the availability of products for our clinical studies or the termination or hold on a clinical study, or the delay or prevention of a filing or approval of marketing applications for our product candidates. Significant noncompliance could also result in the imposition of sanctions, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure of regulatory authorities to grant marketing approvals for our product candidates, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocation, seizures or recalls of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could damage our reputation. If we or our contract manufacturers are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our products and/or may be subject to product recalls, seizures, injunctions, or criminal prosecution.\nEach of these risks could delay our clinical trials, the approval, if any, of our product candidates by the FDA or the commercialization of our product candidates or could also result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenues.\nFor our product candidates, we rely upon third parties to manufacture and supply our drug substance. Any problems experienced by either our third-party manufacturers or their vendors could result in a delay or interruption in the supply of our product candidate to us until the third-party manufacturer or its vendor cures the problem or until we locate and qualify an alternative source of manufacturing and supply.\nFor our product candidates, we currently rely on third-party manufacturers to purchase from their third-party vendors the materials necessary to produce our product candidates and manufacture our product candidates for our clinical studies. If any of our third-party manufacturers were to experience any prolonged disruption for our manufacturing we could be forced to seek additional third party manufacturing contracts, thereby increasing our development costs and negatively impacting our timeliness and any commercialization costs.\nFor our ongoing clinical trial of HS-110, we are administering our product candidates, in combination with other immunotherapy agents. Any problems obtaining the other immunotherapy agents could result in a delay or interruption in our clinical trials.\nFor our ongoing clinical trials of HS-110, we administer our product candidate in combination with another immunotherapy agent, nivolumab or pembrolizumab. Therefore, our success will be dependent upon the continued use of these other immunotherapy agents. We expect that our other product candidates will also be administered in combination with immunotherapy agents owned by third parties. If any of the immunotherapy agents that are used in our clinical trials are unavailable while the trials are continuing, our timeliness and commercialization costs could be impacted. In addition, if any of these other immunotherapy agents are determined to have safety of efficacy problems, our clinical trials and commercialization efforts would be adversely affected.\nAdverse effects resulting from other immunotherapy drugs or therapies could also negatively affect the perceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates.\nThere are many other companies that have developed or are currently trying to develop immunology vaccines for the treatment of cancer. If adverse effects were to result from any immunotherapy drugs or therapies being developed, manufactured and marketed by others it could be attributed to our products or immunotherapy protocols as a whole. In fact, in the past biologics have been associated with certain safety risks and other companies developing biologics have had patients in trials suffer from serious adverse events, including death. Any such attribution could negatively affect the perceptions by members of the health care community, including physicians, about the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates and the future of immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer. Our industry is susceptible to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance that we will be able to match any new technological challenges presented by the adverse effects resulting from immunotherapy drugs or therapies developed, manufactured or marketed by others.\nEven if we are able to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will continue to be subject to ongoing and extensive regulatory requirements, and our failure, or the failure of our contract manufacturers, to comply with these requirements could substantially harm our business.\nIf the FDA approves any of our product candidates, the labeling, manufacturing, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and record keeping for our products will be subject to ongoing FDA requirements and continued regulatory oversight and review. We may also be subject to additional FDA post-marketing obligations. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may not be permitted to market our product candidates and/or may be subject to product recalls or seizures. The subsequent discovery of previously unknown problems with any marketed product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, may result in restrictions on the marketing of the product, and could include withdrawal of the product from the market.\nWe have no experience selling, marketing or distributing products, and have no internal capability to do so.\nWe currently have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. We do not anticipate having the resources in the foreseeable future to allocate to the sales and marketing of our proposed products, if approved. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to enter into and maintain collaborative relationships for such capabilities, the collaborator\u2019s strategic interest in the products under development and such collaborator\u2019s ability to successfully market and sell any such products. We intend to pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing of our products, however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements, or if able to do so, that our collaborators will have effective sales forces. To the extent that we decide not to, or are unable to, enter into collaborative arrangements with respect to the sales and marketing of our proposed products, significant capital expenditures, management resources and time will be required to establish and develop an in-house marketing and sales force with technical expertise. There can also be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain relationships with third party collaborators or develop in-house sales and distribution capabilities. To the extent that we depend on third parties for marketing and distribution, any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, and there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful. In addition, there can also be no assurance that we will be able to successfully market and sell our products in the United States or overseas on our own.\nWe may not be successful in establishing and maintaining strategic partnerships, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products.\nWe may seek to enter into strategic partnerships in the future, including alliances with other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, to enhance and accelerate the development and commercialization of our products. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for any future product candidates and programs because our research and development pipeline may be insufficient, our product candidates and programs may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort and/or third parties may not view our product candidates and programs as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy or return on investment. Even if we are successful in our efforts to establish strategic partnerships, the terms that we agree upon may not be favorable to us and we may not be able to maintain such strategic partnerships if, for example, development or approval of a product candidate is delayed or sales of an approved product are disappointing.\nIf we ultimately determine that entering into strategic partnerships is in our best interest, but either fail to enter into, are delayed in entering into or fail to maintain such strategic partnerships:\n\u00b7\nthe development of certain of our current or future product candidates may be terminated or delayed;\n\u00b7\nour cash expenditures related to development of certain of our current or future product candidates may increase significantly and we may need to seek additional financing;\n\u00b7\nwe may be required to hire additional employees or otherwise develop expertise, such as sales and marketing expertise, for which we have not budgeted;\n\u00b7\nwe will bear all of the risk related to the development of any such product candidates; and\n\u00b7\nthe competitiveness of any product candidate that is commercialized could be reduced.\nTo the extent we elect to enter into licensing or collaboration agreements to partner our product candidates, our dependence on such relationships may adversely affect our business.\nOur commercialization strategy for certain of our product candidates may depend on our ability to enter into agreements with collaborators to obtain assistance and funding for the development and potential commercialization of these product candidates. Supporting diligence activities conducted by potential collaborators and negotiating the financial and other terms of a collaboration agreement are long and complex processes with uncertain results. Even if we are successful in entering into one or more collaboration agreements, collaborations may involve greater uncertainty for us, as we have less control over certain aspects of our collaborative programs than we do over our proprietary development and commercialization programs. We may determine that continuing a collaboration under the terms provided is not in our best interest, and we may terminate the collaboration. Our collaborators could delay or terminate their agreements, and our product candidates subject to collaborative arrangements may never be successfully developed or commercialized.\nFurther, our future collaborators may develop alternative products or pursue alternative technologies either on their own or in collaboration with others, including our competitors, and the priorities or focus of our collaborators may shift such that our programs receive less attention or fewer resources than we would like, or they may be terminated altogether. Any such actions by our collaborators may adversely affect our business prospects and ability to earn revenues. In addition, we could have disputes with our future collaborators, such as the interpretation of terms in our agreements. Any such disagreements could lead to delays in the development or commercialization of any potential products or could result in time-consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration, which may not be resolved in our favor.\nIf we cannot compete successfully for market share against other drug companies, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.\nThe market for our product candidates is characterized by intense competition and rapid technological advances. If any of our product candidates receives FDA approval, it will compete with a number of existing and future drugs and therapies developed, manufactured and marketed by others. Existing or future competing products may provide greater therapeutic convenience or clinical or other benefits for a specific indication than our products, or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost. If our products fail to capture and maintain market share, we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer.\nWe will compete against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations. Many of these competitors have oncology compounds already approved or in development. In addition, many of these competitors, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, operate larger research and development programs or have substantially greater financial resources than we do, as well as significantly greater experience in:\n\u00b7\ndeveloping drugs, biologics and other therapies;\n\u00b7\nundertaking preclinical testing and clinical trials;\n\u00b7\nobtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of drugs, biologics and other therapies;\n\u00b7\nformulating and manufacturing drugs, biologics and other therapies; and\n\u00b7\nlaunching, marketing and selling drugs, biologics and other therapies.\nWe have limited protection for our intellectual property, which could impact our competitive position.\nWe intend to rely on a combination of common law copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret laws and measures to protect our proprietary information. We have obtained exclusive rights to license the technology for which patent protection has been obtained; however, certain patents expire in 2019 and such protection does not prevent unauthorized use of such technology. In addition, our license for certain cell lines are subject to non-exclusive licenses and do not have patent protection. Trademark and copyright protections may be limited, and enforcement could be too costly to be effective. It may also be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of, or otherwise obtain and use, our proprietary information without authorization, including, but not limited to, product design, software, customer and prospective customer lists, trade secrets, copyrights, patents and other proprietary rights and materials. Other parties can use and register confusingly similar business, product and service names, as well as domain names, which could divert customers, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our operating results. Competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents or future patents we may obtain. In addition, our licensed patents may not provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our licensed intellectual property rights. We may not be able to detect infringement and our competitive position may be harmed. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share.\nThe technology we license, our products or our development efforts may be found to infringe upon third-party intellectual property rights.\nThird parties may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to their patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights in technology that is important to us. The asserted claims and/or litigation could include claims against us, our licensors or our suppliers alleging infringement of intellectual property rights with respect to our products or components of those products. Regardless of the merit of the claims, they could be time consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel, or require us to develop a non-infringing technology or enter into license agreements. We have not undertaken an exhaustive search to discover any third party intellectual patent rights, which might be infringed by commercialization of the product candidates described herein. Although we are not currently aware of any such third-party intellectual patent rights, it is possible that such rights currently exist or might be obtained in the future. In the event that a third party controls such rights and we are unable to obtain a license to such rights on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to sell or continue to develop our products, and may be liable for damages for such infringement. We cannot assure you that licenses will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Furthermore, because of the potential for significant damage awards, which are not necessarily predictable, it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claims resulting in large settlements. If any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us by any third party is successful, or if we fail to develop non-infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on commercially reasonable terms and conditions, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nIf our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and we may have to:\n\u00b7\nobtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u00b7\nabandon an infringing drug or therapy candidate;\n\u00b7\nredesign our products or processes to avoid infringement;\n\u00b7\nstop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others;\n\u00b7\npay damages; or\n\u00b7\ndefend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.\nWe rely on licenses to use various technologies that are material to our business and if the agreements were to be terminated or if other rights that may be necessary or we deem advisable for commercializing our intended products cannot be obtained, it would halt our ability to market our products and technology, as well as have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe have licensing agreements with certain universities granting us the right to use certain critical intellectual property. The terms of the licensing agreements continue until the end of the life of the last patent to expire. If we breach the terms of these licensing agreements, including any failure to make minimum royalty payments required thereunder or failure to reach certain developmental milestones, using best efforts to introduce a licensed product in certain territories by certain dates, the licensor has the right to terminate the license. If we were to lose or otherwise be unable to maintain these licenses on acceptable terms, or find that it is necessary or appropriate to secure new licenses from other third parties, it would halt our ability to market our products and technology, which would have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to meet the minimum annual payments or developmental milestones required under our license agreements.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 our minimum annual payment obligations under our licensing agreements, (including the licenses that Pelican has entered into), required to be paid by us with the passage of time, are approximately $0.07 million, $0.1 million, $0.2 million, $0.8 million and $0.07 million, respectively. No assurance can be given that we will generate sufficient revenue or raise additional financing to make these minimum royalty payments or milestone payments owed to the Participating Pelican Stockholders. The license agreements also provide for certain developmental milestones, as does the Purchase Agreement we entered into with the Participating Pelican Stockholders, including future payments to Pelican based on the achievement of certain milestones. No assurance can be given that we will meet all of the required developmental milestones. Any failure to make the payments or reach the milestones required by the license agreements would permit the licensor to terminate the license. If we were to lose or otherwise be unable to maintain these licenses, it would halt our ability to market our products and technology, which would have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur ability to generate product revenues will be diminished if our therapies sell for inadequate prices or patients are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement.\nOur ability to commercialize our therapies, alone or with collaborators, will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement will be available from:\n\u00b7\ngovernment and health administration authorities;\n\u00b7\nprivate health maintenance organizations and health insurers; and\n\u00b7\nother healthcare payers.\nSignificant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. Healthcare payers, including Medicare, are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we would receive for any products in the future, which would limit our revenue and profitability. Government and other healthcare payers increasingly attempt to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for drugs and therapeutics. We might need to conduct post-marketing studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any future products to such payers\u2019 satisfaction. Such studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources. Our future products might not ultimately be considered cost-effective. Even if one of our product candidates is approved by the FDA, insurance coverage may not be available, and reimbursement levels may be inadequate, to cover such therapies. If government and other healthcare payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for one of our products, once approved, market acceptance of such product could be reduced.\nLegislative and regulatory changes affecting the health care industry could adversely affect our business.\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the health care industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. In many countries, the government controls the pricing and profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals. In the United States, we expect that there will continue to be federal and state proposals to implement similar governmental controls. In addition, recent changes in the Medicare program and increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on pharmaceutical product pricing. It is uncertain whether or when any legislative proposals will be adopted or what actions federal, state, or private payers for health care treatment and services may take in response to any health care reform proposal or legislation. We cannot predict the effect health care reforms may have on our business and we can offer no assurances that any of these reforms will not have a material adverse effect on our business. These actual and potential changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective treatments. In addition, uncertainly remains regarding proposed significant reforms to the U.S. health care system.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, prevent or delay marketing approval of our clinical product candidate, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements, (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling, (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAmong policy makers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. In March 2010, the ACA, was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, subjects biological products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, addresses a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increases the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, establishes annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and creates a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% (70% as of January 1, 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.\nSome of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties, starting January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA\u2019s individual mandate to carry health insurance and delaying the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees. On December 14, 2018, the Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. While the Texas District Court Judge, as well as the Trump Administration and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, have stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business.\nMoreover, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of prescription drugs in finished dosage forms. We have not yet adopted the significant measures that will be required to comply with this law. We are not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the current regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on our business, if any, may be.\nThere have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.\nWe expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products, which could result in reduced demand for our clinical product candidate or additional pricing pressures. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nWe may not successfully effect our intended expansion, which would harm our business prospects.\nOur success will depend upon the expansion of our operations and the effective management of our growth, which will place a significant strain on our management, and on our administrative, operational and financial resources. To manage this growth, we must expand our facilities; augment our operational, financial and management systems; and hire and train additional qualified personnel. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business would be harmed.\nWe may be exposed to liability claims associated with the use of biological and hazardous materials and chemicals.\nOur research and development activities may involve the controlled use of biological and hazardous materials and chemicals. Although we believe that our safety procedures for using, storing, handling and disposing of these materials comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials. We currently operate one laboratory in North Carolina and Pelican operates a laboratory in Texas. In our laboratory in Texas we perform contract services for third parties that could involve the use of biological and hazardous materials and chemicals. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or radioactive materials and waste products may require us to incur substantial compliance costs that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on key executive officers and scientific and medical advisors, and their knowledge of our business and technical expertise would be difficult to replace.\nWe are highly dependent on our principal scientific, regulatory and medical advisors and our chief executive officer. Other than a $2.0 million insurance policy we hold on the life of Jeffrey Wolf, we do not have \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies for any of our officers or advisors. The loss of the technical knowledge, management and industry expertise of any of our key personnel could result in delays in product development, loss of customers and sales and diversion of management resources, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our ability to grow our business may be harmed.\nWe will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in preclinical and clinical research, government regulation, formulation and manufacturing, sales and marketing and accounting and financing. In particular, over the next 12 months, we expect to hire additional new employees both in North Carolina and for Pelican in Texas. In fact, due to the CPRIT Grant and certain other funding we have received, we are required to hire employees located in Texas. We compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions. Competition for such individuals is intense, and we cannot be certain that our search for such personnel will be successful especially in light of the CPRIT Grant requirements, including the requirement that Pelican maintain its headquarters in Texas and use certain vendors, consultants and employees located in Texas. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success.\nWe may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products in response to product liability lawsuits.\nThe testing and marketing of drug and biological product candidates entail an inherent risk of product liability. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products. We currently operate one laboratory in North Carolina and Pelican operates a laboratory in Texas. In our laboratory in Texas we perform contract services for third parties. We could incur liability in the performance of these services, including liability for damage to materials supplied to us. Clinical trial liability claims may be filed against us for damages suffered by clinical trial subjects or their families. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our products which could impact our ability to continue as a going concern. Our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop, alone or with collaborators. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7\ndecreased demand for any approved product candidates;\n\u00b7\nimpairment of our business reputation;\n\u00b7\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7\ncosts of related litigation;\n\u00b7\ndistraction of management\u2019s attention;\n\u00b7\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u00b7\nloss of revenues; and\n\u00b7\nthe inability to successfully commercialize any approved drug candidates.\nInternational expansion of our business exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial and economic risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\nOur business strategy incorporates international expansion, including establishing and maintaining clinician marketing and education capabilities outside of the United States and expanding our relationships with distributors and manufacturers. Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including:\n\u00b7\nmultiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses;\n\u00b7\nfailure by us or our distributors to obtain regulatory approvals for the sale or use of our product candidates in various countries;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in managing foreign operations;\n\u00b7\ncomplexities associated with managing multiple payor-reimbursement regimes or self-pay systems;\n\u00b7\nlimits on our ability to penetrate international markets if our product candidates cannot be processed by a manufacturer appropriately qualified in such markets;\n\u00b7\nfinancial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nnatural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism and political unrest, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions; and\n\u00b7\nfailure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, including its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions, by maintaining accurate information and control over sales and distributors\u2019 activities.\nAny of these risks, if encountered, could significantly harm our future international expansion and operations and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may acquire other businesses or form joint ventures or make investments in other companies or technologies that could harm our operating results, dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership, increase our debt or cause us to incur significant expense.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may pursue acquisitions of businesses and assets, such as we did with the Pelican. We also may pursue strategic alliances and joint ventures that leverage our core technology and industry experience to expand our offerings or distribution. Other than our recent acquisition of 80% of the equity of Pelican, we have no experience with acquiring other companies and limited experience with forming strategic alliances and joint ventures. We may not be able to find suitable partners or acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete such transactions on favorable terms, if at all. If we make any acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate these acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities. Any future acquisitions also could result in significant write-offs or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Integration of an acquired company also may disrupt ongoing operations and require management resources that would otherwise focus on developing our existing business. We may experience losses related to investments in other companies, which could have a material negative effect on our results of operations. We may not identify or complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, technology license, strategic alliance or joint venture.\nTo finance any acquisitions or joint ventures, we may choose to issue shares of our common stock as consideration, which would dilute the ownership of our stockholders. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies or fund a joint venture project using our stock as consideration. Alternatively, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds for acquisitions through public or private financings. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\nUncertainty regarding health care reform and declining general economic or business conditions may have a negative impact on our business.\nContinuing concerns over U.S. health care reform legislation and energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit and government stimulus programs in the United States and other countries have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the global economy. If the economic climate does not improve or continues to be uncertain, our business, as well as the financial condition of our suppliers and our third-party payors, could be adversely affected, resulting in a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. government may have \u201cmarch-in rights\u201d to certain of our intellectual property.\nBecause federal grant monies were used in support of the research and development activities that resulted in certain of our issued pending U.S. patent applications, the federal government retains what are referred to as \u201cmarch-in rights\u201d to patents that are granted on these applications.\nIn particular, the National Institutes of Health, which administered grant monies to the primary inventor of the technology we license, technically retain the right to require us, under certain specific circumstances, to grant the U.S. government either a nonexclusive, partially exclusive or exclusive license to the patented invention in any field of use, upon terms that are reasonable for a particular situation. Circumstances that trigger march-in rights include, for example, failure to take, within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the invention in a field of use, failure to satisfy the health and safety needs of the public and failure to meet requirements of public use specified by federal regulations. The National Institutes of Health can elect to exercise these march-in rights on their own initiative or at the request of a third-party.\nIn order to develop Pelican\u2019s product candidates and receive the grant funding awarded by CPRIT, we will have to devote significant resources to Pelican.\nNeither we nor Pelican are expected to derive revenue from any source in the near future until they or other potential partners successfully commercialize products. The CPRIT Grant requires that Pelican provide matching funds for one half of the award amount in order for Pelican to receive the grant funding. In order to receive the full $15.2 million award over three years, Pelican must raise matching funds in the aggregate amount of approximately $7.6 million. Pelican has received funding from us in the amount of approximately $5.2 million as of December 31, 2018 of which $4.1 million was used to satisfy Pelican\u2019s matching fund obligation under the first two years of the CPRIT Grant. CPRIT has made available to Pelican an aggregate of $8.3 million. For the third year of the award Pelican must provide matching funds of approximately $3.5 million in order for CPRIT to provide approximately $6.9 million of grant funding. In addition, Heat provided Pelican approximately $0.3 million to pay Pelican\u2019s legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Acquisition in 2017. There can be no assurance that funding will be available on acceptable terms on a timely basis, or at all. The various ways that we could raise capital carry potential risks. Any additional sources of financing will likely involve the issuance of our equity securities, which will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders. If we raise funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we might be required to relinquish significant rights to our or Pelican\u2019s technologies or tests or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we do not succeed in raising additional funds on acceptable terms or at all, we may be unable to complete planned preclinical and clinical trials, access the CPRIT award or obtain approval of our product candidates from the FDA and other regulatory authorities.\nReliance on government funding for Pelican\u2019s programs may impose requirements that limit Pelican\u2019s ability to take certain actions, and subject it to potential financial penalties, which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant portion of Pelican\u2019s funding has been through a grant it received from the CPRIT Grant. The CPRIT Grant includes provisions that reflect the government\u2019s substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including powers of the government to potentially require repayment of all or a portion of the grant award proceeds, in certain cases with interest, in the event Pelican violates certain covenants pertaining to various matters that include any potential relocation outside of the State of Texas. After the CPRIT Grant ends, Pelican is not permitted to retain any unused grant award proceeds without CPRIT\u2019s approval, but Pelican\u2019s royalty and other obligations, including its obligation to repay the disbursed grant proceeds under certain circumstances, survive the termination of the agreement.\nPelican\u2019s award from CPRIT requires it to pay CPRIT a portion of its revenues from sales of certain products by it, or received from its licensees or sublicensees, at tiered percentages of revenue in the low- to mid-single digits until the aggregate amount of such payments equals 400% of the grant award proceeds, and thereafter at a rate of less than one percent for as long as Pelican maintains government exclusivity, subject to Pelican\u2019s right, under certain circumstances, to make a one-time payment in a specified amount to CPRIT to terminate such payment obligations. In addition, the grant contract also contains a provision that provides for repayment to CPRIT of some amount not to exceed the full amount of the grant proceeds under certain specified circumstances involving relocation of Pelican\u2019s principal place of business outside Texas.\nThe CPRIT Grant requires Pelican, as a Texas-based company, to meet certain criteria, including among other things, that Pelican maintain its headquarters in Texas and use certain vendors, consultants and employees that are located in Texas. As Pelican expands its operations, it will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in preclinical testing, clinical research and testing, government regulation, formulation and manufacturing, sales and marketing and accounting and financing located in Texas. Pelican will compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions. Competition for such individuals is intense, and there can be no assurance that the search for such personnel will be successful, especially in light of the territorial restrictions imposed by CPRIT. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to Pelican\u2019s access to the CPRIT Grant.\nIf Pelican fails to maintain compliance with any such requirements that may apply to it now or in the future, it may be subject to potential liability and to termination of its contracts, including potentially the CPRIT Grant.\nIf Pelican is unable to hire additional qualified personnel, its ability to utilize the CPRIT Grant will be forfeited.\nIn order to access the CPRIT Grant a majority of Pelican\u2019s employees must reside in Texas as well as its Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers. Pelican has identified qualified individuals and will have to negotiate agreements with each identified individual and will also need to hire such additional qualified personnel with expertise in preclinical testing, clinical research and testing, government regulation, formulation and manufacturing, sales and marketing and accounting and financing. Pelican will compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions. Competition for such individuals is intense, and there can be no assurance that the search for such personnel will be successful. Attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to Pelican\u2019s access to the CPRIT Grant.\nThe combined company may not experience the anticipated strategic benefits of our acquisition of Pelican.\nWe believe that the acquisition will provide certain strategic benefits that may not be realized by each of the companies if Pelican was not acquired by us. Specifically, we believe the acquisition provides certain strategic benefits which would enable us to accelerate our business plan through an increased access to capital in the public equity markets. There can be no assurance that these anticipated benefits of the acquisition will materialize or that if they materialize will result in increased stockholder value or revenue stream to the combined company.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 we reported under an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and any decision on our part to comply with certain reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nAs of January 1, 2019, we are no longer an emerging growth company under the JOBS ACT. However, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we were an emerging growth company. An \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined under the JOBS ACT, and, for as long as we continued to be an emerging growth company, we could choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, not being required to comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d), requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor's report in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer, not being required to comply with any new audit rules adopted by the PCAOB after April 5, 2012 unless the SEC determines otherwise, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nUnder the JOBS ACT, a company should be deemed an emerging growth company until the earliest of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer. We elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the JOBS Act, that allowed us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. Further, as a result of these scaled regulatory requirements, our disclosure may be more limited than that of other public companies and you may not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of such companies.\nWe ceased to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d which means we will no longer be able to take advantage of certain reduced disclosure requirements in our public filings.\nWe ceased to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, on December 31, 2018. As a result, we anticipate that costs and compliance initiatives will increase as a result of the fact that we ceased to be an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d In particular, we are now, or will be, subject to certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that had not been applicable to us as an emerging growth company. These requirements include:\n\u00b7\ncompliance with the auditor attestation requirements in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting once we are an accelerated filer or large accelerated filer;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;\n\u00b7\nfull disclosure and analysis obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n\u00b7\ncompliance with regulatory requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable regulations in a timely manner, if at all.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market could result in a de-listing of our common stock.\nOur shares of common stock are currently listed on The NASDAQ Capital Market. If we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Capital Market, such as the corporate governance requirements, minimum bid price requirement or the minimum stockholder\u2019s equity requirement, The NASDAQ Capital Market may take steps to de-list our common stock. Any de-listing would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair stockholders\u2019 ability to sell or purchase their common stock when they wish to do so. In the past we have received notices from the Listing Qualifications Department of NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) that we failed to comply with the stockholders equity requirements and the minimum closing bid requirements. Although we have satisfied the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ with respect to stockholders\u2019 equity and the minimum bid price requirements, there can be no assurance that we will continue to satisfy such requirements.\nThe possible issuance of common stock subject to options, restricted stock units and warrants may dilute the interests of stockholders.\nIn 2009, we adopted a 2009 Incentive Stock Plan (the \u201c2009 Plan\u201d). In 2014, we adopted a 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201c2014 Plan\u201d) and, in 2016 and 2015, we increased the number of shares of common stock that we have authority to grant under the 2014 Plan to a total of 3 million shares (300,000 shares post-reverse stock split). In 2017, we adopted a 2017 Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201c2017 Plan\u201d). In addition, at our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our 2018 Stock Incentive Plan (the \u201c2018 Plan\u201d) was approved by our stockholders, which provides for the issuance of up to 4,000,000 shares of common stock as compensation awards. As of December 31, 2018, awards for (i) 23,799 shares of common stock are outstanding under the 2009 Plan, (ii) 263,484 shares of common stock are outstanding under the 2014 Plan, (iii) 234,540 shares of common stock are outstanding under 2017 Plan and 0 shares are outstanding under the 2018 Plan, which resulted in (i) 34,290 shares of common stock, (ii) 12,358 shares, (iii) 213,567 shares, and (iv) 4,000,000 shares of common stock, respectively, remaining available for grants under the 2009 Plan, 2014 Plan, 2017, and 2018 Plan, respectively.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2018, we have issued warrants exercisable for 1,738 shares of our common stock to third parties in connection with prior private placements of our equity securities and debt and warrants exercisable for 9,028,992 shares of our common stock to third parties in connection with our public offerings. To the extent that outstanding stock options and warrants are exercised, or additional securities are issued, dilution to the interests of our stockholders may occur. Moreover, the terms upon which we will be able to obtain additional equity capital may be adversely affected since the holders of the outstanding options can be expected to exercise them at a time when we would, in all likelihood, be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable to us than those provided in such outstanding options.\nWe have additional securities available for issuance, which, if issued, could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of 100,000,000 shares of our common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. In certain circumstances, the common stock and preferred stock, as well as the awards available for issuance under the 2009, 2014, 2017, and 2018 Plans, can be issued by our board of directors, without stockholder approval. Any future issuances of such stock would further dilute the percentage ownership of us held by holders of preferred stock and common stock. In addition, the issuance of preferred stock may be used as an \u201canti-takeover\u201d device without further action on the part of our stockholders, and may adversely affect the holders of the common stock. Our board of directors is authorized to create and issue from time to time, without stockholder approval, up to an aggregate of 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock of which 8,212,500 have been designated, in one or more series and to establish the number of shares of any series of preferred stock and to fix the designations, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each series and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions of the shares of each series. The authority to designate preferred stock may be used to issue series of preferred stock, or rights to acquire preferred stock, that could dilute the interest of, or impair the voting power of, holders of the common stock or could also be used as a method of determining, delaying or preventing a change of control.\nWe have never paid dividends and have no plans to pay dividends in the future.\nHolders of shares of our common stock are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by our board of directors. To date, we have paid no cash dividends on our shares of our preferred or common stock and we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain future earnings, if any, to provide funds for operations of our business. Therefore, any return investors in our preferred or common stock may have will be in the form of appreciation, if any, in the market value of their shares of common stock.\nCertain provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, our bylaws and stockholder rights plan may have anti-takeover effects that may make an acquisition of our company by another company more difficult.\nWe are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination, including mergers and asset sales, with an interested stockholder (generally, a 15% or greater stockholder) for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. The operation of Section 203 may have anti-takeover effects, which could delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest. Certain provisions of our bylaws including the ability of our board of directors to fill vacancies on our board of directors and advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations may prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. In addition, the Rights issued pursuant to our stockholder rights plan that we implemented, if not redeemed or suspended, could result in the dilution of the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors and therefore discouraging, delaying or preventing a change in control that stockholders may consider favorable.\nFuture sales of our common stock by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline.\nOn March 28, 2019, we had 33,091,824 shares of our common stock outstanding, all of which are currently eligible for sale in the public market, subject, in certain circumstances to the volume, manner of sale and other limitations under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act. It is conceivable that stockholders may wish to sell some or all of their shares. If our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market at the same time, the market price of our common stock could decrease significantly due to an imbalance in the supply and demand of our common stock. Even if they do not actually sell the stock, the perception in the public market that our stockholders might sell significant shares of our common stock could also depress the market price of our common stock.\nA decline in the price of shares of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities, and may cause stockholders to lose part or all of their investment in our shares of common stock.\nOur shares of common stock are from time to time thinly traded, so stockholders may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if they need to sell shares to raise money or otherwise desire to liquidate their shares.\nOur common stock has from time to time been \u201cthinly-traded,\u201d meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common stock at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including the fact that we are a small company that is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume, and that even if we came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and would be reluctant to follow an unproven company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more seasoned and viable. As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer that has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. We cannot give stockholders any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for our common shares will develop or be sustained, or that current trading levels will be sustained.\nThe trading in our stock has in the past and may continue to be very volatile.\nOur stock price and the trading volume of our stock continues to be very volatile. As such, investors may find it difficult to obtain accurate stock price quotations and holders of our stock may be unable to resell their stock at desirable prices. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that such sales might occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock and our stock price may decline substantially in a short period of time. As a result, our stockholders could suffer losses or be unable to liquidate holdings.\nHolders of our warrants will have no rights as a common stockholder until they acquire our common stock.\nUntil warrant holders acquire shares of our common stock upon exercise of their warrants, the warrant holders will have no rights with respect to shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of their warrants. Upon exercise of the warrants, the warrant holders will be entitled to exercise the rights of a common stockholder only as to matters for which the record date occurs after the exercise date.\nOur previously issued warrants may not have any value.\nOur previously issued warrants to purchase shares of our common stock may not have any value. For example, we previously issued warrants in a public offering that have an exercise price of $10.00 per share (post-reverse stock split) and issued warrants to underwriters in connection with our initial public offering that have an exercise price of $125.00 per share (post-reverse stock split). In the event that our common stock price does not exceed the exercise price of our previously issued warrants during the period when the warrants are exercisable, the warrants may not have any value.\nThere is no established market for the warrants that we previously issued.\nThere is no established trading market for the warrants that we previously issued, including those issued in a public offering, and we do not expect a market to develop. In addition, we do not intend to apply for the listing of the warrants on any national securities exchange or other trading market. Without an active trading market, the liquidity of the warrants will be limited.\nThe shares of common stock offered under any at the market offering that we may engage in, and investors who buy shares at different times will likely pay different prices.\nInvestors who purchase shares that are sold under at-the-market-offerings at different times will likely pay different prices, and so may experience different outcomes in their investment results. We will have discretion, subject to market demand, to vary the timing, prices, and numbers of shares sold, and there is no minimum or maximum sales price. Investors may experience declines in the value of their shares as a result of share sales made at prices lower than the prices they paid.\nReports published by securities or industry analysts, including projections in those reports that exceed our actual results, could adversely affect our common stock price and trading volume.\nSecurities research analysts, including those affiliated with our underwriters from prior offerings, establish and publish their own periodic projections for our business. These projections may vary widely from one another and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our stock price may decline if our actual results do not match securities research analysts\u2019 projections. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who writes reports on us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business or if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, our stock price or trading volume could decline. While we expect securities research analyst coverage to continue going forward, if no securities or industry analysts begin to cover us, the trading price for our stock and the trading volume could be adversely affected.\nOur management team may invest or spend the proceeds of our prior offerings in ways with which stockholders may not agree or in ways that may not yield a significant return.\nOur management will have broad discretion over the use of proceeds from our November 2018 and May 2018 public offering, our at-the-market offering with H.C. Wainwright, and additional future financings. The net proceeds from these offerings are to be used for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, increasing our working capital, funding research and development, clinical trials, vendor payables, potential regulatory submissions, hiring additional personnel and capital expenditures. Our management has considerable discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and stockholders will not have the opportunity to assess whether the proceeds are being used appropriately. The net proceeds may be used for corporate purposes that do not improve our operating results or enhance the value of our common stock.\nOur need for future financing may result in the issuance of additional securities that will cause investors to experience dilution.\nOur cash requirements may vary from those now planned depending upon numerous factors, including the result of future research and development activities. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the research and development and initiate and conduct clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for, our product candidates. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. There are no other commitments by any person for future financing. Our securities may be offered to other investors at a price lower than the price per share offered to current stockholders, or upon terms that may be deemed more favorable than those offered to current stockholders. In addition, the issuance of securities in any future financing may dilute an investor's equity ownership and have the effect of depressing the market price for our securities. Moreover, we may issue derivative securities, including options and/or warrants, from time to time, to procure qualified personnel or for other business reasons. The issuance of any such derivative securities, which is at the discretion of our board of directors, may further dilute the equity ownership of our stockholders. No assurance can be given as to our ability to procure additional financing, if required, and on terms deemed favorable to us. To the extent additional capital is required and cannot be raised successfully, we may then have to limit our then current operations and/or may have to curtail certain, if not all, of our business objectives and plans.", "PERMNO": 14051, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "HTBX"}
