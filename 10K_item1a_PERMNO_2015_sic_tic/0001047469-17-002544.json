{"cik": "878079", "company": "BON TON STORES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-04-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nCautionary Statements Relating to Forward-Looking Information\nWe have made, including in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, other reports and communications with shareholders, forward-looking statements relating to developments, results, conditions or other events we expect or anticipate will occur. These statements may relate to revenues, earnings, store openings, business strategy, general economic conditions, market conditions and the competitive environment. The words or phrases \"believe,\" \"may,\" \"might,\" \"will,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"plan,\" \"look forward to\" and similar expressions as they relate to the Company, or future or conditional verbs, such as \"will,\" \"should,\" \"would,\" \"may\" and \"could,\" are intended to identify forward-looking statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on management's then-current views and assumptions and we undertake no obligation to update them. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those projected. The reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements.\nAn investment in our securities carries certain risks. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below, and other risks which may be disclosed in our filings with the SEC, before investing in our securities.\nGeneral economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nConsumer spending habits, including spending for the merchandise that we sell, are affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, prevailing interest rates and credit terms, housing costs, energy costs, income tax rates and policies, inflation, deflation, consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions. In addition, consumer purchasing patterns may be influenced by consumers' disposable income, credit availability and debt levels. A slowdown in the United States' economy or an uncertain economic outlook could adversely affect consumer spending habits, resulting in lower net sales and gross margin, which would cause reduced annual net profits or increased net losses, including the potential write-down of the current valuation of long-lived assets, intangible assets and deferred tax assets.\nOur vendors, landlords, lenders and other business partners could also be adversely affected by difficult economic conditions. This, in turn, could impact us through increasing the risk of bankruptcy of our vendors, landlords, lenders and business partners, increasing the cost of goods, creating a void in product, reducing access to liquid funds or credit, increasing the cost of credit or other impacts which we are unable to fully anticipate.\nReduced consumer traffic in traditional shopping malls could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nCustomer traffic in our stores is a significant factor in driving sales. We work to increase customer traffic and conversion both in stores and online. There is no assurance that we will be successful in increasing or retaining traffic and conversion levels. In addition, external events outside of our control, including closed anchor store locations, may dissuade customers from visiting shopping malls. There is\nno assurance that we will be able to reverse any decline in traffic or that increases in online sales will offset any decline in store traffic. We may need to respond to any declines in customer traffic or conversion rates by increasing markdowns or promotions to attract customers, which could adversely impact our financial results.\nWe conduct our operations in a highly competitive retail environment which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe compete with other department stores and many other retailers, including store-based, mail-order and internet retailers. Many of our competitors have financial and marketing resources that greatly exceed ours. The principal competitive factors in our business are price, quality and selection of merchandise, reputation, store location, advertising and customer service. We cannot ensure that we will be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors, or that prolonged periods of deep discount pricing by our competitors during periods of weak consumer confidence or economic instability will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Our expansion into new markets served by our competitors and the entry of new competitors into, or expansion of existing competitors in, our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrent store locations may become less desirable, and desirable new locations may not be available for a reasonable price, if at all.\nThe success of any store depends substantially upon its location. There can be no assurance that current locations will continue to be desirable as demographic patterns change. Neighborhood or economic conditions where stores are located could decline in the future, resulting in potentially reduced sales in those locations. In addition, if we cannot obtain desirable new locations our sales will suffer, and if we cannot obtain desirable locations at reasonable prices our cost structure will increase.\nThe financial condition of some shopping mall operators could adversely impact our stores.\nAs the great majority of our stores are located in malls, we are dependent upon the continued popularity of malls as a shopping destination for our customers. An economic slowdown in the United States could impact shopping mall operators' financial ability to develop new shopping malls and properly maintain existing shopping malls, which could adversely affect our sales. In addition, consolidation of ownership of shopping malls through the merger or acquisition of shopping mall operators may give landlords increased leverage in lease negotiations and adversely affect our ability to control our lease costs.\nThere can be no assurance that our liquidity will not be adversely affected by changes in the Company's performance or credit rating, financial markets or global economy.\nHistorically, we have generated cash flow from operating activities and used supplemental borrowings under our credit facility to provide the liquidity we need to operate our business. A downturn in the global economy and distress in the financial markets could result in volatility in the capital markets. Adverse changes in the Company's performance, a downgrade in our credit rating or the potential tightening of credit markets could make it more difficult for us to access funds, to refinance our existing indebtedness, to enter into agreements for new indebtedness or to obtain funding through the issuance of securities and could potentially increase our borrowing costs. If such conditions were to persist, we would seek alternative sources of liquidity, but there can be no assurance that we would be successful in obtaining such additional liquidity. As a result, we may not be able to meet our obligations as they become due. In addition, any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and could require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could harm our business.\nIn addition, vendors and their factors may potentially seek assurances to protect against non-payment of amounts due to them. If we experience declining operating performance, and if we experience severe liquidity challenges, vendors and their factors may demand that we accelerate payment for their products. These demands could have a significant adverse impact on our operating cash flow and result in a severe diminishment of our liquidity.\nOur debt could adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs of January 28, 2017, we had total debt, including capital lease and financing obligations, of $989.3 million, which is subject to restrictions and financial covenants. Our indebtedness, and the limitations imposed on us by the instruments and agreements governing such indebtedness, could result in events which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and/or business. For example, it could:\n\u2022 increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022 limit our ability to borrow money or sell equity to fund future working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022 require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow for other purposes, including capital expenditures;\n\u2022 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the retail industry;\n\u2022 make it more difficult for us to meet our debt service obligations in the event there is a substantial increase in interest rates because the debt under our senior secured credit facility bears interest at fluctuating rates;\n\u2022 restrict our ability to make certain types of investments, pay dividends, or sell all of our assets or merge or consolidate with another company; and\n\u2022 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have less debt.\nOur ability to service our debt depends upon, among other things, our ability to replenish inventory at competitive prices and terms, generate sales and maintain our stores. If we do not generate sufficient cash from our operations to service our debt obligations, we may need to take one or more actions, including refinancing our debt, obtaining additional financing, selling assets, obtaining additional equity capital or reducing or delaying capital expenditures. We cannot be certain that our cash flow will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations.\nDebt under our senior secured credit facility bears interest at a floating rate. Accordingly, changes in prevailing interest rates may affect our ability to meet our debt service obligations. A higher interest rate on our debt would adversely affect our operating results. If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or if we default under our credit facilities, our lenders could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accumulated and unpaid interest and other fees, immediately due and payable, and may foreclose on the collateral securing such indebtedness consisting of substantially all of our assets, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur discretion in some matters is limited by the restrictions contained in our debt facilities, which could harm our business, profitability and growth prospects.\nThe agreements that govern our senior secured credit facility and the indentures that govern our second lien senior secured notes, contain a number of covenants that limit the discretion of our management with respect to certain business matters and may impair our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions. The senior secured credit facility and the indentures, among other things, restrict our ability to:\n\u2022 incur additional debt or issue guarantees of debt;\n\u2022 sell preferred stock;\n\u2022 create liens;\n\u2022 make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends or the repurchase of our common stock);\n\u2022 make certain types of investments;\n\u2022 sell stock in our restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022 pay dividends or make payments from subsidiaries;\n\u2022 enter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022 sell all or substantially all of our assets or merge or consolidate with another company.\nIf we fail to comply with the financial covenants or the other restrictions contained in our senior secured credit facility or the indentures that govern our second lien senior secured notes, an event of default would occur. An event of default could result in the acceleration of our debt due to the cross-default provisions within our debt agreements. If the debt is accelerated, we would not have, and may not be able to obtain, sufficient funds to repay our debt, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreases in the price of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor or their reduced availability could increase our cost of goods and negatively impact our financial results.\nFluctuations in the price and availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor have not materially affected our cost of goods in recent years, but an inability to mitigate these cost increases, unless sufficiently offset with retail pricing adjustments, might cause a decrease in our profitability. Related retail pricing adjustments, however, might cause a decline in our sales volume. Additionally, any decrease in the availability of raw materials could impair our ability to meet our purchasing requirements in a timely manner. Both the increased cost and lower availability of merchandise, raw materials, fuel and labor may also have an adverse impact on our cash and working capital needs as well as those of our suppliers.\nFailure to maintain key vendor and factor relationships may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent to a significant degree upon close relationships with our vendors and their factors and our ability to purchase brand name merchandise at competitive prices and terms. The loss of key vendor and factor support could have a material adverse effect on our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire brand name merchandise at competitive prices or on competitive terms in the future. Additionally, certain merchandise may be allocated by vendors based upon the vendors' internal distribution strategy, which is beyond our control. In addition, if our vendors are unable to access liquidity or become insolvent, they could be unable to supply us with product or\ncontinue with their support of our advertising and promotional programs. Any such disruptions could negatively impact our ability to acquire merchandise or obtain vendor allowances in support of our advertising and promotional programs, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in the terms of our private label credit card program could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nOur private label credit card program is operated, under agreement, by ADS. ADS issues our private label credit cards to our customers and we receive a percentage of the net credit sales and outstanding credit balances thereunder. ADS may be unable or unwilling to provide support for our private label credit card program under similar terms or conditions as exist today or our agreement with ADS may be terminated under circumstances in which we are unable to quickly and adequately contract with a comparable replacement vendor causing our customers, who have accounts under our private label credit card program, to not be able to use their cards. Either of these cases would likely result in a decrease in sales, a loss of the revenues attributable to the payments from ADS and an adverse effect on customer goodwill, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe might not be able to successfully implement our business strategies.\nWe have identified strategies to achieve sales growth and improve our financial performance in the years ahead, such as strategies with regard to merchandising, marketing and customer service. These strategies are described in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis-2017 Strategies and Guidance\" and in other communications, including our Chief Executive Officer's letter to our shareholders. If we are unable to successfully execute those strategies, our operating results may suffer. Even if we are able to successfully execute our strategies, there can be no assurance that these strategies will necessarily result in our improved financial performance. In addition, the employment of any new approach involves risks and potential increased costs that may prove to be detrimental to our operating results.\nInsufficient or ineffective allocation of capital could adversely impact operations and our operating results.\nWe depend on cash flow from operations and supplemental borrowings under our credit facility to fund capital spending. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows to support our capital needs or if sufficient financing is not available, we may not be able to allocate required capital to remodeling and maintenance of existing stores, the opening of new stores and other capital projects.\nWe might not be able to develop and maintain a robust omnichannel business and it may operate at a margin lower than our stores.\nOne of our strategic initiatives is to further our omnichannel capabilities to coalesce our efforts in stores, online and mobile as we look to engage our customers at all touch points. Omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must anticipate and meet changing customer expectations. Our omnichannel initiatives include our \"Let Us Find It\" and \"Buy Online Pick Up In-Store\" programs. In addition, we continue to explore ways to enhance our customers' omnichannel shopping experience. These initiatives involve significant investments in technology and significant operational changes. In addition, our competitors are also investing in omnichannel initiatives, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives. If the implementation of our omnichannel initiatives is not successful or does not meet customer expectations, we may not realize a return on our omnichannel investments and our reputation and operating results may be adversely affected.\nOver the past several years, our omnichannel sales have increased significantly, but generate a lower margin than do our stores-only sales. This difference in profitability is due to a number of factors within our omnichannel business, including the cost to ship merchandise to customers and the\ncompetitive pressures to offer free or reduced shipping on many orders, and the significant cost to provide and maintain the infrastructure and systems necessary to operate our omnichannel business. There is no assurance that, in light of these factors, our omnichannel business can be operated at profitability levels historically seen in stores sales.\nA shutdown or disruption of operations in our distribution or fulfillment centers would have an adverse effect on the Company's business and operations.\nAlthough we believe that we have appropriate contingency plans, including fulfillment of omnichannel orders through stores and the ability of any of our distribution centers to service additional stores, unforeseen disruptions in operations at our distribution or fulfillment centers due to fire, weather or natural disasters or other events, may result in the loss of inventory, delays in fulfilling online orders and disruption of the supply of goods to stores, which would adversely impact our sales.\nOur business could be significantly disrupted if we cannot retain or replace members of our management team.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our executive officers and other key personnel, both individually and as a group. Our future performance will be substantially dependent on our ability to retain or replace our executive officers and key personnel and our inability to retain or replace our executive officers and key personnel could prevent us from executing our business strategy.\nWe may face increased costs in attracting and retaining quality associates.\nOur business is dependent upon attracting and retaining quality associates. As is common with most retailers, a significant number of our associates are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. In addition, our staffing needs are highest during the holiday season when competition for these associates is intense. We must continue to meet our labor needs while controlling labor and benefit (including healthcare) costs. These costs are subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, Federal, state and local minimum wage legislation, health reform legislation, changing demographics and changes in Federal overtime pay rules. Any of these factors could increase our employment costs and could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur business could be significantly disrupted and burdened with additional costs if our associates unionize.\nWhile we believe our relationship with our associates is good, we cannot be assured that we will not become the subject of a unionization campaign. If some or all of our workforce were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements or work practices, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur pension costs could increase at a higher than anticipated rate.\nSignificant decreases in the fair value of plan assets, investment losses on plan assets and changes in interest rates have affected and could further affect the funded status of our plans and could increase future funding requirements of the pension plans. A significant increase in future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to accurately predict customer-based trends and effectively manage our inventory levels, which could reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIt is difficult to predict what and how much merchandise consumers will want. A substantial part of our business is dependent upon our ability to make correct trend decisions. Failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes, spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions, particularly given the long lead times for ordering much of our merchandise, could adversely affect our long-term relationships with our customers. We focus on inventory levels and balance these levels with inventory plans and reviews of trends; however, if our inventories become too large, we may have to \"mark down\" or decrease our sales prices, and we may be required to sell a significant amount of unsold inventory at discounted prices or even below cost.\nAn inability to find qualified domestic and international vendors who will provide merchandise at a reasonable cost could adversely affect our business.\nThe products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. The availability of products and the ultimate costs of buying and selling these products, including advertising and promotional costs, are not completely within our control and could increase our merchandise and operating costs. Additionally, costs and other factors specific to imported merchandise, such as trade restrictions, taxes, tariffs, currency exchange rates and transport capacity and costs, are beyond our control and could restrict the availability of imported merchandise or significantly increase the costs of our merchandise and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConditions in, and the United States' relationship with, the countries where we source our merchandise could adversely affect our business.\nA majority of our merchandise is manufactured outside of the United States. Political instability or other events resulting in the disruption of trade from the countries where our merchandise is manufactured or the imposition of additional regulations relating to, or duties upon, the merchandise we import could cause significant delays or interruptions in the supply of our merchandise or increase our costs. If we are forced to source merchandise from other countries, those goods may be more expensive than, or of inferior quality to, the merchandise we now sell. If we are unable to adequately replace the merchandise we currently source with merchandise produced elsewhere, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business is seasonal.\nOur business is subject to seasonal influences, with a major portion of sales and income historically realized during the second half of the fiscal year, which includes the holiday season. This seasonality causes our operating results to vary considerably from quarter to quarter and could have a material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. We must carry a significant amount of inventory, especially before the peak selling periods. If we are not successful in selling our inventory, especially during our peak selling periods, we may be forced to rely on markdowns, vendor support or promotional sales to dispose of the inventory or we may not be able to sell the inventory at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWeather conditions could adversely affect our results of operations.\nBecause a significant portion of our business is apparel sales and subject to weather conditions in our markets, our operating results may be unexpectedly and adversely affected by inclement weather. Frequent or unusually heavy snow, ice or rain storms might make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores or, in particularly adverse conditions, our stores might be subject to temporary closings,\nthereby reducing our sales and profitability. Extended periods of unseasonable temperatures in our markets, such as unusually warm weather during the holiday season, could render a portion of our inventory incompatible with those unseasonable conditions, reduce sales and adversely affect our business.\nThe ownership and leasing of significant amounts of real estate expose us to possible liabilities.\nWe currently own or lease 262 stores, which subjects us to the risks associated with owning and leasing real estate. In particular, because of changes in the investment climate for real estate, the value of a property could decrease or operating costs could increase. Our store leases generally require us to pay a fixed minimum rent and a variable amount based on a percentage of sales at that location. These leases generally do not allow for termination prior to the end of the lease term without economic consequences. If a store is not profitable and we make the decision to close it, we may remain committed to perform certain obligations under the lease, including the payment of rent, for the balance of the lease term. In addition, as each of the leases expires, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations. If an existing owned store is not profitable, we may be required to record an impairment charge and/or exit costs if we make a decision to close that store. In addition, lease or other obligations may restrict our right to cease operations of an unprofitable owned or leased store, which may cause us to continue to operate the location at a loss. A decline in real estate values could also have an adverse effect on our borrowing availability under our senior secured credit facility.\nRisks associated with our private brands could adversely affect our business.\nWe offer our customers quality products at competitive prices marketed under our private brands. We expect to continue to grow our private label offerings and have invested in our development and procurement resources and marketing efforts related to these exclusive brand offerings. The expansion of our private brand offerings subjects us to certain additional risks. These include, among others, risks related to: our failure to comply with government and industry safety standards; mandatory or voluntary product recalls related to our private brand offerings; our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights in our exclusive offerings; and risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing. In addition, damage to the reputation of our private brand trade names may generate negative customer sentiment. Our failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nNew legal requirements could make our business operations more costly.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by new legal requirements, including the Affordable Care Act and any replacement or modification thereof, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and potential legislation or regulations such as global and domestic greenhouse gas emission requirements and increased state or federal minimum wage requirements. The financial impact of these new legal requirements cannot be determined with certainty. New laws or regulations may result in increased direct costs to us for compliance or may cause our vendors to raise prices to us because of increased compliance costs or reduced availability of raw materials.\nAn unfavorable outcome to a potential litigation claim could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions. We are impacted by trends in litigation, including, but not limited to, intellectual property matters and class-action allegations brought under various consumer protection and employment laws. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the\nultimate outcome of any such proceeding. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, regardless of the outcome of any litigation or regulatory proceeding, claims brought against us could result in substantial costs and may require that we devote substantial resources to our defense.\nFailure to successfully maintain and update information technology systems and enhance existing systems may adversely affect our business.\nTo keep pace with changing technology, we must continuously provide for the design and implementation of new information technology systems and enhancements of our existing systems. Any failure to adequately maintain and update the information technology systems supporting our sales operations, website, mobile application or inventory control could prevent us from processing and delivering merchandise, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOperational disruptions in our information systems may adversely affect our business.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information systems. We rely on our information systems to manage sales, distribution, merchandise planning and allocation functions. We also generate sales through the operations of our website and mobile application. If our systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim. Any material interruption in our computer operations may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.\nA security breach that results in the unauthorized disclosure of customer, employee or Company information could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial condition.\nThe protection of customer, employee and Company data is critical to us. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements. These new and changing requirements could impose significant costs on our business. In addition, customers have an expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information. Although we believe we have appropriate security measures in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, could be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Recent retail industry data breaches highlight the risks and costs of these threats. A significant breach of customer, employee or Company data could damage our reputation and affect our business operations and result in lost sales, fines, lawsuits, government investigations or enforcement actions as well as significant legal and professional services costs.\nWe are subject to customer payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations.\nAs a retailer who accepts payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, and gift cards, we are subject to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems.\nThe regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs or accelerate these costs. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which could increase over time and\nraise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could disrupt our business.\nIf our marketing programs are not successful, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur business depends on attracting an adequate volume of customers who are likely to purchase our merchandise. We design our marketing programs to increase awareness of our stores and our brands, which we expect will create and maintain customer loyalty, increase the number of customers that shop our stores and increase our sales. We have a significant number of marketing initiatives which we regularly review and revise as necessary. There can be no assurance as to our continued ability to effectively execute our advertising and marketing programs, and any failure to do so could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nUse of social media may adversely impact our reputation or subject us to fines or other penalties.\nThere has been a substantial increase in the use of social media platforms, including blogs, social media websites and other forms of internet-based communications, which allow individual's access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Consumers value readily available information concerning retailers and their goods and services and often act on such information without further investigation and without regard to its accuracy. Information concerning us may be posted on social media platforms at any time and may be adverse to our reputation or business. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. Damage to our reputation could result in declines in customer loyalty and sales, affect our vendor relationships, development opportunities and associate retention and otherwise adversely affect our business.\nAs laws and regulations rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices, the failure by us, our associates or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our reputation or subject us to fines or other penalties.\nTim Grumbacher has voting control over matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders, and he may take actions that conflict with the interests of our other shareholders and holders of our debt securities.\nCollectively, Tim Grumbacher, trusts for the benefit of Mr. Grumbacher's grandchildren and The Grumbacher Family Foundation beneficially own shares of our outstanding common stock (which is entitled to one vote per share) and shares of our Class A common stock (which is entitled to ten votes per share) representing, in the aggregate, more than 50% of the votes eligible to be cast by shareholders in the election of directors and generally. Accordingly, Mr. Grumbacher has the power to control all matters requiring the approval of our shareholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions. The interests of Mr. Grumbacher and certain other shareholders may conflict with the interests of our other shareholders and holders of our debt securities.\nIn addition to Mr. Grumbacher's voting control, certain provisions of our charter documents and Pennsylvania law could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could deter, delay or prevent a change in control of the Company that our other shareholders consider favorable and could depress the market value of our common stock.\nCertain provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws, as well as provisions of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law, could have the effect of deterring takeovers or delaying or\npreventing changes in control or management of the Company that our shareholders consider favorable and could depress the market value of our common stock.\nSubchapter F of Chapter 25 of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988, which is applicable to us, may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider in his or her best interest. In general, Subchapter F could delay for five years and impose conditions upon \"business combinations\" between an \"interested shareholder\" and us, unless prior approval by our Board of Directors is given. The term \"business combination\" is defined broadly to include various merger, consolidation, division, exchange or sale transactions, including transactions using our assets for refinancing purposes. An \"interested shareholder,\" in general, would be a beneficial owner of shares entitling that person to cast at least 20% of the votes that all shareholders would be entitled to cast in an election of directors.\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and may be significantly affected by:\n\u2022 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022 announcements of new services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 our level of indebtedness and our ability to refinance and service our debt;\n\u2022 developments with respect to conditions and trends in our industry;\n\u2022 governmental regulation;\n\u2022 general market conditions, particularly periods of decline;\n\u2022 changes in general economic conditions; and\n\u2022 other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nNatural disasters, war, acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts and public health issues may adversely impact our business.\nThe occurrence of, or threat of, a natural disaster, war, acts of terrorism, other armed conflicts and public health issues could disrupt our operations, disrupt international trade and supply chain efficiencies, suppliers or customers or result in political or economic instability. If commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed our business may be adversely impacted, as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers, fulfillment centers, stores or directly to customers. As a result of the occurrence of, or threat of, a natural disaster or acts of terrorism in the United States, we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our stores, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 76847, "SIC": 5311, "TIC": "BONTQ"}
