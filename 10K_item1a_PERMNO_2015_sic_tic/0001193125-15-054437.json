{"cik": "1517228", "company": "CommScope Holding Company, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following is a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that we believe are significant to our business. In addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following are some of the important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make our results differ materially from those described in any forward-looking statements. It is impossible to predict or identify all such factors and, as a result, you should not consider the following factors to be a complete discussion of risks, uncertainties and assumptions.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur business is dependent on capital spending on data and communication networks by customers or end users of our products and reductions in such capital spending adversely affect our business.\nOur performance is dependent on customers\u2019 or end users\u2019 capital spending for constructing, rebuilding, maintaining or upgrading data and communication networks, which can be volatile or hard to forecast. Capital spending in the communications industry is cyclical and can be curtailed or deferred on short notice. A variety of factors affect the amount of capital spending, and, therefore, our sales and profits, including:\n\u2022\ncompeting technologies;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\ntiming and adoption of global rollout of new technologies, including 4G/LTE;\n\u2022\ncustomer specific financial or stock market conditions;\n\u2022\navailability and cost of capital;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulation;\n\u2022\ndemands for network services;\n\u2022\ncompetitive pressures, including pricing pressures;\n\u2022\nacceptance of new services offered by our customers;\n\u2022\nimpact of industry consolidation; and\n\u2022\nreal or perceived trends or uncertainties in these factors.\nSeveral of our customers or end users of our products have accumulated significant levels of debt. These high debt levels, coupled with uncertainty in the capital markets, may impact their access to capital in the future. Even if the financial health of our customers or end users of our products remains intact, these customers or end users of our products may not purchase new equipment at levels we have seen in the past or expect in the future. If our product portfolio and product development plans do not position us well to capture an increased portion of the capital spending of customers or end users of our products in the markets on which we focus, our revenue may decline.\nAs a result of these issues, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenue in the future, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nA substantial portion of our business is derived from a limited number of key customers or distributors.\nWe derived 22% of our 2014 consolidated net sales from our top three direct customers or distributors. Our largest distributor, Anixter, accounted for 11% of our 2014 consolidated net sales. The concentration of our net sales among these and other key customers or distributors subjects us to a variety of risks that could have a material adverse impact on our net sales and profitability, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nlower sales resulting from the loss of one or more of our key customers or distributors;\n\u2022\nrenegotiations of agreements with key customers or distributors resulting in materially less favorable terms;\n\u2022\nfinancial difficulties experienced by one or more of our key customers, distributors or our distributors\u2019 end customers, resulting in reduced purchases of our products and/or uncollectible accounts receivable balances;\n\u2022\nreductions in inventory levels held by distributors and OEMs which may be unrelated to purchasing trends by the ultimate customer;\n\u2022\nconsolidations in the wireless or cable television industries resulting in delays in purchasing decisions or reduced purchases by the merged businesses;\n\u2022\nnew or proposed laws or regulations affecting the telecommunications, wireless or cable television industries resulting in reduced capital spending;\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of borrowing or capital and/or reductions in the amount of debt or equity capital available to the telecommunications, wireless or cable television industries resulting in reduced capital spending; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the technology deployed by customers resulting in lower sales of our products.\nAdditionally, the risks above are further increased as a result of our indirect sales to end users of our products, including those who may also be direct customers. In addition, we generally have no minimum purchase commitments from any of our distributors, system integrators, value-added resellers, OEMs, or other customers, and our contracts with these parties do not prohibit them from purchasing or offering products or services that compete with ours. Although we maintain long-term relationships with these parties and have not historically lost key customers, we have experienced variability in the level of purchases by our key customers and end users of our products, and any significant reduction in sales to these customers and end users of our products, including as a result of their inability or unwillingness to continue purchasing our products, or their failure to properly manage their businesses with respect to the purchase of and payment for our products, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur future success depends on our ability to anticipate and to adapt to technological changes and develop, implement and market product innovations.\nMany of our markets are characterized by advances in information processing and communications capabilities that require increased transmission speeds and greater bandwidth. These advances require ongoing improvements in the capabilities of our products.\nHowever, we may not be successful in our ongoing improvement efforts if, among other things, our products:\n\u2022\nare not cost effective;\n\u2022\nare not brought to market in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nare not in accordance with evolving industry standards;\n\u2022\nfail to achieve market acceptance or meet customer requirements; or\n\u2022\nare ahead of the needs of their markets.\nThere are various competitive wireless technologies that could be a potential substitute for some of the communications products we sell. Fiber optic technology presents a potential substitute for some of the broadband communications cable products we sell. A significant decrease in the cost of deploying fiber optic systems could make these systems superior on a price/performance basis to copper or aluminum systems and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn order to successfully develop and market certain of our planned products, we may be required to enter into technology development or licensing agreements with third parties. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to timely enter into any necessary technology development or licensing agreements on reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe failure to successfully introduce new or enhanced products on a timely and cost-competitive basis or the inability to continue to market existing products on a cost-competitive basis could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, sales of new products may replace sales of some of our existing products, mitigating the benefits of new product introductions and possibly resulting in excess levels of inventory.\nOur revenues are dependent on the commercial deployment of technologies based on time division multiple access, or \u201cTDMA\u201d, code division multiple access, or \u201cCDMA,\u201d and orthogonal frequency-division multiple access, or \u201cOFDMA,\u201d among others, and upgrades of 2G, 3G and 4G wireless communications equipment, products and services based on these technologies.\nWe develop, patent and commercialize technology and products based on TDMA, CDMA and OFDMA, among others. Our revenues are dependent upon the commercial deployment of these technologies and products and upgrades of 2G, 3G and 4G wireless communications equipment, products and services based on these technologies. For example, several wireless providers in the United States have announced plans to shut down legacy TDMA and CDMA networks. While we believe the deployment and adoption of LTE technology will help reduce the effect of this industry trend, our business may be harmed, and our investments in these technologies may not provide us an adequate return if:\n\u2022\nLTE, an OFDMA-based wireless standard, is not widely deployed or commercial deployment is delayed;\n\u2022\nwireless operators delay moving 2G customers to 3G and 4G devices;\n\u2022\nwireless operators delay 3G and/or 4G deployments, expansions or upgrades;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulators delay the reallocation of spectrum to allow wireless operators to upgrade to 3G and 4G, which will restrict the expansion of 3G and 4G wireless connectivity, primarily outside of major population areas;\n\u2022\nwireless operators are unable to drive improvements in 3G and 4G network performance and/or capacity;\n\u2022\nwireless operators and other industries using these technologies deploy other technologies; or\n\u2022\nwireless operators choose to spend their capital on their core network or limit their expenditures on radio access network (RAN).\nOur business is dependent on our ability to increase our share of components sold and to continue to drive the adoption of our products and services into 3G and 4G wireless networks. We are also dependent on the success of our customers, licensees and TDMA-, CDMA- and OFDMA-based wireless operators and other industries using our technologies, as well as the timing of their deployment of new services. They may incur lower gross margins on products or services based on these technologies than on products using alternative technologies as a result of greater competition or other factors. If commercial deployment of these technologies, upgrade of 2G subscribers to 3G devices and upgrades to 3G or 4G wireless communications equipment, products and services based on these technologies do not continue or are delayed, our revenues could be negatively impacted, and our business could suffer.\nWe may not fully realize anticipated benefits from past or future acquisitions or equity investments.\nWe anticipate that a portion of any future growth of our business might be accomplished by acquiring existing businesses, products or technologies. The success of any acquisition will depend upon, among other things, our ability to integrate acquired personnel, operations, products and technologies into our organization effectively, to retain and motivate key personnel of acquired businesses and to retain their customers. In addition, we might not be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities or obtain any necessary financing on acceptable terms. We might also spend time and money investigating and negotiating with potential acquisition or investment targets, but not complete the transaction.\nAlthough we expect to realize strategic, operational and financial benefits as a result of our past or future acquisitions and equity investments, we cannot predict whether and to what extent such benefits will be achieved. There are significant challenges to integrating an acquired operation into our business, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully managing the operations, manufacturing facilities and technology;\n\u2022\nintegrating the sales organizations and maintaining and increasing the customer base;\n\u2022\nretaining key employees, suppliers and distributors;\n\u2022\nintegrating management information, inventory, accounting and research and development activities; and\n\u2022\naddressing operating losses related to individual facilities or product lines.\nAny future acquisition could involve other risks, including the assumption of additional liabilities and expenses, issuances of debt, transaction costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, and such acquisition may be dilutive to our financial results. See \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Related to the Acquisition\u201d.\nWe face competitive pressures with respect to all of our major products.\nIn each of our major product groups, we compete with a substantial number of foreign and domestic companies, some of which have greater resources (financial or otherwise) or lower operating costs than we have. Competitors\u2019 actions, such as price reductions or introduction of new innovative products, and the use of exclusively price driven Internet auctions by customers may have a material adverse impact on our net sales and profitability. In addition, the rapid technological changes occurring in the communications industry could lead to the entry of new competitors. We cannot assure you that we will continue to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors.\nMany of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, and have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have. Many of these large enterprises are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by customers in our markets. They often have broader product lines and market focus, and may not be as susceptible to downturns in a single market. These competitors may also be able to bundle their products together to meet the needs of a particular customer, and may be capable of delivering more complete solutions than we are able to provide. To the extent large enterprises that currently do not compete directly with us choose to enter our markets by acquisition or otherwise, competition would likely intensify.\nFurther, some of our competitors that have greater financial resources have offered, and in the future may offer, their products at lower prices than we offer for our competing products or on more attractive financing or payment terms, which has in the past caused, and may in the future cause, us to lose sales opportunities and the resulting revenue or to reduce our prices in response to that competition. Reductions in prices for any of our products could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating margins. In addition, many of our competitors have been in operation longer than we have and, therefore, have more long-standing and established relationships with domestic and foreign customers, making it difficult for us to sell to those customers.\nIf any of our competitors\u2019 products or technologies were to become the industry standard, our business would be seriously harmed. If our competitors are successful in bringing their products to market earlier than we can, or if their products are more technologically capable than ours, our revenue could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, certain companies that have not had a large presence in the broadband communications equipment market have begun to expand their presence in this market through mergers and acquisitions. The continued consolidation of our competitors could have a significant negative impact on our business. Further, our competitors may bundle their products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products or which may require us to lower our selling prices, resulting in lower revenue and decreased gross margins.\nIf we are unable to compete at the same level as we have in the past, in any of our markets, or are forced to reduce the prices of our products in order to continue to be competitive, our operating results, financial condition and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe depend on channel partners to sell our products in certain markets and regions and are subject to risks associated with these arrangements.\nWe utilize distributors, system integrators and value-added resellers (collectively, channel partners) to sell our products to certain end customers and in certain geographic regions to improve our access to these customers and regions and to lower our overall cost of post-sales support. For the year ended December 31, 2014, sales to our four largest channel partners represented 19% of our net sales. Our sales through channel partners are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe ability of our selected channel partners to effectively sell our products to end customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to continue channel partner arrangements into the future because most are for a limited term and subject to mutual agreement to extend;\n\u2022\na reduction in gross margins realized on sale of our products; and\n\u2022\na diminution of contact with end customers which, over time, could adversely impact our ability to develop new products that meet customers\u2019 evolving requirements.\nIn the past, we have seen some channel partners acquired and consolidated. If there were further consolidation of our channel partners, this could affect our relationships with these channel partners. It could also result in consolidation of channel partner inventory, which could temporarily depress our revenue. In addition, changes in the inventory levels of our products held by our channel partners can result in significant variability in our revenues. The financial failure of a channel partner could result in our inability to collect accounts receivable in full. A global economic downturn could cause financial difficulties (including bankruptcy) for our channel partners and customers, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe generally have no minimum purchase commitments from any of our channel partners or OEM customers, and our contracts with these parties do not prohibit them from purchasing or offering products or services that compete with ours. Our competitors may provide incentives to any of our channel partners or OEM customers to favor their products or, in effect, to prevent or reduce sales of our products. Any of our channel partners or OEM customers may independently choose not to purchase or offer our products. Many of our channel partners are small and may have relatively unsophisticated processes and limited financial resources to conduct their business. Any significant disruption of our sales to these customers, including as a result of the inability or unwillingness of these customers to continue purchasing our products, or their failure to properly manage their businesses with respect to the purchase of and payment for our products, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, our failure to continue to establish or maintain successful relationships with channel partners or OEM customers could likewise materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf contract manufacturers that we rely on encounter production, quality, financial or other difficulties, we may experience difficulty in meeting customer demands.\nWe rely on unaffiliated contract manufacturers, both domestically and internationally, to produce certain products or key components of products. If we are unable to arrange for sufficient production capacity among our contract manufacturers or if our contract manufacturers encounter production, quality, financial or other difficulties, including labor disturbances or geopolitical risks, and if alternative suppliers cannot be identified, we may encounter difficulty in meeting customer demands. Any such difficulties could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and results of operations, which could be material.\nIf our integrated global manufacturing operations suffer production or shipping delays, we may experience difficulty in meeting customer demands.\nWe internally produce, both domestically and internationally, a portion of certain components used in our finished products. Disruption of our ability to produce at or distribute from these facilities due to failure of our manufacturing infrastructure, information technology outage, fire, electrical outage, natural disaster, acts of terrorism, shipping interruptions or some other catastrophic event could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture products at our other manufacturing facilities in a cost-effective and timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we encounter capacity constraints with respect to our internal facilities and/or existing or new contract manufacturers, it could have an adverse impact on our business.\nIf we do not have sufficient production capacity, either through our internal facilities and/or through independent contract manufacturers, to meet customer demand for our products, we may experience lost sales opportunities and customer relations problems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on effective information management systems.\nWe rely on our enterprise resource planning systems to support such critical business operations as processing sales orders and invoicing; manufacturing; shipping; inventory control; purchasing and supply chain management; human resources; and financial reporting. If we are unable to successfully implement major systems initiatives and maintain critical information systems, we could encounter difficulties that could have a material adverse impact on our business, internal controls over financial reporting, or our ability to timely and accurately report our financial results.\nCyber-security incidents, including data security breaches or computer viruses, could harm our business by exposing us to various liabilities, disrupting our delivery of products and services and damaging our reputation.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems to operate our business. We receive, process, store and transmit, often electronically, the confidential data of the Company and our customers, vendors, employees and others. Despite implemented security measures, our facilities, systems and procedures, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, software viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. In particular, unauthorized access to our computer systems or stored data could result in the theft or improper disclosure of confidential or sensitive information, the deletion or modification of records or interruptions in our operations. Any such events, including those involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential or sensitive information of the Company or our customers, vendors, employees or others, whether by us or a third party, could (i) subject us to civil and criminal penalties, (ii) expose us to liabilities to our customers, employees, vendors, third parties or governmental authorities, (iii) disrupt our delivery of products and services, or (iv) have a negative impact on our reputation. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our products, including material purchased from our suppliers, experience quality or performance issues, our business may suffer.\nOur business depends on delivering products of consistently high quality. To this end, our products are tested for quality both by us and our customers. Nevertheless, many of our products are highly complex and testing procedures used by us and our customers are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios. For various reasons (including, among others, the occurrence of performance problems unforeseeable in testing), our products (including components and raw materials purchased from our suppliers and completed goods purchased for resale) may fail to perform as expected. Performance issues could result from faulty design or problems in manufacturing. We have experienced such performance issues in the past and remain exposed to such performance issues. In some cases, recall of some or all affected products, product redesigns or additional capital expenditures may be required to correct a defect. In addition, we generally offer warranties on most products, the terms and conditions of which depend upon the product subject to the warranty. In some cases, we indemnify our customers against damages or losses that might arise from certain claims relating to our products. Future claims may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any significant or systemic product failure could also result in lost future sales of the affected product and other products, as well as reputational damage.\nOur significant international operations expose us to economic, political and other risks.\nWe have significant international sales, manufacturing and distribution operations. We have major international manufacturing and/or distribution facilities in, among others, Australia, China, the Czech Republic, Germany, India, Ireland, Mexico, Singapore and the United Kingdom. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, international sales represented approximately 45%, 45% and 47%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. In general, our international sales have lower margins than our domestic sales. To the extent international sales represent a greater percentage of our revenue, our overall margin may decline.\nOur international sales, manufacturing and distribution operations are subject to the risks inherent in operating abroad, including, but not limited to, risks with respect to currency exchange rates; economic and political destabilization; restrictive actions by foreign governments; wage inflation; nationalizations; the laws and policies of the United States affecting trade, exports, imports, anti-bribery, foreign investment and loans; foreign tax laws, including the ability to recover amounts paid as value-added taxes; potential restrictions on the repatriation of cash; reduced protection of intellectual property; longer customer payment cycles; compliance with local laws and regulations; armed conflict; terrorism; shipping interruptions; and major health concerns (such as infectious diseases).\nRisks related to foreign currency rates can impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. We manage these risks through regular operating and financing activities and periodically use derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward and option contracts. There can be no assurance that our risk management strategies will be effective or that the counterparties to our derivative contracts will be able to perform. In addition, foreign currency rates in many of the countries in which we operate have at times been extremely volatile and unpredictable. We may choose not to hedge or determine that we are unable to effectively hedge the risks associated with this volatility. In such cases, we may experience declines in revenue and adverse impacts on earnings and such changes could be material.\nOur international operations require us to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions.\nDoing business on a worldwide basis requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various international jurisdictions, and our failure to comply with these rules and regulations may expose us to liabilities. These laws and regulations may apply to companies, individual directors, officers, employees and agents, and may restrict our operations, trade practices, investment decisions and partnering activities. In\nparticular, our international operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The FCPA prohibits U.S. companies and their officers, directors, employees and agents acting on their behalf from improperly offering, promising, authorizing or providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of influencing official decisions or obtaining or retaining business or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA also requires companies to keep books, records and accounts that accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets and to maintain a system of adequate internal accounting controls. As part of our business, we deal with state-owned business enterprises, the employees and representatives of which may be considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA. We are also subject to the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act, which prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both public and private sectors. In addition, some of the international locations in which we operate lack a developed legal system and have elevated levels of corruption. As a result of the above activities, we are exposed to the risk of violating anti-corruption laws. Violations of these legal requirements are punishable by criminal fines and imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, debarment from government contracts as well as other remedial measures. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist us and our personnel in complying with applicable U.S. and international laws and regulations. However, our employees, subcontractors and agents could take actions that violate these requirements, which could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations and such effects could be material.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nCertain of our products are subject to export controls and may be exported only with the required export license or through an export license exception. If we were to fail to comply with export licensing, customs regulations, economic sanctions and other laws, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including fines for us and incarceration for responsible employees and managers, and the possible loss of export or import privileges. In addition, if our distributors fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected through reputational harm and penalties. Obtaining the necessary export license for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Furthermore, export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products to embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons. While we train our employees to comply with these regulations, we cannot assure that a violation will not occur, whether knowingly or inadvertently. Any such shipment could have negative consequences including government investigations, penalties, fines, civil and criminal sanctions, and reputational harm. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and such effects could be material.\nWe may sell one or more of our product lines, as a result of our evaluation of our products and markets, and any such divestiture could adversely affect our expenses, revenues, results of operation, cash flows and financial position.\nWe periodically evaluate our various product lines and may, as a result, consider the divestiture of one or more of those product lines. Any such divestiture could adversely affect our expenses, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nDivestitures of product lines have inherent risks, including the expense of selling the product line, the possibility that any anticipated sale will not occur, possible delays in closing any sale, the risk of lower-than-expected proceeds from the sale of the divested business, unexpected costs associated with the separation of the business to be sold from our information technology and other operating systems, and potential post-closing claims for indemnification. Expected cost savings, which are offset by revenue losses from divested businesses, may also be\ndifficult to achieve or maximize due to a fixed cost structure, and we may experience varying success in reducing fixed costs or transferring liabilities previously associated with the divested business.\nDifficulties may be encountered in the realignment of manufacturing capacity and capabilities among our global manufacturing facilities that could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demands for our products.\nWe periodically realign manufacturing capacity among our global facilities in order to reduce costs by improving manufacturing efficiency and to strengthen our long-term competitive position. The implementation of these initiatives may include significant shifts of production capacity among facilities.\nThere are significant risks inherent in the implementation of these initiatives, including, but not limited to, failing to ensure that: there is adequate inventory on hand or production capacity to meet customer demand while capacity is being shifted among facilities; there is no decrease in product quality as a result of shifting capacity; adequate raw material and other service providers are available to meet the needs at the new production locations; equipment can be successfully removed, transported and re-installed; and adequate supervisory, production and support personnel are available to accommodate the shifted production.\nIn the event that manufacturing realignment initiatives are not successfully implemented, we could experience lost future sales and increased operating costs as well as customer relations problems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need to undertake additional restructuring actions in the future.\nWe have previously recognized restructuring charges in response to slowdowns in demand for our products and in conjunction with implementation of initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiency of our operations. Recent actions have included the sale of certain assets of our BiMetals\u00ae business and the closure of manufacturing facilities in Statesville, North Carolina; Joliet, Illinois; and Guangzhou, China. Much of the production capacity from these facilities was shifted to other existing facilities or contract manufacturers. Additional restructuring actions were initiated to realign and lower our cost structure primarily through workforce reductions at various U.S. and international facilities. As a result of changes in business conditions and other developments, we may need to initiate additional restructuring actions that could result in workforce reductions and restructuring charges, which could be material.\nWe may need to recognize additional impairment charges related to goodwill, identified intangible assets and fixed assets.\nWe have substantial balances of goodwill and identified intangible assets. We are required to test goodwill for possible impairment on the same date each year and on an interim basis if there are indicators of a possible impairment. We are also required to evaluate amortizable intangible assets and fixed assets for impairment if there are indicators of a possible impairment.\nThere is significant judgment required in the analysis of a potential impairment of goodwill, identified intangible assets and fixed assets. If, as a result of a general economic slowdown, deterioration in one or more of the markets in which we operate or in our financial performance and/or future outlook, the estimated fair value of our long-lived assets decreases, we may determine that one or more of our long-lived assets is impaired. An impairment charge would be determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets and any such impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have obligations under our defined benefit employee benefit plans and may be required to make plan contributions in excess of current estimates.\nAt December 31, 2014, the net liability for pension and other postretirement benefits was $29.8 million (benefit obligation of $339.0 million and plan assets of $309.2 million). See Note 10 to Consolidated Financial\nStatements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Significant declines in the assets and/or increases in the liabilities related to these obligations as a result of changes in actuarial estimates, asset performance, interest rates or benefit changes, among others, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and/or results of operations.\nWe continue to fund a material portion of our underfunded pension obligations in the U.S. under the terms of an agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), that we entered into in connection with the 2011 closure of our Omaha production facility. The terms of the agreement with the PBGC require funding through 2015. We have similar exposures with respect to certain pension plans outside the U.S. Foreign plans represented 46% and 48% of our pension benefit obligation and pension plans\u2019 assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2014. The amounts and timing of the remaining contributions we expect to make to our defined benefit plans reflect a number of actuarial and other estimates and assumptions with respect to our expected plan funding obligations. The actual amounts and timing of these contributions will depend upon a number of factors and the actual amounts and timing of our future plan funding contributions may differ materially from those presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we elect to terminate one or more of these plans and settle the obligation through the purchase of one or more annuities, we could incur a charge and/or make additional contributions and such amounts could be material.\nOur financial condition may be adversely affected to the extent that we are required to make contributions to any of our defined benefit plans in excess of the amounts assumed in our current projections.\nWe may incur costs and may not be successful in protecting our intellectual property and in defending claims that we are infringing the intellectual property of others.\nWe may encounter difficulties and significant costs in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property to permit us to continue or expand our business. Other companies, including some of our largest competitors, hold intellectual property rights in our industry and the intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products unless we secure necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms.\nIn addition, we have been required and may be required in the future to initiate litigation in order to enforce patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and/or validity of a third party\u2019s patent or other proprietary rights. We also have been and may in the future be subject to lawsuits by third parties seeking to enforce their own intellectual property rights, including against certain of the intellectual property that we have acquired through our strategic acquisitions. Any such litigation, regardless of outcome, could subject us to significant liabilities or require us to cease using proprietary third party technology and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn certain markets, we may be required to address counterfeit versions of our products. We may incur significant costs in pursuing the originators of such counterfeit products and, if we are unsuccessful in eliminating them from the market, we may experience a reduction in the value of our products and/or a reduction in our net sales.\nChanges to the regulatory environment in which we or our customers operate may negatively impact our business.\nThe telecommunications and cable television industries are subject to significant and changing federal and state regulation, both in the U.S. and other countries, including regulations regarding the \u201cOpen Internet\u201d or \u201cnet neutrality\u201d. Changes to the way in which internet service providers are regulated could adversely impact our customers\u2019 decisions regarding capital spending, which could decrease demand for our products. Manufacturers of telecommunications equipment are subject to various environmental regulations relating to electrical equipment generally, including, without limitation, The Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive 2002/95/EC (RoHS), in the European Union regarding the use of certain hazardous materials used in the\nmanufacturing of various types of electronic and electrical equipment, regulations under the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive 2002/96/EC (WEEE), regarding the collection, recycling and recovery for electrical goods and regulations under the European Community Regulation EC 1907/2006 regulating chemicals and their safe use. Compliance with these environmental regulations could increase the cost of manufacturing our products. If we were unable to comply with these regulations we may not be able to sell noncompliant products in certain markets.\nRegulatory changes of more general applicability could also have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, changes to the U.S. corporate tax system have been proposed that would lead to the taxation of foreign earnings at the time they are earned rather than when they are repatriated to the U.S. Implementation of such changes would have an adverse effect on our net income and would require us to make earlier cash tax payments which would have a negative effect on our cash flows.\nCompliance with current and future environmental laws, potential environmental liabilities and the impact of climate change may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air and water, management of regulated materials, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and investigation and remediation of contaminated sites. Because of the nature of our business, we have incurred and will continue to incur costs relating to compliance with or liability under these environmental laws and regulations. In addition, new laws and regulations, including those regulating the types of substances allowable in certain of our products, new or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediation or discharge requirements, could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. For example, the European Union has issued RoHS and WEEE regulating the manufacture, use and disposal of electrical goods. If we are unable to comply with these and similar laws in other jurisdictions, or to sufficiently increase prices or otherwise reduce costs to offset the increased cost of compliance, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe physical effect of future climate change (such as increases in severe weather) may have an impact on our suppliers, customers, employees and facilities which we are unable to quantify, but which may be material.\nEfforts to regulate emissions of GHGs, such as carbon dioxide are underway in the U.S. and other countries which could increase the cost of raw materials, production processes and transportation of our products. If we are unable to comply with such regulations, sufficiently increase prices or otherwise reduce costs to offset the increased costs of compliance, GHG regulation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nCertain environmental laws impose strict and in some circumstances joint and several liability (that could result in an entity paying more than its fair share) on current or former owners or operators of a contaminated property, as well as companies that generated, disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at a contaminated property, for the costs of investigation and remediation of the contaminated property. Our present and past facilities have been in operation for many years and over that time, in the course of those operations, hazardous substances and wastes have been used, generated and disposed of at such facilities and investigation and remediation projects are underway at a few of these sites. There can be no assurance that the contractual indemnifications we have received from prior owners and operators of certain of these facilities will continue to be honored. In addition, we have disposed of waste products either directly or through third parties at numerous disposal sites, and from time to time we have been and may be held responsible for investigation and clean-up costs at these sites where those owners and operators have been unable to remain in business. Also, there can be no guarantee that new environmental requirements or changes in their enforcement or the discovery of previously unknown conditions will not cause us to incur additional costs for environmental matters which could be material.\nOur dependence on commodities subjects us to cost volatility and potential availability constraints which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nOur profitability may be materially affected by changes in the market price and availability of certain raw materials, most of which are linked to the commodity markets. The principal raw materials we purchase are rods, tapes, sheets, wires, tubes and hardware made of copper, steel, aluminum or brass; plastics and other polymers; and optical fiber. Fabricated copper, steel and aluminum are used in the production of coaxial and twisted pair cables and polymers are used to insulate and protect cables. Prices for copper, steel, aluminum, fluoropolymers and certain other polymers, derived from oil and natural gas, have experienced significant volatility as a result of changes in the levels of global demand, supply disruptions and other factors. As a result, we have adjusted our prices for certain products and may have to adjust prices again in the future. Delays in implementing price increases or a failure to achieve market acceptance of price increases has in the past and could in the future have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In an environment of falling commodities prices, we may be unable to sell higher-cost inventory before implementing price decreases, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on a limited number of key suppliers for certain raw materials and components.\nFor certain of our raw material and component purchases, including certain polymers, copper rod, copper and aluminum tapes, fine aluminum wire, steel wire, optical fiber, circuit boards and other electronic components, we are dependent on a limited number of key suppliers.\nOur key suppliers have in the past and could in the future experience production, operational or financial difficulties, or there may be global shortages of the raw materials or components we use, and our inability to find sources of supply on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture products in a cost-effective way which could have a material adverse effect on our gross margin and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain key employees, including our sales force.\nOur business depends upon our continued ability to hire and retain key employees, including our sales force, at our operations around the world. Competition for skilled personnel and highly qualified managers in the telecommunications industry is intense. Difficulties in obtaining or retaining employees with the necessary management, technical and financial skills needed to achieve our business objectives may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAllegations of health risks from wireless equipment may negatively affect our results of operations.\nAllegations of health risks from the electromagnetic fields generated by base stations and mobile handsets, and potential lawsuits or negative publicity relating to them, regardless of merit, could have a material adverse effect on our operations by leading consumers to reduce their use of mobile phones, reducing demand for certain of our products, or by causing us to allocate resources to address these issues.\nA significant uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe maintain insurance covering our normal business operations, including property and casualty protection that we believe is adequate. We do not generally carry insurance covering wars, acts of terrorism, earthquakes or other similar catastrophic events. We may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage on financially reasonable terms in the future. A significant uninsured loss or a loss in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the financial health of our insurers may deteriorate and our insurers may not be able to respond if we should have claims reaching their policies.\nNatural or man-made disasters or other disruptions could unfavorably affect our operations and financial performance.\nNatural or man-made disasters could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties, the temporary lack of an adequate work force, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products from suppliers and delays in the delivery of products to our customers. Damage to our properties, the lack of an adequate workforce, disruption in the supply of products from suppliers, and delays in the delivery of our products to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may experience significant variability in our quarterly or annual effective income tax rate.\nWe have a large and complex international tax profile and a significant level of net operating loss and other carryforwards in various jurisdictions. Variability in the mix and profitability of domestic and international activities, repatriation of earnings from foreign affiliates, changes in tax laws, identification and resolution of various tax uncertainties and the inability to realize net operating loss and other carryforwards included in deferred tax assets, among other matters, may significantly impact our effective income tax rate in the future. A significant increase in our quarterly or annual effective income tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nLabor unrest could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhile none of our U.S. employees are represented by unions, substantially all of our international employees are members of unions or subject to workers\u2019 councils or similar statutory arrangements. In addition, many of our direct and indirect customers and vendors have unionized work forces. Strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by these customers or vendors, contract manufacturers or their other suppliers could result in slowdowns. Organizations responsible for shipping our products may also be impacted by strikes. Any interruption in the delivery of our products could harm our reputation or reduce demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn general, we consider our labor relations with all of our employees to be good. However, in the future we may be subject to labor unrest with respect to our employees or those of our vendors or customers. Occurrences of strikes, work stoppages or lock-outs at our facilities or at the facilities of our vendors or customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future research and development projects may not be successful.\nThe successful development of telecommunications products can be affected by many factors. Products that appear to be promising at their early phases of research and development may fail to be commercialized for various reasons, including the failure to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. There is no assurance that any of our future research and development projects will be successful or completed within the anticipated time frame or budget or that we will receive the necessary approvals from relevant authorities for the production of these newly developed products, or that these newly developed products will achieve commercial success. Even if such products can be successfully commercialized, they may not achieve the level of market acceptance that we expect.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (the DRC), and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012 the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. These new requirements will require continued due diligence efforts in fiscal 2015, with our initial disclosure\nrequirements beginning in May 2016. The implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d conflict minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary materials produced from conflict free minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. We will likely be asked to make similar certifications as to the \u201cconflict free\u201d status of the minerals we use to our customers. If we are unable or fail to make the requisite certifications, our customers may terminate their relationship with us. Also, we may face adverse effects to our reputation if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement.\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our revenue and operating results.\nHistorically, our operations have been seasonal, with a greater portion of total net revenue and operating income occurring in the second and third fiscal quarters. As a result of this seasonality, any factors negatively affecting us during the second and third fiscal quarters of any year, including the variability of shipments under large contracts, customers\u2019 seasonal installation considerations and variations in product mix and in profitability of individual orders, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for the entire year. See \u201cBacklog and Seasonality\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our quarterly results of operations also may fluctuate based upon other factors, including general economic conditions.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations with respect to our indebtedness.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $2.7 billion of indebtedness on a consolidated basis, including $650.0 million of 5.0% Senior Notes due 2021 (the 2021 Notes) and $650.0 million of 5.5% Senior Notes due 2024 (the 2024 Notes), $550.0 million of 6.625%/7.375% Senior PIK Toggle Notes due 2020 (senior PIK toggle notes) and $864.1 million of senior secured term loans. We had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and approximately $321.7 million in borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility, reflecting a borrowing base of $345.3 million and $23.6 million of outstanding letters of credit. Our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility depends, in part, on inventory, accounts receivable and other assets that fluctuate from time to time and may further depend on lenders\u2019 discretionary ability to impose reserves and availability blocks and to recharacterize assets that might otherwise incrementally decrease borrowing availability.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our annual cash flow for the next several years to the payment of interest on our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increased interest rates as, over the term of our debt, the interest cost on a significant portion of our indebtedness is subject to changes in interest rates;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to certain of our competitors who have less debt;\n\u2022\nhinder our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to secure adequate bank financing in the future with reasonable terms and conditions; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, a potential downturn in general economic conditions or in one or more of our businesses.\nIn addition, the indentures governing the senior PIK toggle notes, the 2021 Notes and the 2024 Notes (together, the Notes Indentures) and the agreements governing our senior secured credit facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our debts. See \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Related to the Acquisition\u201d.\nDespite current indebtedness levels and restrictive covenants, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness or we may pay dividends in the future. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial financial leverage.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future under the agreements governing our indebtedness. Although the Notes Indentures and the credit agreements governing our senior secured credit facilities contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of thresholds, qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Additionally, these restrictions permit us to incur obligations that, although preferential to our common stock in terms of payment, do not constitute indebtedness. As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $321.7 million of additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility.\nIn addition, if new debt is added to our and/or our subsidiaries\u2019 debt levels, the related risks that we now face as a result of our leverage would intensify.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur operations are conducted through our subsidiaries and our ability to make cash payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on the earnings and the distribution of funds from our subsidiaries. However, none of our subsidiaries is obligated to make funds available to us for payment on our indebtedness. Further, the terms of the instruments governing our indebtedness significantly restrict certain of our subsidiaries from paying dividends and otherwise transferring assets to us. Our ability to make cash payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, to fund planned capital expenditures and to meet other cash requirements will depend on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We might not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings may not be available under our senior secured credit facilities in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. In such circumstances, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the senior PIK toggle notes, the 2021 Notes and the 2024 Notes, on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. Such actions, if necessary, may not be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our indebtedness may restrict our ability to sell assets and limit the use of the proceeds from such sales.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under our revolving credit facility could elect to terminate their\ncommitments thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to obtain waivers from the required lenders under our senior secured credit facilities to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under our senior secured credit facilities and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders. If this occurs, we would be in default under our senior secured credit facilities, the lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nCommScope Holding Company, Inc. is a holding company with no operations of its own, and it depends on its subsidiaries for cash to fund all of its operations and expenses, including to make future dividend payments, if any.\nOur operations are conducted almost entirely through our subsidiaries and our ability to generate cash to meet our debt service obligations or to make future dividend payments, if any, is highly dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries via dividends or intercompany loans. We do not currently expect to declare or pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future; however, to the extent that we determine in the future to pay dividends on our common stock, the Notes Indentures and the credit agreements governing our senior secured credit facilities, significantly restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer assets to us. In addition, Delaware law may impose requirements that may restrict our ability to pay dividends to holders of our common stock.\nWe are controlled by Carlyle, whose interests in our business may be different than yours.\nAs of December 31, 2014, Carlyle owned approximately 54% of our common stock and is able to control our affairs in all cases. Pursuant to an amended and restated stockholders agreement, Carlyle has the right to designate up to nine of our eleven directors and a majority of the Board of Directors has been designated by Carlyle and is affiliated with Carlyle. As a result, Carlyle or its nominees to the Board of Directors have the ability to control the appointment of our management, the entering into of mergers, sales of substantially all of our assets and other extraordinary transactions and influence amendments to our certificate of incorporation. So long as Carlyle continues to own a majority of our common stock, they will have the ability to control the vote in any election of directors and will have the ability to prevent any transaction that requires stockholder approval regardless of whether others believe the transaction is in our best interests. In any of these matters, the interests of Carlyle may differ from or conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. Moreover, this concentration of stock ownership may also adversely affect the trading price for our common stock to the extent investors perceive disadvantages in owning stock of a company with a controlling stockholder or anticipate further sales of shares by Carlyle.\nIn addition, Carlyle is in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time, acquire interests in businesses that directly or indirectly compete with our business, as well as businesses that are significant existing or potential customers.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could lower our share price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities may be dilutive and may adversely affect us or the market price of our common stock.\nWe or Carlyle, may sell additional shares of common stock. We may also issue additional shares of common stock or convertible debt securities to finance future acquisitions, including the TE Acquisition. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including sales that may occur pursuant to Carlyle\u2019s registration rights and shares that may be issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect the market prices for our common stock. Future changes in the level of Carlyle ownership could, depending on the timing of such changes, have an adverse effect on our ability to utilize various tax attributes.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, the ability of investors to achieve a return on their investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to declare and pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to reduce indebtedness and fund our growth. Therefore, common stock investors are not likely to receive any dividends for the foreseeable future and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value. However, the payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends and other considerations that our Board of Directors deems relevant. The Notes Indentures and the credit agreements governing our senior secured credit facilities also effectively limit our ability to pay dividends. As a consequence of these limitations and restrictions, we may not be able to make, or may have to reduce or eliminate, the payment of dividends on our common stock.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, as a result, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions:\n\u2022\nauthorize 1,300,000,000 shares of common stock, which, to the extent unissued, could be issued without stockholder approval by the Board of Directors to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance, without stockholder approval, of blank check preferred stock that our Board of Directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares and to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\ngrant to the Board of Directors the sole power to set the number of directors and to fill any vacancy on the Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nlimit the ability of stockholders to remove directors only \u201cfor cause\u201d if Carlyle and its affiliates collectively cease to own more than 50% of our common stock and require any such removal to be approved by holders of at least three-quarters of the outstanding shares of common stock;\n\u2022\nprohibit our stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders if Carlyle and its affiliates collectively cease to own more than 50% of our common stock;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders, if Carlyle and its affiliates collectively cease to own more than 50% of our common stock;\n\u2022\nprovide that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, or to alter or repeal our bylaws; establish advance notice and certain information requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nestablish a classified Board of Directors, with three staggered terms; and\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of holders of at least three-quarters of the outstanding shares of common stock to amend the bylaws and certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation if Carlyle and its affiliates collectively cease to own more than 50% of our common stock.\nIn addition, we opted out of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the DGCL), which, subject to some exceptions, prohibits business combinations between a Delaware corporation and an\ninterested stockholder, which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation\u2019s voting stock for a three-year period following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder.\nThese anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company and may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if the provisions are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and cause us to take corporate actions other than those you desire.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the rules of Nasdaq and, as a result, qualify for, and intend to continue to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. Our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nCarlyle continues to control a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As a result, we are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of Nasdaq. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d and may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including:\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a majority of the Board of Directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022\nthe requirements that director nominees are selected, or recommended for selection by the Board of Directors, either by (1) independent directors constituting a majority of the Board\u2019s independent directors in a vote in which only independent directors participate or (2) a nominations committee comprised solely of independent directors, and that a formal written charter or board resolution, as applicable, addressing the nominations process is adopted.\nWe intend to continue to utilize these exemptions for as long as we continue to qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company.\u201d While exempt, we will not have a majority of independent directors and our nominating and compensation committees will not consist entirely of independent directors and such committees will not be subject to annual performance evaluations. Accordingly, our stockholders do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq.\nRisks Related to the Acquisition\nThe proposed acquisition of the Acquired Business may not be completed on a timely basis, on anticipated terms, or at all, and there are uncertainties and risks to consummating the Acquisition.\nAs previously described, on January 27, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement (the \u201cAcquisition Agreement\u201d) with TE Connectivity Ltd. (\u201cTE\u201d), to purchase its Telecom, Enterprise and Wireless businesses, including its managed connectivity business (the \u201cAcquired Business\u201d), for $3.0 billion in cash (such acquisition, the \u201cAcquisition\u201d). The obligation of each party to consummate the Acquisition is subject to the satisfaction or waiver, to the extent permitted under applicable law, of a number of conditions, many of which are not within our control. These conditions include expiration or termination of the waiting period (and any extensions thereof) applicable under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the \u201cHSR Act\u201d), the receipt of all required clearances, approvals or authorizations required by certain other specified foreign governmental authorities under applicable antitrust laws and the absence of any order, judgment, injunction, law or other legal restraint prohibiting the consummation of the Acquisition. Our obligation to consummate the Acquisition is also subject the absence of a material adverse effect on the business, operations or condition of the Acquired\nBusiness, and each party\u2019s obligation to consummate the Acquisition is subject to certain additional closing conditions, including (i) the accuracy of the other party\u2019s representations and warranties contained in Acquisition Agreement (subject to certain materiality qualifiers) and (ii) the other party\u2019s compliance in all material respects with its covenants and agreements contained in the Acquisition Agreement.\nThe failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the Acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in completing the Acquisition could cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the Acquisition is successfully completed within its expected timeframe. Additionally, it is not certain that the conditions set forth in the Acquisition Agreement will be met or waived, that the necessary approvals will be obtained, or that we will be able to successfully consummate the Acquisition as provided for under the Acquisition Agreement, or at all.\nWe face risks and uncertainties due both to the pending Acquisition as well as the potential failure to consummate the Acquisition, including:\n\u2022\nif the Acquisition is not consummated, we will not realize any of the expected benefits of the Acquisition;\n\u2022\nfailure to consummate the Acquisition could result in negative reactions from the financial markets or in the investment community, including negative impacts on our stock price;\n\u2022\nwe will remain liable for significant transaction costs, including legal, financial advisory, accounting and other costs relating to the Acquisition even if it is not consummated;\n\u2022\nif the Acquisition Agreement is terminated before we complete the Acquisition, under some circumstances, including in the event we fail to obtain the required antitrust approvals or we are unable to secure the financing necessary to consummate the Acquisition, we may have to pay a termination fee to TE of $210 million in cash;\n\u2022\nthe pending Acquisition could have an adverse impact on our relationships with employees, customers and suppliers, and prospective customers or other third parties may delay or decline entering into agreements with us as a result of the announcement of the Acquisition; and\n\u2022\nthe attention of our management and employees may be diverted from day-to-day operations.\nThe occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our share price, business, cash flows, results of operations and financial position.\nIn order to complete the Acquisition, we must make certain governmental filings and obtain certain governmental authorizations under applicable antitrust laws, and if such filings and authorizations are not made or granted or are granted with conditions, or if governmental authorities otherwise seek to impose conditions or to challenge the Acquisition, completion of the Acquisition may be jeopardized or the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition could be reduced.\nAlthough we and TE have agreed in the Acquisition Agreement to use our reasonable best efforts, subject to certain limitations, to make certain governmental filings and obtain the required expiration or termination of the waiting period or approvals under the HSR Act and multiple foreign antitrust laws, there can be no assurance that the termination of the waiting period or receipt of approvals under the HSR Act and applicable foreign antitrust laws will occur. There can also be no assurance that governmental authorities will not seek to challenge the Acquisition or impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying completion of the Acquisition or imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of our business and the Acquired Business following the Acquisition, or otherwise adversely affecting our business and the Acquired Business after completion of the Acquisition; provided, that, under the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, we are not required to take any action that would, or would reasonably be expected to, impose (i) any material limitation on our ability effectively to acquire the\nfull rights of ownership of the assets of the Acquired Business, (ii) a material reduction in the reasonably anticipated benefits (financial or otherwise) of the Acquisition or (iii) an impact that is materially adverse to the assets, business, results of operation or condition (financial or otherwise) of our business or the Acquired Business. In addition, in the event we fail to obtain the required antitrust approvals and the Acquisition Agreement is terminated as a result thereof, we will be required to pay a termination fee to TE of $210 million in cash. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our share price, business, cash flows, results of operations and financial position.\nIntegration of the Acquired Business into our business will be difficult, costly and time consuming and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Acquisition may not be realized.\nEven if the Acquisition is completed, our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate the two businesses. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate the Acquired Business into our business, or if such integration is successfully accomplished, that such integration will not be more costly or take longer than presently contemplated. If we cannot successfully integrate and manage the Acquired Business within a reasonable time following the Acquisition, we may not be able to realize the potential and anticipated benefits of the Acquisition, which could have a material adverse effect on our share price, business, cash flows, results of operations and financial position.\nOur ability to realize the expected synergies and benefits of the Acquisition is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control. These risks and uncertainties could adversely impact our business, results of operation and financial condition and include, among other things:\n\u2022\nour ability to complete the timely integration of operations and systems, organizations, standards, controls, procedures, policies and technologies, as well as the harmonization of differences in the business cultures of our company and the Acquired Business;\n\u2022\nour ability to minimize the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns of both our business and the Acquired Business during the process of integrating our company and the Acquired Business;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain the service of senior management and other key personnel of both our business and the Acquired Business;\n\u2022\nour ability to preserve customer, supplier and other important relationships of our company and the Acquired Business and resolve potential conflicts that may arise;\n\u2022\nthe risk that certain customers and suppliers of the Acquired Business will opt to discontinue business with the Acquired Business or exercise their right to terminate their agreements as a result of the Acquisition pursuant to change of control provisions in their agreements;\n\u2022\nthe risk that the Acquired Business may have liabilities that we failed to or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence;\n\u2022\nthe risk that integrating the Acquired Business into our business may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than anticipated;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the combination;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex combined business; and\n\u2022\nthe risk that regulatory agencies will require that we dispose of material aspects of our business or the Acquired Business as a condition to the consummation of the Acquisition.\nWe may encounter additional integration-related costs, may fail to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the acquisition or be subject to other factors that adversely affect preliminary estimates. In addition, even if the\noperations of the Acquired Business are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the Acquisition may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are expected. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our share price, business and cash flows, results of operations and financial position. The Acquisition may not be accretive to earnings or other key financial metrics, which may also negatively affect the price of our common stock following consummation of the Acquisition.\nFollowing the closing of the Acquisition, we expect that we will be relying on TE to provide a wide range of services required to operate the Acquired Business under Transition Services Agreements (TSAs) for an extended period.\nDue to the high level of integration of the Acquired Business with the remainder of TE\u2019s business, it will be highly complex and time consuming to separate the Acquired Business in order to effectively begin to integrate them with our business. As a result, we will be dependent on TE to continue to perform elements of such critical functions as information technology, human resources, finance, logistics and operations for parts or all of the Acquired Business under TSAs. It may be up to several years before we are able to assume all of these functions and discontinue the TSAs.\nWhile operating under these TSAs, we are exposed to various risks, including the following:\n\u2022\ncosts of operating the Acquired Business may be greater than we anticipated;\n\u2022\nwe may need to operate under the TSAs for longer than expected;\n\u2022\nwe may not get information necessary to realize the anticipated synergies while we are operating under the TSAs; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to maintain an effective system of internal controls over financial reporting while operating under the TSAs.\nWe may be unable to realize the expected growth opportunities and cost savings from the Acquisition.\nWe currently expect to realize annual cost savings of approximately $150 million to be fully achieved within three years of the closing of the Acquisition. The anticipated cost savings are based upon assumptions about our ability to implement integration measures in a timely fashion and within certain cost parameters. Our ability to achieve the planned cost synergies is dependent upon a significant number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. For example, we may be unable to eliminate duplicative costs in a timely fashion or at all. Our inability to realize anticipated cost savings and revenue enhancements from the Acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our share price, business, cash flows, results of operations and financial position.\nWe currently expect to incur significant additional indebtedness to finance the Acquisition, and such increased debt levels could adversely affect our business, cash flow and results of operations.\nWe expect to incur up to $3.0 billion of indebtedness in connection with the Acquisition. As a result of this indebtedness, our interest payment obligations will increase substantially. The degree to which we are leveraged could have adverse effects on our business, including the following:\n\u2022\nmaking it difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our credit facility and contractual and commercial commitments;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to make additional strategic acquisitions or exploit business opportunities;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to refinance indebtedness, or increasing the associated costs;\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in the business;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds; and\n\u2022\ndecreasing our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic and industry conditions.\nIf we incur additional debt in the future, these risks will intensify. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend upon our future performance, which will be subject to the financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the agreements that will govern the indebtedness to be incurred or assumed in connection with our acquisition of the Acquired Business are expected to contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may, subject to certain exceptions, restrict our ability to, among other things, engage in certain business transactions or incur additional indebtedness.\nAdditionally, pursuant to the terms of the financing commitment, if the Acquisition is not consummated within six months of the date of the Acquisition Agreement we will begin to incur significant additional expenses either in the form of ticking fees or in interest (if we are required to incur the indebtedness contemplated by the financing commitment prior to the consummation of the Acquisition) that in each case will accrue until the Acquisition is successfully consummated or the Acquisition Agreement is terminated.\nAlthough we have a financing commitment from lenders for this indebtedness, the commitment is subject to certain conditions, and we cannot assure that those conditions will be satisfied. If we fail to secure the financing necessary to consummate the Acquisition and the Acquisition Agreement is terminated as a result thereof, we will be required to pay a termination fee to TE of $210 million in cash.", "PERMNO": 14239, "SIC": 3663, "TIC": "COMM"}
