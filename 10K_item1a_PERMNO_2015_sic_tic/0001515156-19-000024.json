{"cik": "1515156", "company": "Advanced Emissions Solutions, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risks relate to us as of the date this Report is filed with the SEC. This list of risks is not intended to be exhaustive, but reflects what we believe are the material risks inherent in our business and the ownership of our securities as of the specified dates. A statement to the effect that the occurrence of a specified event may have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, profitability, financial condition, or the like, is intended to reflect the fact that such an event would be likely to have a negative impact on your investment in ADES, but should not imply the likelihood of the occurrence of such specified event. The order in which the following risk factors are presented is not intended as an indication of the relative seriousness of any given risk.\nRisks relating to our business\nDemand for our products and services depends significantly on environmental laws and regulations. Uncertainty as to the future of such laws and regulations, as well as changes to such laws and regulations, or granting of extensions of compliance deadlines has had, and will likely continue to have a material effect on our business.\nA significant market driver for our existing products and services, and those planned in the future, are present and expected environmental laws and regulations, particularly those addressing the reduction of mercury and other emissions from coal-fired electricity generating units. If such laws and regulations are delayed, or are not enacted or are repealed or amended to be less strict, or include prolonged phase-in periods, or are not enforced, our business would be adversely affected by declining demand for such products and services. For example:\n\u2022\nThe implementation of environmental regulations regarding certain pollution control and permitting requirements has been delayed from time to time due to various lawsuits. The uncertainty created by litigation and reconsiderations of rule-making by the EPA has negatively impacted our business, results of operations and financial condition and will likely continue to do so.\n\u2022\nTo the extent federal, state, and local legislation mandating that electric power generating companies serving a state or region purchase a minimum amount of power from renewable energy sources such as wind, hydroelectric, solar and geothermal, and such amount lessens demand for electricity from coal-fired plants, the demand for our products and services would likely decrease.\nFederal, state, and international laws or regulations addressing emissions from coal-fired electricity generating units, climate change or other actions to limit emissions, including public opposition to new coal-fired electricity generating units, has caused and could continue to cause electricity generators to transition from coal to other fuel and power sources, such as natural gas, nuclear, wind, hydroelectric and solar. The potential financial impact on us of future laws or regulations or public pressure will depend upon the degree to which electricity generators diminish their reliance on coal as a fuel source. That, in turn, will depend on a number of factors, including the specific requirements imposed by any such laws or regulations, the periods over which those laws or regulations are or will be phased in, the amount of public opposition, and the state and cost of commercial development of related technologies and processes. In addition, Public Utility Commissions (\"PUCs\") may not allow utilities to charge consumers for, and pass on the cost of, emissions control technologies without federal or state mandate. We cannot reasonably predict the impact that any such future laws or regulations or public opposition may have on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nAction by the EPA related to MATS that decreases demand for our mercury removal products could have a material adverse effect on our PGI segment.\nGrowth in our PGI segment depends on stable demand for mercury removal related product, which is largely dependent on the amount of coal-based power generation used in the U.S. and the continued regulation of utilities under MATS. In August 2018, the EPA announced that it intends to reconsider the MATS rule and in September 2018 submitted its proposal to the White House Office of Management and Budget. In February 2019, the EPA published a reconsideration of its 2016 \"supplemental finding\" associated with the cost benefit analysis of the MATS Rule. This reconsideration proposes that it is not 'appropriate or necessary' to regulate HAPs emissions from coal- and oil-filed EGUs. However, the EPA expressly states that the reconsideration is not removing coal- and oil-fired EGUs from the list of sources that must comply with the MATS rule, but does, in the reconsideration, solicit comments on whether the EPA has the authority to remove coal- and oil-fired EGUs from the list of sources that must comply with the MATS Rule or whether it can rescind the MATS Rule. Any final action taken by the EPA related to MATS that decreases demand for our products for mercury removal will have a negative effect on the financial results of our PGI segment.\nThe failure of tariffs placed on U.S. imports of Chinese activated carbon to adequately address the impact of low-priced imports from China could have a material adverse effect on the competitiveness and financial performance of our PGI segment.\nOur PGI segment faces competition in the U.S. from low-priced imports of activated carbon products. If the amounts of these low-priced imports increase, especially if they are sold at less than fair value, our sales of competing products could decline, which could have an adverse effect on the earnings of our PGI segment. In addition, sales of these low-priced imports may negatively impact our pricing. To limit these activities, regulators in the U.S. have enacted an anti-dumping duty order on steam activated carbon products from China. In 2018, the order was extended for an additional five years. The amount of anti-dumping duties collected on imports of steam activated carbon from China is reviewed annually by the U.S. Department of Commerce. To the extent the anti-dumping margins do not adequately address the degree to which imports are unfairly traded, the anti-dumping order may be less effective in reducing the volume of these low-priced activated carbon imports in the U.S., which could negatively affect demand and/or pricing for our AC products.\nThe market for consumables and other products that provide pollutant reduction is highly competitive and some of our competitors are significantly larger and more established than we are, which could adversely impede our growth opportunities and financial results.\nWe operate in a highly competitive marketplace. Our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a cost of production advantage, competitive technological capabilities and to continue to identify, develop and commercialize new and innovative products for existing and future customers. Increased competition from existing or newly developed products offered by our competitors or companies whose products offer a similar functionality as our products and could be substituted for our products, may negatively affect demand for our products. In addition, market competition could negatively impact our ability to maintain or raise prices or maintain or grow our market position.\nWe compete against certain significantly larger and/or more established companies in the market for consumables and other products that provide mercury emissions reduction and water treatment.\nReduction of coal consumption by U.S. electricity power generators could result in less demand for our products and services. If utilities significantly reduce the number of coal-fired electricity generating units or the amount of coal burned, without a corresponding increase in the services required at the remaining units, this could reduce our revenues and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe amount of coal consumed for U.S. electricity power generation is affected by, among other things, (1) the location, availability, quality and price of alternative energy sources for power generation, such as natural gas, fuel oil, nuclear, hydroelectric, wind, biomass and solar power; and (2) technological developments, including those related to competing alternative energy sources.\nNatural gas-fueled generation has been displacing and may continue to displace coal-fueled generation, particularly from older, less efficient coal-powered generators. We expect that many of the new power plants needed to meet increasing demand for electricity generation will be fueled by natural gas because the price of natural gas has remained at relatively low levels after a period of sharp decline, and use of natural gas is perceived as having a lower environmental impact than burning coal. Natural gas-fired plants are cheaper to construct, and permits to construct these plants are easier to obtain, and ongoing costs of natural gas-fired plants associated with meeting environmental compliance are lower. Possible advances in technologies and incentives, such as tax credits, to enhance the economics of renewable energy sources could make those sources more competitive with coal. Any reduction in the amount of coal consumed by domestic electricity power generators, whether as a result of new power plants utilizing alternative energy sources or as a result of technological advances, could reduce the demand for our current products and services, thereby reducing our revenues and materially and adversely affecting our business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, long-term changes in environmental regulation that threaten or preclude the use of coal or other fossil fuels as a primary fuel source for electricity production, and result in the reduction or closure of a significant number of coal-fired electric generating units, may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face operational risks inherent in mining operations and our mining operations have the potential to cause safety issues, including those that could result in significant personal injury.\nWe own a lignite coal mine located in Louisiana that is operated for us by Demery Resources Company, LLC. Mining operations by their nature involve a high level of uncertainty and are often affected by risks and hazards outside of our control.\nAt our lignite mine, the risks are primarily operational risks associated with the maintenance and operation of the heavy equipment required to dig and haul the lignite, and risks relating to lower than expected lignite quality or recovery rates. The failure to adequately manage these risks could result in significant personal injury, loss of life, damage to mineral properties, production facilities or mining equipment, damage to the environment, delays in or reduced production, and potential legal liabilities.\nOur operations and products are subject to extensive safety, health and environmental requirements that could increase our costs and/or impair our ability to manufacture and sell certain products.\nOur ongoing operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to safety, health and environmental matters, many of which provide for substantial monetary fines and criminal sanctions for violations. These include requirements to obtain and comply with various environmental-related permits for constructing any new facilities and operating all of our existing facilities. In addition, our AC manufacturing facility may become subject to greenhouse gas emission trading schemes under which we may be required to purchase emission credits if our emission levels exceed our allocations. Greenhouse gas regulatory programs that have been adopted, such as cap-and-trade programs, have not had a significant impact on our business to date. Costs of complying with regulations could increase as concerns related to greenhouse gases and climate change continue to emerge. The enactment of new environmental laws and regulations and/or the more aggressive interpretation of existing requirements could require us to incur significant costs for compliance or capital improvements or limit our current or planned operations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings or cash flow. We attempt to offset the effects of these compliance costs through price increases, productivity improvements and cost reduction efforts, and our success in offsetting any such increased regulatory costs is largely influenced by competitive and economic conditions and could vary significantly depending on the segment served. Such increases may not be accepted by our customers, may not be sufficient to compensate for increased regulatory costs or may decrease demand for our products and our volume of sales.\nIf we are unable to timely and successfully integrate the Carbon Solutions Acquisition, our future financial performance may suffer and we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction.\nWe acquired Carbon Solutions primarily to expand our market share in the mercury emissions control market, as well as to gain access to the water treatment market through Carbon Solutions' specific products for this market. Our future growth may depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate Carbon Solutions into our business and we cannot guarantee that we will successfully integrate Carbon Solutions into our existing operations, or that we will achieve the desired profitability and anticipated results from the Carbon Solutions Acquisition. Failure to achieve such planned results could adversely affect our operations and cash available to make debt principal and interest payments, dividends and stock repurchases.\nThe Carbon Solutions Acquisition presents potential risks to us, including:\n\u2022\noperating a significantly larger combined organization and integrating additional operations into ours;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation of the assets and operations of Carbon Solutions;\n\u2022\nthe loss of customers or key employees from Carbon Solutions;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other existing business concerns;\n\u2022\nthe failure to realize expected synergies and cost savings;\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically disparate organizations, systems and facilities;\n\u2022\nintegrating personnel from diverse business backgrounds and organizational cultures; and\n\u2022\nconsolidating corporate and administrative functions.\nWe may make future acquisitions or form partnerships and joint ventures that may involve numerous risks that could impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur strategy may include expanding our scope of products and services organically or through selective acquisitions, investments or creating partnerships and joint ventures. We have acquired, and may selectively acquire, other businesses, product or service lines, assets or technologies that are complementary to our business. We may be unable to find or consummate future acquisitions at acceptable prices and terms, or we may be unable to integrate existing or future acquisitions effectively and efficiently and may need to divest those acquisitions. We continually evaluate potential acquisition opportunities in the ordinary course of business. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including among others:\n\u2022\nour evaluation of the synergies and/or long-term benefits of an acquired business;\n\u2022\nintegration difficulties, including challenges and costs associated with implementing systems and processes to comply with requirements of being part of a publicly-traded company;\n\u2022\ndiverting management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022\nlitigation arising from acquisition activity;\n\u2022\npotential increased debt leverage;\n\u2022\npotential issuance of dilutive equity securities;\n\u2022\nentering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs and exposure to undisclosed or unforeseen liabilities or operating challenges;\n\u2022\npotential goodwill or other intangible asset impairments;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired businesses, product or service lines, assets or technologies;\n\u2022\nour ability to properly establish and maintain effective internal controls over an acquired company; and\n\u2022\nincreasing demands on our operational and IT systems.\nThe success of acquisitions of businesses, new technologies and products, or arrangements with third parties is not always predictable and we may not be successful in realizing our objectives as anticipated. The Senior Term Loan and Line of Credit contain certain covenants that limit, or that may have the effect of limiting, among other things, the payment of dividends, acquisitions, capital expenditures, the sale of assets and the incurrence of additional indebtedness.\nInformation technology vulnerabilities and cyberattacks on our networks could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe rely upon information technology (\"IT\") to manage and conduct business, both internally and externally, with our customers, suppliers and other third parties. Internet transactions involve the transmission and storage of data including, in certain instances, customer and supplier business information. Therefore, maintaining the security of computers and other electronic devices, computer networks and data storage resources is a critical issue for us and our customers and suppliers because security breaches could result in reduced or lost ability to carry on our business and loss of and/or unauthorized access to confidential information. We have limited personnel and other resources to address information technology reliability and security of our computer networks and to respond to known security incidents to minimize potential adverse impact. Experienced hackers, cybercriminals and perpetrators of threats may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. These perpetrators of cyberattacks also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, malware and other malicious software programs that attack our information and networks or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our information and networks. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until long after being launched against a target, and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. A breach of our IT systems and security measures as a result of third-party action, malware, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations and expose us to customer, supplier and other third-party liabilities.\nNatural disasters could affect our operations and financial results.\nWe operate facilities that are exposed to natural hazards, such as floods, windstorms and hurricanes. Extreme weather events present physical risks that may become more frequent as a result of factors related to climate change. Such events could disrupt our supply of raw materials or otherwise affect production, transportation and delivery of our products or affect demand for our products.\nRisks relating to Refined Coal\nThe ability of Tinuum Group to generate revenues from the sale or lease of RC facilities to tax equity investors is not assured, and the inability to sell, lease or operate RC facilities to produce and sell RC and generate Section 45 production tax credits could adversely affect our future growth and profitability.\nTinuum Group is attempting to sell or lease its remaining RC facilities to third-party investors. The inability of Tinuum Group to successfully lease or sell additional RC facilities to third-party tax equity investors, who may receive the benefit of the Section 45 tax credits that are expected to be generated from those RC facilities, as well as RC facilities that may be returned to Tinuum Group over time, would likely have an adverse effect on our future growth and profitability.\nFurthermore, if, in the future, electricity power generators decide to limit coal-fired generation for economic reasons and/or do not burn and use RC and instead switch to another power or fuel source, Tinuum Group would likely be unable to fully produce and sell the RC and the associated Section 45 production tax credits potentially available from RC facilities over the anticipated term of the Section 45 tax credit program.\nThe ability to generate Section 45 tax credits from existing operating RC facilities ends in 2021, which could eliminate the desire for investors to further lease RC facilities beyond this date, which would effectively eliminate Tinuum Group\u2019s and Tinuum Services' operations and significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations beyond 2021.\nA substantial amount of our earnings and cash flows in 2018 and 2017 are comprised of equity method earnings and license royalties generated from Tinuum Group\u2019s invested RC facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our RC segment generated segment operating income of $65.5 million. As of December 31, 2018, Tinuum Group has 19 invested facilities and zero retained facilities. Of the 19 invested facilities, one is currently generating Section 45 tax credits that will no longer generate Section 45 tax credits beyond 2019 and the remaining 18 are generating Section 45 tax credits that will no longer generate Section 45 tax credits beyond 2021. As a result, we believe that substantially all of the invested RC facilities will be returned to Tinuum Group upon the expiration of the Section 45 tax credit program. If Tinuum Group elects to continue operating these RC facilities, their earnings will be significantly reduced and accordingly, our pro rata share will also be substantially reduced.\nAdditionally, our RC segment is the largest of our segments and the remainder of our business must grow substantially, either organically or acquisitively, in order to replace earnings from Tinuum Group that will substantially end during the 2020 to 2022-time frame. There can be no assurance that we will be able to increase our PGI segment earnings during this time frame to cover our current operating expenses or to provide a return to shareholders that is comparable to the return currently provided by our RC segment. If we are not able to cover operating expenses, we could be forced to raise additional capital, significantly reduce our operating expenses or take other alternative actions.\nThe 2017 Tax Act introduced changes in income tax rates and other specific provisions that may make Section 45 production tax credits less attractive, which, in turn, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \u201c2017 Tax Act\u201d) became law. The 2017 Tax Act, among other things, lowered the federal income tax rate on corporations from 35% to 21%, effective for the year beginning January 1, 2018 and created certain new tax provisions, including the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse tax (\u201cBEAT\u201d). In December 2018, the U.S. Treasury Department released proposed regulations addressing BEAT. The regulations are proposed to apply retroactively to tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The changes to previously higher tax rates and provisions such as BEAT could negatively impact tax capacity of current or potential tax equity investors and result in Section 45 production tax credits being less attractive.\nPresently, a group of related tax equity investors accounts for a substantial portion of our earnings from Tinuum Group and any lease renegotiation or termination by these investors or any failure to continue to produce and sell RC at the related investors' RC facilities would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAs of December 31, 2018, 11 of Tinuum Group\u2019s 28 RC facilities are leased to various affiliated entities. Significant components of our total cash flows come from Tinuum Group's distributions relating to payments received under these leases. These leases have an initial fixed period and then automatically renew, unless terminated at the option of the lessee, for successive one-year terms through 2019 or 2021. If these affiliated entities renegotiate or terminate their leases, or if the utilities where the RC facilities are installed materially reduce their use of RC, these events would have a material adverse\neffect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Certain of these affiliated entities have amended their leases from time to time, with some of the amended leases including less favorable terms to Tinuum Group.\nOur RC businesses are joint ventures and managed under operating agreements where we do not have sole control of the decision making process, and we cannot mandate decisions or ensure outcomes.\nWe oversee our joint ventures under the terms of their respective operating agreements by participating in the following activities: (1) representation on the respective governing boards of directors, (2) regular oversight of financial and operational performance and controls and establishing audit and reporting requirements, (3) hiring of management personnel, (4) technical support of RC facilities, and (5) other regular and routine involvement with our joint venture partners. Notwithstanding this regular participation and oversight, our joint venture partners also participate in the management of these businesses and they may have business or economic interests that divert their attention from the joint venture, or they may prefer to operate the business, make decisions or invest resources in a manner that is contrary to our preferences. Since material business decisions must be made jointly with our joint venture partners, we cannot mandate decisions or ensure outcomes.\nThe financial effects of Tinuum Group providing indemnification under performance guarantees of its RC facilities are largely unknown and could adversely affect our financial condition.\nTinuum Group indemnifies certain utilities and lessees of RC facilities for particular risks associated with the operations of those facilities. We have provided limited, joint and several guarantees of Tinuum Group\u2019s obligations under those leases. Any substantial payments made under such guarantees could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks related to intellectual property\nFailure to protect our intellectual property or infringement of our intellectual property by a third party could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights. Such means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate because they provide only limited protection or such protection may be prohibitively expensive to enforce. We also enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with our employees, consultants, and many of our customers and vendors, and generally control access to and distribution of our proprietary information. Notwithstanding these measures, a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization. We cannot provide assurance that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology and intellectual property, which could negatively impact our business and financial condition. In addition, such actions by third parties could divert the attention of our management from the operation of our business.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims from third parties that are costly to defend and that may limit our ability to use the disputed technologies.\nIf our technologies are alleged to infringe the intellectual property rights of others, we may be prevented from marketing and selling existing products or services and from pursuing research, development or commercialization of new or complimentary products or services. Further, we may be required to obtain licenses to third-party intellectual property, or be forced to develop or obtain alternative technologies. Our failure to obtain a license to a technology that we may require, or the need to develop or obtain alternative technologies, could significantly and negatively affect our business.\nIndemnification of third-party licensees of our technologies against intellectual property infringement claims concerning our licensed technology and our products could be financially significant to us.\nWe have agreed to indemnify licensees of our technologies (including Tinuum Group) and purchasers of our products and we may enter into additional agreements with others under which we agree to indemnify and hold them harmless from losses they may incur as a result of the infringement of third-party rights caused by the use of our technologies and products. Infringement claims, which are expensive and time-consuming to defend, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition, even if we are successful in defending ourselves (and the indemnified parties) against them.\nOur future success depends in part on our ongoing identification and development of intellectual property and our ability to invest in and deploy new products, services and technologies into the marketplace efficiently and cost effectively.\nThe process of identifying customer needs and developing and enhancing products, services and solutions for our business segments is complex, costly and uncertain. Any failure by us to identify and anticipate changing needs, emerging trends and new regulations could significantly harm our future market share and results of operations.\nRisk related to tax matters\nAn \u201cownership change\u201d could limit our ability to utilize tax loss and credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income.\nWe have certain general business credit tax credits (\u201cTax Attributes\u201d). As of December 31, 2018, we had $104.6 million of Tax Attributes, equaling 87% of our total gross deferred tax assets. Our ability to use these Tax Attributes to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d as discussed below. Under the Internal Revenue Code (\"IRC') and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury Department, we may carry forward or otherwise utilize the Tax Attributes in certain circumstances to offset any current and future taxable income and thus reduce our federal income tax liability, subject to certain requirements and restrictions. To the extent that the Tax Attributes do not otherwise become limited, we believe that we will have available a significant amount of Tax Attributes in future years, and therefore the Tax Attributes could be a substantial asset to us. However, if we experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the IRC, our ability to use the Tax Attributes may be substantially limited, and the timing of the usage of the Tax Attributes could be substantially delayed, which could therefore significantly impair the value of that asset.\nIn general, an \u201cownership change\u201d under Section 382 occurs if the percentage of stock owned by an entity\u2019s 5% stockholders (as defined for tax purposes) increases by more than 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. An entity that experiences an ownership change generally will be subject to an annual limitation on its pre-ownership change tax loss and credit carryforwards equal to the equity value of the entity immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term, tax-exempt rate posted monthly by the IRS (subject to certain adjustments). The annual limitation would be increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year. The limitation on our ability to utilize the Tax Attributes arising from an ownership change under Section 382 of the IRC would depend on the value of our equity at the time of any ownership change. If we were to experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d it is possible that a significant portion of our tax loss and credit carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them to offset future taxable income.\nOn May 5, 2017, our Board of Directors (the \"Board\") approved the Tax Asset Protection Plan (the \u201cProtection Plan\u201d) and declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (each, a \u201cRight\u201d) for each outstanding share of our common stock. The Protection Plan was adopted in an effort to protect stockholder value by attempting to diminish the risk that our ability to use the Tax Attributes to reduce potential future federal income tax obligations may become substantially limited.\nOn April 6, 2018, the Board approved the First Amendment to the Tax Asset Protection Plan (the \"Amendment\") that amends the Protection Plan dated May 5, 2017. The Amendment amends the definition of \"Final Expiration Date\" under the Protection Plan to extend its duration and makes associated changes in connection therewith. At the Company's 2018 annual meeting, the Company's stockholders approved the Amendment, thus the Final Expiration Date will be the close of business on December 31, 2019.\nThe Protection Plan, as amended, is intended to act as a deterrent to any person acquiring beneficial ownership of 4.99% or more of our outstanding common stock without the approval of the Board. Stockholders who beneficially owned 4.99% or more of our outstanding common stock upon execution of the Plan will not trigger the Protection Plan so long as they do not acquire beneficial ownership of additional shares of our common stock. The Board may, in its sole discretion, also exempt any person from triggering the Protection Plan.\nRisks relating to our common stock\nOur stock price is subject to volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so. The market price of our common stock may continue to be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations and court rulings and trends in our industry;\n\u2022\nTinuum Group\u2019s ability to lease or sell RC facilities;\n\u2022\nannouncements of sales awards;\n\u2022\nchanges in supply and demand of components and materials;\n\u2022\nadoption of new tax regulations or accounting standards affecting our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nperceptions of the value of corporate transactions;\n\u2022\nour ability to continue to be able to pay cash dividends;\n\u2022\nthe number of shares of common stock repurchased under stock repurchase programs; and\n\u2022\nthe degree of trading liquidity in our common stock and general market conditions.\nFrom January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018, the closing price of our common stock ranged from $6.98 to $12.08 per share. In June 2017, we commenced a quarterly cash dividend program and have paid out cash dividends in each succeeding quarter through December 31, 2018. In 2017 and 2018, we executed stock repurchases in various forms that included a modified Dutch Auction tender offer in May 2017 and two stock repurchase programs in December 2017 and October 2018. During 2017 and 2018, we repurchased a total of 4,064,188 shares of our common stock for cash of $41.7 million.\nStock price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase shares of our common stock to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. We believe our stock price should reflect expectations of future growth and profitability. Future dividends are subject to declaration by the Board, and under our current stock repurchase program, we are not obligated to acquire any specific number of shares. If we fail to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends, stock repurchases or other market expectations, our stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain additional capital, investor confidence and employee retention, and could reduce the liquidity of our common stock.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends at all or in any particular amounts.\nThe Board first approved a $0.25 per share of common stock quarterly dividend in June 2017. During 2017 and 2018, we declared quarterly dividends in the aggregate amount of $36.1 million. We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability, compliance with debt covenants and periodic determinations by the Board that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends by us.\nThe payment of future dividends may also be affected by, among other factors, compliance with debt covenants, our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in acquisitions; legal risks; stock repurchase programs; changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws; changes to our business model; and our increased interest and principal payments required by the Senior Term Loan and any additional indebtedness that we may incur in the future.\nUnder covenants in the Senior Term Loan, annual collective dividends and repurchases of our common stock in the aggregate may not exceed $30 million, and shall be permitted so long as (a) no default or event of default exists under the Senior Term Loan and (b) expected future net cash flows from the refined coal business as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter exceed $100 million. Based on our current forecasts, we anticipate that future net cash flows from the refined coal business will be below the $100 million minimum requirement as of the third fiscal quarter of 2020, which would preclude us from paying dividends or repurchasing our common stock at that time.\nOur dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends at all or in any particular amounts. A reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover attempt of us.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders. These include provisions that:\n\u2022\nLimit the business at special meetings to the purpose stated in the notice of the meeting;\n\u2022\nAuthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, which is preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede a takeover attempt and that the Board can create and issue without prior stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nEstablish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the Board and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting; and\n\u2022\nRequire the affirmative vote of the \"disinterested\" holders of a majority of our common stock to approve certain business combinations involving an \"interested stockholder\" or its affiliates, unless either minimum price criteria or procedural requirements are met, or the transaction is approved by a majority of our \"continuing directors\" (known as \"fair price provisions\").\nThese provisions, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our common stock, or could limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interest.\nWe may require additional funding for our growth plans, and such funding may require us to issue additional shares of our common stock, resulting in a dilution of your investment.\nWe estimate our funding requirements in order to implement our growth plans. If the funding requirements required to implement growth plans should exceed these estimates significantly or if we come across opportunities to grow through expansion plans which cannot be predicted at this time, and our funds generated from our operations prove insufficient for such purposes, we may need to raise additional funds to meet these funding requirements.\nThese additional funds may be raised by issuing equity or debt securities or by borrowing from banks or other resources. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we fail to obtain additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, we will not be able to implement such plans fully. Such financing even if obtained, may be accompanied by conditions that limit our ability to pay dividends or require us to seek lenders\u2019 consent for payment of dividends, or restrict our freedom to operate our business by requiring lender\u2019s consent for certain corporate actions. Further, if we raise additional funds through the issuance of new shares of our common stock, any shareholders who are unable or unwilling to participate in such an additional round of fund raising may suffer dilution of their investment.", "PERMNO": 90400, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "ADES"}
