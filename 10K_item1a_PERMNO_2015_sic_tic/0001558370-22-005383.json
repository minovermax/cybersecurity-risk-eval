RISK FACTORS.\nOur business is challenged by a changing environment that involves many known and unknown risks and uncertainties. The risks described below discuss factors that have affected and/or could affect us in the future. There may be others. We may be affected by risks that are currently unknown to us or are immaterial at this time. If any such events did occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in a material manner. Our future results may also be impacted by other risk factors listed from time to time in our future filings with the SEC, including, but not limited to, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. As the most significant portion of our consolidated entity is represented by the power industry services reportable business segment, the risk factor discussions included below are focused on that business. However, as a large number of these same risks exist for our other reportable segments, (1) industrial fabrication and field services, and (2) telecommunications infrastructure services, a review and assessment of the following risk factors should be performed with that in mind.\nThis section of our 2022 Annual Report may include projections, assumptions and beliefs that are intended to be \u201cforward looking statements.\u201d They should be read in light of our cautionary statement regarding \u201cforward looking statements\u201d that is presented in Item 7 of this 2022 Annual Report.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nDemand for our services may decrease during economic downturns or unpredictable economic cycles, which would most likely affect our businesses adversely.\nSubstantial portions of the revenues and profits earned by our reportable business segments are generated from construction-type projects, the awarding and/or funding of which we do not directly control. The engineering and construction industry historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in the levels of construction activity due to economic recessions, downturns in the business cycles of project owners, material shortages, price increases by subcontractors, interest rate fluctuations, and other economic factors beyond our control. When the general level of economic activity deteriorates, the level of uncertainty about future business prospects rises. When this occurs, customers may delay or cancel new projects, maintenance on major power plant components, repairs to damaged or worn equipment or other plant outage work. The adverse financial condition of the industry could negatively affect our customers and their willingness to fund capital expenditures or other major projects in the future. Economic, regulatory and market conditions affecting our specific customers may adversely impact the demand for our services, resulting in the delay, reduction or cancellation of certain projects on which our forecasts of future business may depend.\nFuture revenues are dependent on the awards of new EPC projects to us, the receipt of corresponding full notices-to-proceed and our ability to successfully complete the projects that we start.\nThe majority of our consolidated revenues relate to performance by the power industry services segment which represented 78%, 81% and 57% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively. Due primarily to the generally favorable operating results of GPS, the major business component of this segment, we have generated consolidated net income for eleven of the last twelve years. GPS earns the substantial portion of its revenues from execution on long-term EPC services contracts with project owners.\nRevenues of this segment increased by 25% to $398.1 million for Fiscal 2022 from revenues of $319.4 million for Fiscal 2021. This segment reported income from operations in the amount of $44.7 million for Fiscal 2022 compared with a corresponding amount of $30.6 million for Fiscal 2021, an increase of approximately 46%.\n- 13 -\nFor Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, a majority portion of consolidated revenues related to EPC services provided to a single power industry service customer on a project that is scheduled to be substantially completed during the second half of Fiscal 2023. During the period from Fiscal 2019 to the end of Fiscal 2021, GPS was awarded EPC services contracts for the construction of seven combined cycle, gas-fired power plants with an aggregate value of approximately $3.0 billion. However, we have received a full notice to proceed for only one of these EPC projects, a second project for the construction of a natural gas-fired power plant in West Virginia was cancelled during Fiscal 2021 by the project owner, and a third power plant project, located in Virginia, was recently cancelled by its owner.\nOur ability to sustain revenues depends on many factors including the ability of the power industry services business to not only win the awards of significant new EPC projects, but to obtain the corresponding full notices-to-proceed and to complete its projects successfully. There is always a possibility that one or more of the pending EPC services projects will not be built. Should we fail to commence construction activities during Fiscal 2023 on one or more of the major projects included in our current group of awarded contracts or on a newly awarded contract, the growth in revenues and profits that we expect for Fiscal 2023 will be adversely affected.\nOur dependence on large construction contracts may result in uneven financial results.\nOur power industry service activities in any one fiscal reporting period are concentrated on a limited number of large construction projects for which we recognize revenues over time as we transfer control of the project asset to the customer. To a substantial extent, our contract revenues are based on the amounts of costs incurred. As the timing of equipment purchases, subcontractor services and other contract events may not be evenly distributed over the terms of our contracts, the amount of total contract costs may vary from quarter to quarter, creating uneven amounts of quarterly and/or annual consolidated revenues. In addition, the timing of contract commencements and completions may exacerbate the uneven pattern. As a result of the foregoing, future reported amounts of consolidated revenues, cash flow from operations, net income and earnings per share may vary in an uneven pattern and may not be indicative of the operating results expected for any other fiscal period, thus rendering consecutive quarter comparisons of our consolidated operating results a less meaningful way to assess the growth of our business.\nActual results could differ from the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our consolidated financial statements.\nTo prepare consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., we are required to make estimates, assumptions and judgments as of the date of such financial statements, which affect the reported values of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. For each of our fixed price customer contracts, we recognize revenues over the life of the contract as performance obligations are completed by us based on the proportion of costs incurred to date compared to the total costs estimated to be incurred for the entire project, and by using the resulting percentage to update the recorded amounts of project-to-date revenues. We review and make necessary revisions to the amounts of estimated future costs on a monthly basis. In addition, contract results may be impacted by our estimates of the amounts of change orders that we expect to receive and our assessment of any contract disputes that may arise.\nThe effects on revenues of changes to the amounts of contract values and estimated costs typically will be recorded as catch-up adjustments when the amounts are known and can be reasonably estimated. These revisions can occur at any time and could be material. Given the uncertainties associated with the types of customer contracts that we are awarded, it is possible for contract values and actual costs to vary from estimates previously made, which may result in reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenues and profits.\nAmong the other areas currently requiring significant estimates by our management are the following:\n\u25cf the assessment of the value of goodwill and recoverability of other purchased intangible assets;\n\u25cf the determination of provisions for income taxes, the accounting for uncertain income tax positions and the establishment of valuation allowances associated with deferred income tax assets;\n\u25cf the determination of the fair value of stock-based incentive awards; and\n\u25cf accruals for estimated liabilities, including warranties and any losses related to legal matters.\nOur actual business and financial results could differ from our estimates, which may impact future profits.\n- 14 -\nProject backlog amounts may be uncertain indicators of future revenues as project realization may be subject to unexpected adjustments, delays and cancellations.\nAt January 31, 2022, the total value of our project backlog for all of our business units was $0.7 billion. Project cancellations or scope modifications may occur that could reduce the amount of our project backlog and the associated revenues and profits that we actually earn. Projects that are awarded to us may remain included in our backlog for extended periods of time as customers experience project delays. Should any unexpected delay, suspension or termination of the work under such contracts occur, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. We cannot guarantee that revenues projected by us based on our project backlog at January 31, 2022 will be recognized or will result in profitable operating results.\nIn March 2018, GPS entered into an EPC services contract to build a 500 MW natural gas-fired power plant in North Carolina that was added to project backlog at that time. However, due to customer delays including a grid connection dispute, contract activities have not started and we removed this project from backlog during Fiscal 2021. In May 2019, GPS entered into the EPC services contract to construct a 625 MW power plant in Harrison County, West Virginia. As a limited notice-to-proceed with certain preliminary activities was received from the owner of this project at the time, the value of the contract was added to our project backlog where it remains as of January 31, 2022. However, meaningful construction activities for the facility are not likely to begin until financial close is achieved which may not occur.\nUnsuccessful efforts to develop energy plant projects could result in write-offs and the loss of future business.\nThe development of a power plant construction project is expensive with a total cost that could approximate or exceed $10 million. The developers of power projects may form single purpose entities, such as limited liability companies, limited partnerships or joint ventures, to perform the development activities, which are often funded by outside sources. We periodically see business opportunities where we consider providing financial support to the ownership of a new project, typically during the development phase, in order to improve the probability of an EPC contract being awarded to us.\nIn the past, we have been successful in lending funds to single purpose entities formed to develop gas-fired power plants. Each successful involvement resulted in repayment of the loans to us and, more critically, the award to us of the EPC contracts for the construction of the corresponding plant. In addition, the completed development efforts resulted in our receipt of success fees that have exceeded $29.6 million in the aggregate. There can be no assurances that we will benefit from the successful development of these projects or others that may arise in the future.\nOther project development support efforts have not been successful, resulting in the write-off of loan and interest balances, and the loss of the potential construction project. For example, we supported the development efforts for the 1,740 MW Chickahominy gas-fired power plant in the Commonwealth of Virginia including funding provided under development loans and other forms of credit support. Significant development milestones were achieved by the project owner. However, in February 2022, PJM received notice from FERC accepting PJM\u2019s termination of the interconnection service agreement, effectively removing the new power plant from PJM\u2019s planning queue, as the project owner has been unable to secure a fuel-supply for the plant and to obtain the necessary equity financing for the project. The repayment of the development loans is overdue and our efforts to foreclose on the defaulted debt in an orderly fashion have been rejected. We believe that the completion of the development of this project has become significantly jeopardized and that it is doubtful that construction of this power plant will occur. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022, we recorded an impairment loss related to the capitalized project development costs of this project in the amount of $7.9 million, of which $2.5 million was attributed to the non-controlling interest. In March 2022, the project owner made a public announcement of the cancellation of the project.\nAs discussed above, during Fiscal 2021, we removed the value of a gas-fired power plant EPC services contract from project backlog. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022, we wrote off the balance of notes receivable and the related accrued interest, in the total amount of $1.8 million, associated with the project.\nThe future failure of owners to complete the development of power plants could result in the loss of potential construction business for us and could result in additional write-off adjustments related to the balance of any project development costs or amounts lent or credit extended to potential project owners. Further, our failure to obtain the opportunity to support future power plant development projects and the potential to build the associated power plants could be detrimental to future growth. Large unfavorable adjustments related to current and/or future developmental projects could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for a future reporting period.\n- 15 -\nFuture bonding requirements may adversely affect our ability to compete for new energy plant construction projects.\nOur construction contracts frequently require that we obtain payment and performance bonds from surety companies on behalf of project owners as a condition to the contract award. Historically, we have had a strong bonding capacity. However, under standard terms, surety companies issue bonds on a project-by-project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing any bonds. Not all of our projects require bonding. As of January 31, 2022, the estimated value of future work covered by outstanding performance bonds was approximately $235 million.\nMarket conditions, changes in our performance or financial position, changes in our surety\u2019s assessment of its own operating and financial risk or larger future projects could cause our surety company to decline to issue, or substantially reduce, the amount of bonding available for our work and/or could increase our bonding costs. These actions can be taken on short notice. If our surety company were to limit or eliminate our access to new bonds, our alternatives would include seeking bonding capacity from other surety companies, joint venturing with other construction firms, increasing business with clients that do not require bonds and posting other forms of collateral for project performance, such as letters of credit, or cash. We may be unable to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. Accordingly, if we were to experience an interruption, reduction or other alteration in the availability of bonding capacity, we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects.\nOur results could be adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and other adverse weather conditions; or other catastrophic events such as global pandemics could disrupt our operations, or the operations of one or more of our vendors or customers. In particular, these types of events could shut-down our construction job sites or fabrication facilities for indefinite periods of time, break our product supply chain from the impacted region or could cause our customers to delay or cancel projects, which could impact our ability to operate. To the extent any of these events occur, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.\nAs the COVID-19 outbreak became a global pandemic during Fiscal 2021, it challenged our ability to conduct operations normally in the U.S., Ireland and the U.K., because sustained labor productivity at our job sites is essential to the achievement of successful projects. In addition, the Company and certain of our major original equipment manufacturers source certain supplies, materials and equipment from countries afflicted by the outbreak. Future project interruptions or delays in the delivery of major power plant components that are related to a renewed spreading of an existing or mutated strain of the COVID-19 virus could impact our schedules, thereby affecting our ability to complete our fixed-price contract projects in accordance with current schedules. We have protections in our contracts with major customers that provide certain relief that helps to mitigate certain financial risks. However, the effectiveness of these protections may be limited by factors including the financial strength of the customer.\nWe are actively attempting to manage the project risks presented by the current pandemic. However, due to the uncertainty regarding the duration and extent of the global COVID-19 outbreak, the ultimate extent of the operational and financial impacts on us will depend on how long and how disperse the disruptions unfavorably effect our customers, our supply chains and our labor forces. As a result, the ultimate impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on our businesses are not quantifiable at this time.\nThe war in the Ukraine may result in adverse effects on our business.\nAlthough the fighting in this war has been limited to the country of Ukraine, the adverse effects of the war are spreading globally. For example, the concerns about disruptions to the world-wide supply of oil have contributed to the upward pressure on the market price for a barrel of oil, which temporarily soared past $100 per barrel. In our country, the impact has driven the average price of gasoline to over $4.00/gallon, and in California the average price of gasoline exceeds $6.00/gallon. The prolonged interruption of the supply of oil and natural gas by Russia to Western European nations may result in adverse effects to the economies of those countries. Global supply chains, which have already been disrupted by the far-reaching effects of the COVID-19 epidemic, may suffer future damage if the Ukrainian war escalates. We observe that the eventual rebuilding of infrastructure and other facilities within Ukraine may directly challenge the ability of western European companies to obtain of steel, components for electrical cable and other building supplies.\n- 16 -\nIt is too early to assess the extent or length of any adverse effects of the war in the Ukraine on our ability to control contract costs and schedules. Such unfavorable effects may adversely impact our business, particularly the results of operations that we are currently forecasting for Fiscal 2023.\nRisks Related to Our Market\nContinued disruption of base residual auction schedules may delay the start of planned power projects.\nWe have maintained that the delays in new business awards to GPS and the project construction starts of certain previously awarded projects relate to a variety of factors, especially in the northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. Currently, we believe that the ability of the owners of otherwise fully developed gas-fired power plant projects to close on equity and permanent debt financing has been challenged by uncertainty in the capital markets caused by multiple factors including delayed base residual, or \u201ccapacity\u201d auctions. For new power projects, lack of visibility regarding future capacity revenue streams complicates the search for equity and debt financing considerably. Most of our recently completed and awarded EPC service contracts relate to the construction of natural gas-fired power plants located within the geographic footprint of the electric power system operated by PJM. This entity operates a capacity market which is a process to ensure long-term grid reliability by securing the appropriate amount of power supply resources needed to meet predicted future energy demands. A capacity auction for a particular delivery year is usually held during the month of May, three years prior to the actual delivery year.\nPJM\u2019s 2022/2023 capacity auction was originally scheduled to be held in May 2019, but was postponed until May 2021 as PJM waited for the approval by the FERC of new capacity market rules governing offered prices. PJM then intended to hold subsequent auctions on an accelerated basis, approximately every six months, through 2024, so that the regular annual auction routine could then resume in May 2024. However, the next auction, scheduled for December 2021, was postponed until January 2022 and then was postponed again until June 2022. The next three capacity auction dates have been pushed out by 8 to 9 months.\nOur commencement of new EPC power plant projects may continue to be delayed until the visibility regarding future capacity revenue streams is restored by the future announcements of capacity prices in the PJM region.\nLow electricity capacity market prices in the U.S. may discourage future investment in new gas-fired power plant development.\nThe results for the most recent PJM capacity auction that did occur (posted in May 2021) for the delivery year 2022-2023 included a general clearing price that decreased by more than 60% from the corresponding price for the previous year. It represents the lowest general clearing price since the 2013/2014 delivery year. If clearing prices for future capacity auctions, when they occur, resume their fall in the U.S., power plant developers may be discouraged from commencing the development and construction of new power plants which would adversely impact our business.\nIf the price of natural gas increases, the demand for our construction services could decline.\nThe overall growth of our power business has been substantially based on the number of combined cycle gas-fired power plants built by us, as many coal-fired plants have been shut down. In 2010, coal-fired power plants accounted for about 45% of total electricity generation. For 2021, coal accounted for approximately 22% of net electricity generation. On the other hand, natural-gas fired power plants provided approximately 38% of the electricity generated by utility-scale power plants in the U.S. in 2021, representing an increase of 60% from the amount of electrical power generated by natural gas-fired power plants in 2010, which provided approximately 24% of net electricity generation for 2010. The use of coal as a power source has been adversely affected significantly by the plentiful supply of inexpensive natural gas that is available through the combined use of fracturing and horizontal drilling.\nHowever, the share of electricity generation provided by natural gas is particularly reactive in the short term to changing natural gas prices. Due primarily to an increase in gas prices, the use of natural gas as a source of electricity generation at utility scale power plants declined by 3% during 2021. On the other hand, the use of coal as an electricity generation source increased by 16%. Higher than expected natural gas prices, even for just the short term, could have adverse effects on the ability of independent power producers to obtain construction and permanent financing for new natural gas-fired power plants.\n- 17 -\nSoft demand for electrical power may cause deterioration in our financial outlook.\nThe recently published government reference-case energy outlook for the U.S. projects average increases to utility-scale electricity generation of slightly less than 1% per year from 2022 through 2050. For calendar year 2021, the total amount of electricity generated by utility-scale power plants increased by 2.7% as the U.S. economy recovered from the worst effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Any future softness in the demand for electrical power in the U.S. due to any additional adverse impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak, or any other reason, could result in the delay, curtailment or cancellation of future gas-fired power plant projects, thus decreasing the overall demand for our EPC services and adversely impacting the financial outlook for our power industry services business.\nIntense global competition for engineering, procurement and construction contracts could reduce our market share.\nThe competitive landscape in the EPC services market for natural gas-fired power plants has changed significantly over the last few years. Several significant competitors announced their exit from the market for a variety of reasons. Others have announced intentions to avoid entering into fixed-price contracts citing the disproportionate financial risks born by contractors. However, the market remains dynamic, and competitors include multi-billion-dollar companies with thousands of employees. Competing effectively in our market requires substantial financial resources, the availability of skilled personnel and equipment when needed and the effective use of technology. Meaningful competition is expected to continue in the domestic market, and could increase in the Irish and British markets, presenting us with significant challenges to our achieving strong growth rates and acceptable profit margins. If we are unable to meet these competitive challenges and to win the awards of new projects that provide desirable margins, we could lose market share to our competitors, experience overall reductions in future revenues and profits or incur losses.\nThe continuous rise in renewables could reduce the number of future gas-fired power plant projects.\nThe net amount of electricity generation in the U.S. provided by utility-scale wind and solar photovoltaic facilities continues to rise. Over the last two years, the net generation has increased by 34.8%. Together, such power facilities provided approximately 8.8%, 10.6% and 11.9% of the net amount of electricity generated by utility-scale power facilities in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. In the 2022 reference case of the Energy Information Administration (\u201cEIA\u201d), net electricity generation from all renewable power sources is expected to represent over 44% of such generation by 2050. Impetus for this growth has been provided by various factors including laws and regulations that discourage new fossil-fuel burning power plants, environmental activism, income tax advantages that promote the growth of wind and solar power, the decline in the costs of renewable power plant components and power storage, and the increase in the scale of energy storage capacity. Should the pace of development for renewable energy facilities, including wind and solar power plants, accelerate at faster rates than projected, the number of future natural gas-fired construction project opportunities for us may fall, which could adversely affect our future revenues, profits and cash flows.\nThe failure to obtain utility-scale renewable projects could have adverse effects on our growth.\nAs indicated above, the pace of renewable utility-scale power plant additions in the U.S. is growing. The environmentalist opposition against coal-fired power generation has expanded meaningfully and effectively to target all fossil fuel energy projects, including power plants and pipelines, and has evolved into powerful support for renewable energy sources.\nDespite our commitment to the construction of state-of-the-art, natural gas-fired power plants as important elements of our country\u2019s electricity-generation mix in the future, we are directing a meaningful portion of our business development efforts to winning projects for the erection of utility-scale wind farms and solar fields and for the construction of other renewable energy projects. If we expect our power industry business to achieve sustained future growth, it is likely that such growth will depend, in a meaningful way, on our ability to capture a portion of the construction market for renewable power plants that is significant to us. We have successfully built utility-scale wind and solar farms, biomass fueled power plants and biodiesel energy facilities in the past and we have renewed the pursuit of renewable energy projects that will complement our natural gas-fired EPC services projects as a core business development focus going forward.\nIn May 2021, we announced that GPS entered into an EPC services contract to construct the Maple Hill Solar energy facility in Pennsylvania. This project will be constructed using over 235,000 photovoltaic modules to generate approximately 100 MW of electricity.\n- 18 -\nFailure to obtain future awards for the construction of renewable energy facilities, in particular the erection of substantial wind farms and solar-powered utility-scale power projects like the Maple Hill Solar project, could have adverse effects on our future revenues, profits and cash flows.\nUnexpected and adverse changes in the foreign countries in which we operate could result in project disruptions, increased cost and potential losses.\nOur business is also subject to international economic and political conditions that change for reasons which are beyond our control. Such changes may have unfavorable consequences for us. Operating in the international marketplace, which for us exists primarily in Ireland and the U.K., may expose us to a number of risks including:\n\u2022 abrupt changes in domestic and/or foreign government policies, laws, treaties (including those impacting trade), regulations or leadership;\n\u2022 embargoes or other trade restrictions, including sanctions;\n\u2022 restrictions on currency movement;\n\u2022 tax or tariff increases;\n\u2022 currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022 changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; and\n\u2022 other social, political and economic instability.\nOur level of exposure to these risks will vary on each significant project we perform overseas, depending on the location and the particular stage of the project. To the extent that our international business is affected by unexpected and adverse foreign economic changes, including trade retaliation from certain countries, we may experience project disruptions and losses which could significantly reduce our consolidated revenues and profits, or could cause losses reflected at the consolidated level.\nRisks Related to the Regulatory Environment\nWe are required to comply with environmental laws and regulations that may add unforeseen costs to our business.\nOur operations are subject to compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to discharges to air, water and land, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and the cleanup of properties affected by hazardous substances. Certain environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance and others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, impose strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability upon persons responsible for releases of hazardous substances. We continually evaluate whether we must take additional steps to ensure compliance with environmental laws, however, there can be no assurance that these requirements will not change and that compliance will not add costs to our projects that could adversely affect our operating results in the future.\nThe election of President Biden has resulted in additional regulatory hurdles for fossil-fuel energy facilities.\nA significant headwind for future gas-fired power plant developments relates to the policies of President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., who has proposed to make the electricity production in the U.S. carbon free by 2035 and to put the country on the path to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Since he has taken office, President Biden has caused the U.S. to re-join the Paris climate agreement. He has denied permission for the Keystone Pipeline to cross the U.S.-Canadian border. He has issued an executive order temporarily suspending new oil and gas leasing on federal lands. One additional element of his plan is to ban fracking on federal land. However, as about 90% of fracking occurs on state or private lands, the vast majority of fracking will be unaffected. There may be practical, political and legal hurdles in Mr. Biden\u2019s path, but his election, in part, does represent an indication that public sentiment against fossil-fuel sourced energy is growing rapidly, which may create future obstacles for fossil fuel-based energy facility developers to obtain the permits necessary for the start of construction activities.\nFuture construction projects may depend on the continuing acceptability of the hydraulic fracturing process in certain states.\nThe viability of the gas-fired power plants that we build is based substantially on the availability of inexpensive natural gas supplies provided through the use of hydraulic fracturing (\u201cfracking\u201d) combined with horizontal drilling techniques. Certain technological advancements led to the widespread use of fracking and horizontal drilling enabling drillers to reach\n- 19 -\nnatural gas and oil deposits previously trapped within shale rock formations deep under the earth\u2019s surface. The access to new oil and gas reserves transformed the oil and gas industry in the U.S. In particular, the new supplies of natural gas generally lowered the price of natural gas in the U.S. and reduced its volatility, making the operation of natural gas-fired power plants more economically appealing. However, the process of fracking uses large volumes of highly pressurized water to break-up the shale rock formations and to free the trapped natural gas and oil. This process is controversial due to concerns about the disposal of the waste water, the possible contamination of nearby water supplies and the risk of potential seismic events.\nShould future evidence confirm the concerns or should a major contamination or seismic episode occur in the future, the use of fracking may be suspended, limited, or curtailed by additional state and/or federal authorities. As a result, the supply of inexpensive natural gas may not be available in the future and the economic viability of gas-fired power plants may be jeopardized. A reduction in the pace of the construction of new gas-fired power plants would have a significantly adverse effect on our future operating results.\nThe inability of power project developers to receive or to avoid delay in receiving the applicable regulatory approvals relating to energy projects, including new natural gas pipelines, may result in lost or postponed revenues for us.\nThe commencement and/or execution of the types of projects performed by our power industry services reporting segment are subject to numerous regulatory permitting processes. Applications for the variety of clean air, water purity and construction permits may be opposed by individuals or environmental groups, resulting in delays and possible denial of the permits. There are no assurances that our project owner customers will obtain the necessary permits for these projects, or that the necessary permits will be obtained in order to allow construction work to proceed as scheduled. Failure to commence or complete construction work as anticipated could have material adverse impacts on our future revenues, profits and cash flows.\nIn particular, the viability of new natural gas-fired power plants depends on the availability of nearby sources of natural gas for fuel which may require the construction of new pipelines for the delivery of gas to a power plant location. A planned plant may also depend on the erection of transmission lines for the delivery of the newly generated electricity to the grid. Concerns about climate change have resulted in increased environmental activism that represents opposition to the regulatory approval of any fossil-fuel energy project. As a result, approval delays and public opposition to new oil and gas pipelines have become major potential hurdles for the developers of gas-fired power plants and other fossil fuel facilities. The slowdown in permitting processes is due, at least in part, to the increase in environmental activism that garners media attention and fosters public skepticism about new projects. In particular, pipeline projects are delayed by onsite protest demonstrations, indecision by local officials and lawsuits.\nWork stoppages, union negotiations and other labor problems could adversely affect us.\nThe performance of certain large-scale construction contracts results in the hiring of employees represented by labor unions. We do make sincere efforts to maintain favorable relationships and conduct good-faith negotiations with union officials. However, there can be no assurances that such efforts will eliminate the possibilities of unfavorable conflicts in the future. A lengthy strike or the occurrence of other work disputes, slowdowns or stoppages at any of our current or future construction project sites could have an adverse effect on us, resulting in cost overruns, schedule delays or even lawsuits that could be significant. In addition, labor incidents could result in negative publicity for us thereby damaging our business reputation and perhaps harming our prospects for the receipt of future construction contract awards in certain locales.\nRisks Related to Our Operational Execution\nWe may experience reduced profits or incur losses under fixed price contracts if costs increase above estimates.\nPrimarily, our business is performed under long-term, fixed price contracts at prices that reflect our estimates of corresponding costs and schedules. Inaccuracies in these estimates may lead to cost overruns that may not be paid by our project owner customers. If we fail to accurately estimate the resources required and time necessary to complete these types of contracts, or if we fail to complete these contracts within the costs and timeframes to which we have agreed, there could be material adverse impacts on our actual financial results, the accuracy of forecasted future results, as well as our business reputation.\n- 20 -\nFactors not discussed above that could result in contract cost overruns, project delays or other problems for us may include:\n\u25cf delays in the scheduled deliveries of machinery and equipment ordered by us or a project owner (i.e., supply chain disruptions);\n\u25cf unanticipated technical problems, including design or engineering issues;\n\u25cf inadequate project execution tools for recording, tracking, forecasting and controlling future costs and schedules;\n\u25cf unforeseen increases in the costs of labor, warranties, raw materials, components or equipment, or our failure or inability to obtain resources when needed;\n\u25cf reliance on historical cost and/or execution data that is not representative of current conditions;\n\u25cf delays or productivity issues caused by weather conditions, or other forces majeure (i.e., pandemics);\n\u25cf incorrect assumptions related to labor productivity, scheduling estimates or future economic conditions, including the impacts of inflation on fixed-price contracts;\n\u25cf workmanship deficiencies resulting in delays and costs associated with the performance by us of unanticipated rework; and\n\u25cf modifications to projects that create unanticipated costs or delays.\nThese risks tend to be exacerbated for longer-term contracts because there is increased risk that the circumstances under which we based our original cost estimates or project schedules will change with a resulting increase in costs or delays in achieving scheduled milestones. In such events, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted. For example, most of our work on the TeesREP project in the U.K. was performed pursuant to a fixed-price subcontract. The loss incurred on the project by APC and recorded during Fiscal 2020 was approximately $29.5 million.\nWe try to mitigate these risks by reflecting in our overall cost estimates the reasonable possibility that a number of different and potentially unfavorable outcomes might occur. There are no assurances that our estimates will be sufficient. If not, our misjudgments may lead to decreased profits or losses. In some cases, as certain risk scenarios are eliminated or our concerns regarding certain potential cost and/or schedule issues diminish, we may estimate that the likelihood of an unforeseen cost overrun has reduced and, accordingly, we may increase the estimated gross margin on the project by decreasing the remaining overall cost estimate.\nIf we guarantee the timely completion or the performance of a project, we could incur additional costs to fulfill such obligations.\nIn many of our fixed price long-term contracts, we guarantee that we will complete a project by a scheduled date. We sometimes provide that the project, when completed, will also achieve certain performance standards. Subsequently, we may fail to complete the project on time or equipment that we install may not meet guaranteed performance standards. In those cases, we may be held responsible for costs incurred by the customer resulting from any delay or any modification to the plant made in order to achieve the performance standards, generally in the form of contractually agreed-upon liquidated damages or obligations to re-perform substandard work. If we are required to pay such costs, the total costs of the project would likely exceed our original estimate, and we could experience reduced profits or a loss related to the applicable project.\nWe may be involved in litigation, liability claims and contract disputes which could reduce our profits and cash flows.\nWe build large and complex energy plants where design, construction or systems failures can result in substantial injury or damage to third parties. In addition, the nature of our business results in project owners, subcontractors and vendors occasionally presenting claims against us for recovery of costs that they incurred in excess of what they expected to incur, or for which they believe they are not contractually liable. In other cases, project owners may withhold retention and/or contract payments, for which they believe they do not contractually owe us or based on their interpretation of the contract, or even terminate the contract. We have been, are, and may be in the future, named as a defendant in legal proceedings where parties may allege breach of contract and seek recovery for damages or other remedies with respect to our projects or other matters (see Legal Proceedings in Item 3). These legal matters generally arise in the normal course of our business. In addition, from time to time, we and/or certain of our current or former directors, officers or employees may be named as parties to other types of lawsuits.\n- 21 -\nLitigation can involve complex factual and legal questions, and proceedings may occur over several years. As a result, it is typically not possible to predict the likely outcome of legal actions with certainty, but it is likely that any significant lawsuit or other claim against us that involves lengthy legal maneuvering may have a material adverse effect on us regardless of the outcome. Any claim that is successfully asserted against us could result in our payment of significant sums for damages and other losses. Even if we were to prevail, any litigation may be costly and time-consuming, and would likely divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations over multi-year periods. Either outcome may result in adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our reputation.\nIn accordance with customary industry practices, we maintain insurance coverage against some, but not all, potential losses in order to protect against the risks we face. When it is determined that we have liability, we may not be covered by insurance or, if covered, the dollar amount of any liability may exceed our policy limits or self-insurance reserves. Further, we may elect not to carry insurance related to particular risks if our management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, we cannot insure fully against pollution and environmental risks. Our management liability insurance policies are on a \u201cclaims-made\u201d basis covering only claims actually made during the policy period currently in effect. In addition, even where insurance is maintained for such exposures, the policies have deductibles resulting in our assuming exposure for a layer of coverage with respect to any such claims. Any liability not covered by our insurance, in excess of our insurance limits and self-insurance reserves or, if covered by insurance but subject to a high deductible, could result in a significant loss for us, which claims may reduce our future profits and cash available for operations.\nOur failure to recover adequately on contract variations submitted to project owners could have a material effect on our financial results.\nWe may submit contract variations to project owners for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. For example, in January 2019, we filed a lawsuit against a project owner for breach of contract and failure to remedy various conditions which negatively affected the schedule and costs associated with the construction of a gas-fired power plant. This matter was resolved during Fiscal 2022. Variations occur due to matters such as owner-caused delays or changes from the initial project scope, both of which may result in additional costs. At times, contract variation submissions can be the subject of lengthy arbitration or litigation proceedings, and it is difficult to accurately predict when these differences will be fully resolved. When these types of events occur and unresolved matters are pending, we have used existing liquidity to cover cost overruns pending their resolution. The aggregate amounts of contract variations included in the transaction prices that were used to determine project-to-date revenues for all of our projects at January 31, 2022 and 2021 were $7.5 million and $16.6 million, respectively. A failure to promptly recover on these types of customer submissions could have a negative impact on our liquidity and profitability in the future.\nThe shortage of skilled craft labor may negatively impact our ability to execute on our long-term construction contracts.\nIncreased infrastructure spending and general economic expansion may increase the demand for employees with the types of skills needed for the completion of our projects. There is a risk that our construction project schedules become unachievable or that labor expenses will increase unexpectedly as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel available to us. Labor shortages, productivity decreases or increased labor costs could impair our ability to maintain our business or grow our revenues. The inability to hire and retain qualified skilled employees in the future, including workers in the construction crafts, could negatively impact our ability to complete our long-term construction contracts successfully.\nOur dependence upon third parties to complete many of our contracts may adversely affect our performance under current and future construction contracts.\nCertain of the work performed under our energy plant construction contracts is actually performed by third-party subcontractors we hire. We also rely on third-party manufacturers or suppliers to provide much of the equipment and most of the materials (such as copper, concrete and steel) needed to complete our construction projects. If we are unable to hire qualified subcontractors or to find qualified equipment manufacturers or suppliers, our ability to successfully complete a project could be adversely impacted. If the price we are required to pay for subcontractors or equipment and supplies exceeds the corresponding amount that we have estimated, we may suffer a loss on the contract. If a supplier, manufacturer or subcontractor fails to provide supplies, equipment or services as required under a negotiated contract for any reason, we\n- 22 -\nmay be required to self-perform unexpected work or obtain these supplies, equipment or services on an expedited basis or at a higher price than anticipated from a substitute source, which could impact contract profitability in an adverse manner. Unresolved disputes with a subcontractor or supplier regarding the scope of work or performance may escalate, resulting in arbitration proceedings or legal actions (see \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Item 3 below). Unfavorable outcomes of such disputes may also impact contract profitability in an adverse manner. In addition, if a subcontractor fails to pay its subcontractors, suppliers or employees, liens may be placed on our project requiring us to incur the costs of reimbursing such parties in order to have the liens removed or to commence litigation.\nFailure to maintain safe work sites could result in significant losses as we work on projects that are inherently dangerous.\nWe often work on large-scale and complex projects, sometimes in geographically remote locations. Our project sites can place our employees and others near large and/or mechanized equipment, high voltage electrical equipment, moving vehicles, dangerous processes or highly regulated materials, and in challenging environments. Safety is a primary focus of our business and is critical to our reputation. Often, we are responsible for safety on the project sites where we work. Many of our customers require that we meet certain safety criteria to be eligible to bid on contracts. Further, regulatory changes implemented by OSHA or similar government agencies could impose additional costs on us. We maintain programs with the primary purpose of implementing effective health, safety and environmental procedures throughout our Company. Currently, our project managers are challenged with maintaining work sites and controlling employee behaviors to comply with requirements mandated by national, state and local health officials intended to minimize the spread of the COVID-19 virus. If we fail to implement appropriate safety procedures and/or if our procedures fail, our employees or others may suffer injuries or illness. The failure to comply with such procedures, client contracts or applicable regulations could subject us to losses and liability, and adversely impact our ability to complete awarded projects as planned or to obtain projects in the future. Our OSHA reportable incident rates, weighted by hours worked for all of our subsidiaries, were 0.48, 0.55 and 0.40 for calendars 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our actual rates were significantly better than the national averages in our industry (NAICS - 2379) for those years.\nFuture acquisitions and/or investments may not occur which could limit the growth of our business, and the integration of acquired companies may not be successful.\nArgan is a holding company with current investments in GPS, APC, TRC and SMC. We want to make additional acquisitions and/or investments that would provide positive cash flow to us and value to our stockholders. However, additional companies meeting these criteria and that provide products and/or services in growth industries and that are available for purchase at attractive prices are difficult to find. Discussions with the principal(s) of potential acquisition targets may be protracted and ultimately terminated for a variety of reasons. Further, due diligence investigations of attractive target companies may uncover unfavorable data, and the negotiation and consummation of acquisition agreements may not be successful.\nWe cannot readily predict the timing or size of any future acquisitions or the capital we will need for these transactions. However, it is likely that any potential future acquisition or strategic investment transaction would require the use of cash and/or shares of our common stock as components of the purchase price. Using cash for acquisitions may limit our financial flexibility and make us more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or equity financings. Our ability to obtain such additional financing in the future may depend upon prevailing capital market conditions, the strength of our future operating results and financial condition as well as conditions in our business, and the amount of outside financing sought by us. These factors may affect our efforts to arrange additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us. Our ability to use shares of our common stock as future acquisition consideration may be limited by a variety of factors, including the future market price of shares of our common stock and a potential seller\u2019s assessment of the liquidity of our common stock. If adequate funds or the use of our common stock are not available to us, or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of desirable acquisitions or other investment opportunities that would benefit our business. Even if we do complete acquisitions in the future, acquired companies may fail to achieve the results we anticipate including the expected gross profit percentages.\nIn general, we keep each of our subsidiary operations separate and distinct. However, we do attempt to integrate certain aspects to drive synergies and cost reductions. In the future, we may not be able to successfully integrate such acquired companies with our other operations without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial problems including:\n\u25cf the diversion of management\u2019s attention from other important operational or financial matters;\n- 23 -\n\u25cf the inability to retain or maintain the focus of key personnel of acquired companies;\n\u25cf the discovery of previously unidentified project costs or other liabilities;\n\u25cf unforeseen difficulties encountered in the maintenance of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, including an effective system of internal control over financial reporting; and\n\u25cf impairment losses related to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets.\nCircumstances have caused us to record impairment losses related to the goodwill of TRC and APC in prior years in the aggregate amount of $7.0 million.\nFuture acquisitions could result in issuances of equity securities that would reduce our stockholders\u2019 ownership interests, the issuance of sizable amounts of debt and the incurrence of contingent liabilities. Further, we may conclude that the divestiture of a troubled business will satisfy the best interests of our stockholders. Any divesting transaction could result in a material loss for us.\nIn summary, integrating acquired companies may involves unique and significant risks. Our failure to overcome such risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and future results of operations, and could cause damage to our Company\u2019s reputation.\nOur failure to protect our management information systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur computer systems face the threat of unauthorized access, computer hackers, viruses, malicious code, cyberattacks, phishing and other security incursions and system disruptions, including attempts to improperly access our confidential and proprietary information as well as the confidential and proprietary information of our customers and other business partners. A party who circumvents our security measures, or those of our clients, contractors or other vendors, could misappropriate confidential or proprietary information, improperly manipulate data, or cause damage or interruptions to systems.\nVarious privacy and security laws in the US and abroad, including the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) in the European Union, require us to protect sensitive and confidential information and data from disclosure and we are bound by our client and other contracts, as well as our own business practices, to protect confidential and proprietary information and data (whether it be ours or a third party\u2019s information entrusted to us) from unauthorized disclosure. We believe that we have deployed industry-accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information retained within our information systems, including compliance with GDPR specifically at APC. However, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent unanticipated security breaches. There can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent these threats. Further, as these security threats continue to evolve, we may be required to devote additional resources to protect, prevent, detect and respond against such threats. We do believe that our business represents a low value target for cyberterrorists as we are not a company in the high technology space and we do not maintain large files of sensitive or confidential personal information. However, we do maintain a cybersecurity insurance policy to help protect ourselves from various types of losses relating to computer security breaches.\nWe can report that we are unaware of any other significant security breaches at any of our business locations that occurred during Fiscal 2022. That does not suggest that we may not be victimized by a meaningful breach in the future. Any significant future breach of our information security could damage our reputation, result in litigation and/or regulatory fines and penalties, or have other material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nShould our management information systems become unavailable for any significant period of time, our business could be harmed.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware and software systems. We are heavily reliant on computer, information and communications technology and related systems, some of which are hosted by third party providers, in order to operate effectively. We may experience system availability disruptions that may or may not occur as the result of planned procedures. Unplanned interruptions may include natural disasters, power loss, telecommunications failures, acts of terrorism, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar cybersecurity intrusions as discussed above. Any of these or other events could delay or prevent necessary operations (including the processing of transactions and the reporting of financial results).\n- 24 -\nWhile we believe that our reasonable safeguards will protect us from serious disruptions in the availability of our information technology assets, these safeguards may not be sufficient. We may also be required to expend significant resources to protect against or alleviate damage caused by systems interruptions and delays.\nWe do evaluate the need to upgrade and/or replace our systems and network infrastructure to protect our computing environment, to stay current on vendor-supported products, to improve the efficiency of our systems and for other business reasons. The implementation of new systems and information technology could adversely impact our operations by imposing substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and risks of delays or difficulties in transitioning to new systems. The unavailability of the information systems or the failure of the systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and could result in decreased performance and increased overhead costs, causing our business to suffer. Any significant interruption or failure of our information systems could disrupt the conduct of our business in a meaningful manner, possibly causing adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be subject to increased corporate taxes in the future.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. A change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, in any country where we operate could result in higher tax rates applied to our pre-tax earnings resulting in higher tax amounts. Such higher corporate taxes could result from a resurrected Build-Back-Better Act (or subset thereof) that would likely increase the U.S. corporate tax rate to 25%-28% and perhaps establish a 1% surcharge on corporate stock buy-backs, or the Global Minimum Tax, a recent global agreement to ensure that certain large corporations pay income tax at a minimum rate of 15%. Under this scheme, governments could still set whatever corporate tax rate they want, but if companies pay lower rates in a particular country, their home governments could \u201ctop-off\u201d their taxes to the 15% minimum.\nIn any event, it is likely that we will pay higher U.S. income taxes going forward due to the impact of the Global Intangible Low Tax Income (\u201cGILTI\u201d) rate. GILTI is a federal tax provision that determines the amount of the current earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are included in the computation of the corporate tax of U.S. parent companies. We have avoided this incremental taxation created by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) because our foreign operations have incurred mostly losses since the enactment of the Tax Act in late 2017. However, GILTI may become meaningfully unfavorable to us if our operations in Ireland and the U.K. remain profitable in the future.\nCertain of our tax positions may be successfully challenged by tax authorities which could result in additional income tax expense.\nSignificant judgment is required in order to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes for each quarterly and annual reporting period. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our tax estimates and tax positions could be materially affected by many factors including the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, the introduction of new tax accounting standards, legislation, regulations and related interpretations, our global mix of earnings, the realization of deferred tax assets, changes in uncertain tax positions and changes in our tax strategies.\nThe results of current or future income tax return examinations could result in unfavorable adjustments to the amounts of income taxes previously recorded and/or paid. Any such future event or determination related to income taxes could have a material impact on our net earnings and cash flows from operations.\nThe Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) has issued its revenue agents review reports related to the examination of our amended consolidated federal income tax returns for Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2017, and our consolidated federal income tax return for Fiscal 2018.\nDuring Fiscal 2019, we completed a detailed review of the activities of our engineering staff on major EPC services projects in order to identify and quantify the amounts of estimated research and development tax credits that were available to reduce prior year income taxes. This study focused on project costs incurred during the three-year period ended January 31, 2018. Based on the detailed review, we identified and estimated significant amounts of income tax benefits that were not previously recognized in our operating results for any prior year reporting period.\n- 25 -\nAs a result, we recorded an income tax benefit in the net amount of $16.6 million related to the research and development tax credits during Fiscal 2019, which was subsequently reduced by $0.4 million. The research and development tax credits were included in amendments to our consolidated federal income tax returns for Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2017, that were filed in January 2019, and our consolidated federal income tax return for Fiscal 2018, that was filed in November 2018.\nWe have received reports from the IRS that documents its understanding of the facts, attempts to summarize our arguments in support of the claims and states its position which disagrees with our treatment of a substantial amount of the costs that support the research and development tax credit claims reflected in our amended tax returns for Fiscal 2016 and Fiscal 2017, and our tax return for Fiscal 2018. After a careful review of the reports, we have concluded that our arguments are sound and that the reports do not present any new facts relating to the issues or make any new arguments that would cause us to make any adjustments to our accounting for the research and development tax credit claims as of January 31, 2022 or 2021. We have formally protested the findings of the IRS examiner and intend to pursue our income tax position with the IRS through the established appeals process.\nWe have evaluated our income tax positions using the more-likely-than-not threshold in order to determine the amount of benefits to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. We do not anticipate any significant changes to the net amount of the income tax benefits recorded for research and development tax credits claimed for Fiscal 2016 through Fiscal 2018. However, if negotiations with the IRS or legal decisions cause us to believe that our previously recognized tax positions no longer meet the more-likely-than-not threshold, the related benefit amounts will be derecognized in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met, which could materially and adversely affect our future financial condition and operating results.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010 and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to officials or others for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While we believe that our policies and oversight in this area are strong, we cannot provide assurances that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from the possible reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or others. If we are found to be liable for anti-bribery law violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others including our partners, subcontractors or suppliers), we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Litigation or investigations relating to alleged or suspected violations of anti-bribery laws, even if such litigation or investigations demonstrate ultimately that we did not violate anti-bribery laws, could be costly and could divert management\u2019s attention away from other aspects of our business.\nOur continued success requires us to retain and hire talented personnel.\nUndoubtedly, unforeseen future changes in our management will occur. Therefore, we cannot be certain that any key executive or manager will continue in such capacity while performing at a high level for any particular period of time, nor can we be certain that events will permit us to complete smooth management transitions should they occur. Our ability to operate productively and profitably, particularly in the power industry, is dependent on our ability to attract, employ, retain and train skilled personnel necessary to meet our future requirements. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain experienced management teams and adequately skilled groups of employees necessary to execute our long-term construction contracts successfully and to support our future growth strategy. The loss of key personnel, the inability to complete management transitions without significant loss of effectiveness, or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees in the future could negatively impact our ability to manage our business in the future.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Securities\nOur acquisition strategy may result in dilution to our stockholders.\nWe may make future acquisitions of other businesses that require the use of cash and issuances of common stock. To the extent that we intend to use cash for any acquisition, we may be required to raise additional equity and/or obtain debt financing. Equity financing may result in dilution for our then current stockholders. Stock issuances and financing, if obtained, may not be on terms favorable to us and could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders at the time(s) of these transactions.\n- 26 -\nFuture stock option exercises and restricted stock issuances will dilute the ownership of the Company\u2019s current stockholders.\nAs of January 31, 2022, the closing market price for a share of our common stock was $37.15. The average of the monthly closing prices for our common stock for Fiscal 2022 was $45.70 per share. During Fiscal 2022, the exercise of stock options by our employees and directors resulted in the issuance of 42,000 shares of our common stock at a weighted average purchase price of $34.01 per share. As of January 31, 2022, there were outstanding options to purchase 1,404,901 shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $44.35 per share, including 286,001 shares related to in-the-money exercisable stock options with a weighted average exercise price of $30.79 per share. Future exercises of options to purchase shares of common stock at prices below prevailing market prices will result in ownership dilution for current stockholders.\nFurther, since April 2019, we have awarded performance-based and time-based restricted stock units to executives and other key employees covering up to an aggregate of 222,250 shares of common stock plus a number of shares to be determined based on the amount of cash dividends deemed paid on shares earned pursuant to the awards. The issuance of common stock earned pursuant to performance based restricted stock units will depend primarily on the total shareholder return performance of our common stock measured against the performance of peer-group of common stocks over three-year periods. The three-year period related to the earliest set of awards covering up to 36,000 shares ends in April 2022. The outstanding time-based restricted stock units cover 82,250 shares of our common stock; these awards will fully vest in 2024. The number of shares of our common stock that will ultimately be issued in connection with the restricted stock unit awards is not known. Any issuance will result in the dilution of the stock ownership of current stockholders.\nOur officers, directors and certain unaffiliated stockholders have substantial control over the Company.\nAs of January 31, 2022, our executive officers and directors as a group owned approximately 9.5% of our voting shares including an aggregate of 852,990 shares of common stock that may be purchased upon the exercise of stock options held by our executive officers and directors (and deemed exercisable at January 31, 2022), a total of 349,895 shares of common stock beneficially owned by Rainer H. Bosselmann (our chairman of the board and chief executive officer) and a total of 170,000 shares beneficially owned by William F. Griffin, (a co-founder of GPS and member of our board of directors). An additional 1.8% of the outstanding shares are controlled by Allen & Company entities (\u201cAllen\u201d). One of our independent directors is an officer of Allen. In addition, three (3) other stockholders owned approximately 25.9% of our shares in total as of December 31, 2021. These groups of stockholders may have significant influence over corporate actions such as the election of directors, amendments to our certificate of incorporation, the consummation of any merger, the sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other actions requiring stockholder approval.\nWe may not pay cash dividends in the future.\nOur board of directors evaluates our ongoing operational and financial performance in order to determine what role strategically aligned dividends should play in creating shareholder value. Starting in Fiscal 2019, we have paid regular quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.25 per share of common stock. We also made special cash dividend payments in the amount of $1.00 per share of common stock in July 2020 and December 2020, and we paid regular and special cash dividends during earlier years.\nThere can be no assurance that the evaluations of our board of directors will result in the payment of regular or special cash dividends in the future.\nWe may discontinue the repurchase of our common stock in the future.\nWe began to repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market in November 2021. By January 31, 2022, we repurchased 527,752 shares at an aggregate price of approximately $20.4 million, or $38.60 per share. Since year-end, we have continued to make open market purchases pursuant to the approvals of our board of directors. Such approvals, which permits privately negotiated transactions as well as open market purchases, increased the size of our share repurchase program from $25 million to $75 million and extended the buy-back authorization until January 2024. We can provide no guarantee that we will continue to make common stock repurchases up to the approved amount of $75 million.\n- 27 -\nAs our common stock is thinly traded at times, the stock price may be volatile and investors may have difficulty disposing of their investments at prevailing market prices.\nOur common stock is listed for trading on the NYSE stock exchange and trades under the symbol AGX. Despite the listing on this national stock exchange, our common stock may trade thinly and sporadically at times and no assurances can be given that a larger market will ever develop, or if developed, that it will be maintained.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and Delaware law could deter takeover attempts.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and Delaware law could delay, prevent, or make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us. Among other things, our board of directors may issue up to 500,000 shares of our preferred stock and may determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions, including voting and conversion rights, of these shares. The issuance of preferred stock by us could adversely affect the rights of holders of common stock by, among other factors, establishing dividend rights, liquidation rights and voting rights that are superior to the rights of the holders of the common stock. In addition, Delaware law limits transactions between us and persons that acquire significant amounts of our stock without approval of our board of directors.", "PERMNO": 64785, "SIC": 8711, "TIC": "AGX"}
