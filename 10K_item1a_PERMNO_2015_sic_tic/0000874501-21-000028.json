{"cik": "874501", "company": "AMBAC FINANCIAL GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nCapitalized terms used but not defined in this section shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in Part I, Item 1 in this Form 10-K or in Note 1. Background and Business Description to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K unless otherwise indicated.\nOur risk factors are organized in the following sections.\nRisks Related to AFG Common Shares\nInvestments in AFG's common stock are highly speculative and the price per share of AFG's common stock may be subject to a high degree of volatility, including significant price declines.\nAmbac's principal business is in run-off and faces significant risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. Although AFG's common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\"), there can be no assurance as to the liquidity of the trading market or the price at which such shares can be sold. The price of the shares may decline substantially in response to a number of events or circumstances, including but not limited to:\n\u2022adverse developments in our financial condition or results of operations;\n\u2022actual or perceived adverse developments with regards to AAC's residential mortgage-backed securities (\"RMBS\") litigations;\n\u2022changes in the actual or perceived risk within our FG insured portfolio, particularly with regards to concentrations of credit risk, such as in Puerto Rico;\n\u2022changes to regulatory status;\n\u2022changes in investors\u2019 or analysts\u2019 valuation measures for our stock;\n\u2022market perceptions of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our business strategy;\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 10 2020 FORM 10-K |\n\u2022the impact or perceived impact of any acquisition, disposition or other strategic transaction, including entry into a new line of business, on the value or long-term prospects of the Company; and\n\u2022results and actions of other participants in our industry.\nIn addition, the price of AFG's shares may be affected by the additional risks described below, including risks associated with AAC\u2019s ability to deliver value to AFG. Investments in AFG's common stock should be considered highly speculative and may be subject to a high degree of volatility.\nThe occurrence of certain events could result in the initiation of rehabilitation proceedings against AAC, with resulting adverse consequences to holders of our securities.\nIncreased loss development in the FG insured portfolio or significant losses or other events resulting from litigation, including the failure to achieve expected recoveries from existing litigations concerning insured RMBS, may prompt OCI to determine that it is in the best interests of policyholders to initiate rehabilitation proceedings with respect to AAC, either preemptively or in response to any such event.\nIf OCI were to decide to initiate rehabilitation proceedings with respect to AAC, adverse consequences may result, including, without limitation and absent enforceable protective injunctive relief, the assertion of damages by counterparties, the acceleration of losses based on early termination triggers, and the loss of control rights in insured transactions. Any such consequences may reduce any residual value of AAC. Additionally, the rehabilitator would assume control of all of AAC\u2019s assets and management of AAC. In exercising control, the rehabilitator would act for the benefit of policyholders, and would not take into account the interests of our security holders, which may result in material adverse consequences for our security holders.\nAFG may not be able to realize value from AAC or generate earnings apart from AAC.\nThe value of AFG's common stock is partially dependent upon realizing residual value and/or receiving dividends from AAC; the receipt of payments to be made by AAC pursuant to the intercompany expense sharing and cost allocation agreement (the \"Cost Allocation Agreement\"); the receipt of payments on investments made in surplus notes issued by AAC; and the receipt of payments on other investments. There can be no assurance that AFG will be able to realize residual value and/or receive dividends from AAC, which is in run-off. AFG's ability to realize residual value and/or receive dividends from AAC will depend upon, amongst other considerations, AAC's ability to satisfy all of its obligations that are senior to AFG's equity interests, including obligations to policyholders, holders of its indebtedness (including surplus notes, the Ambac Note and the Tier 2 Notes) and holders of its preferred stock. AAC's ability to satisfy all of its obligations is dependent on a number of considerations including its ability to achieve recoveries and mitigate losses from its insured portfolio, which is subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including as a result of varying potential perceptions of the value of AAC\u2019s guarantees and securities.\nDue to the above considerations, as well as applicable legal and contractual restrictions described elsewhere herein, it is highly unlikely that AAC will be able to pay AFG any dividends for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the payments to be made to AFG under the intercompany Cost Allocation Agreement are subject to, in certain instances, OCI approval, making the amount and timing of such payments uncertain. Specifically, the Cost Allocation Agreement provides that AAC's reimbursement of certain AFG operating expenses is subject to the approval of OCI and limited to $4.0 million per annum. We can provide no assurance as to whether OCI will approve such reimbursement or any portion thereof.\nThe value of AFG's common stock also depends upon the ability of Ambac to generate earnings apart from AAC. As noted below in Risks Related to Strategic Plan, Ambac is exploring further expansion into specialty property and casualty program insurance, managing general agent/underwriter, and potentially other insurance and insurance related businesses that, among other things, may permit utilization of Ambac\u2019s net operating loss carry-forwards, but there are no assurances regarding its ability to acquire or develop any material businesses or the prospects for any such businesses.\nRisks Related to FG Insured Portfolio Losses\nLoss reserves may not be adequate to cover potential losses, and changes in loss reserves may result in further volatility of net income and comprehensive income.\nLoss reserves are established when management has observed credit deterioration in its insured credits. Loss reserves established with respect to our non-derivative financial guarantee insurance policies are based upon estimates and judgments by management, including estimates and judgments with respect to the probability of default; the severity of loss upon default; management\u2019s ability to execute policy commutations, restructurings and other loss mitigation strategies; and estimated remediation recoveries for, among other things, breaches by RMBS issuers of representations and warranties. The objective of establishing loss reserve estimates is not to, and our loss reserves do not, reflect the worst possible outcome. While our reserving scenarios reflect a wide range of possible outcomes (on a probability weighted basis), reflecting the significant uncertainty regarding future developments and outcomes, our loss reserves may change materially based on future developments. As a result of inherent uncertainties in the estimates and judgments made to determine loss reserves, there can be no assurance that either the actual losses in our financial guarantee insurance portfolio will not exceed such reserves or that our reserves will not increase or decrease materially over time as circumstances, our assumptions, or our models change.\nAdditionally, inherent in our estimates of loss severities and remediation recoveries is the assumption that AAC or its subsidiaries, as applicable, will retain control rights in respect of our insured portfolio. However, according to the terms of relevant transaction documents, AAC or its subsidiaries, as applicable, may lose control rights in many insured transactions if, among other things, the relevant insurer is the subject of delinquency proceedings and/or other regulatory actions. If AAC or its subsidiaries lose control rights, their ability to mitigate loss severities and realize remediation recoveries will\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 11 2020 FORM 10-K |\nbe compromised, and actual ultimate losses in the insured portfolio could exceed current loss reserves.\nSome issuers of public finance obligations insured by AAC are experiencing fiscal stress that could result in increased losses on those obligations or increased liquidity claims, including losses or claims resulting from payment defaults, Chapter 9 bankruptcy or other restructuring proceedings or loss of market access.\nSome issuers of public finance obligations insured by AAC have reported, or may report, budget shortfalls, significantly underfunded pensions or other fiscal stresses that imperil their ability to pay debt service or will require them to significantly raise taxes and/or cut spending in order to satisfy their obligations. Furthermore, over time, the consequences of poor public policy decisions by state and local governments or increases in tax burdens can impact demographic trends, such as out-migration from one state or municipality to another, that may negatively impact the creditworthiness of related issuers. Some issuers of obligations insured by AAC have declared a payment moratorium, defaulted or filed for bankruptcy or similar debt adjustment proceedings, raising concerns about their ultimate ability or willingness to service the debt insured by AAC and AAC's ability to recover claims paid in the future. If the issuers of the obligations in the public finance portfolio are unable to raise taxes, cut spending, or receive federal or state assistance, or if such issuers default or file for bankruptcy under Chapter 9 or for similar relief under other laws that allow for the adjustment of debts, AAC may experience liquidity claims and/or ultimate losses on those obligations, which could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCatastrophic public health or environmental events, like the COVID-19 pandemic or those associated with hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires and droughts, that result in material disruption of economic activity, loss of human life or significant property damage, can have a materially negative impact on the financial performance of issuers of public finance, structured finance, investor owned utility, privatized military housing and other obligations insured by AAC. Such stresses could result in liquidity claims and/or permanent losses on obligations of those obligations.\nThe emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting containment measures have caused economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and are expected to continue to materially adversely affect, our business and results of operations. Ambac insures the obligations of a number of issuers that have been, or may in the future be, substantially affected by the economic effects of COVID-19, such as municipalities and securitizations, including those backed by consumer loans such as mortgages or student loans. As described more fully in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, municipalities and their authorities, agencies and instrumentalities, especially those dependent on narrow revenue streams flowing from particular economic activities, have suffered, and are expected to continue to suffer, from severely depressed revenues due to shelter-in-place orders, social distancing guidelines, travel bans and restrictions, and business shutdowns as well as an economic recession brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, securitizations dependent on cash flows from\npayments on mortgage loans, student loans or other assets have experienced, and are expected to continue to experience, shortfalls in receipts due to borrower nonpayments. See Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Executive Summary, Financial Guarantees in Force, Liquidity and Capital Resources and Balance Sheet for further detail.\nThe U.S. Federal government and other governments globally have taken certain measures to aid consumers, businesses, state and local governments, and the financial markets, but the impact of such aid remains unclear. U.S. Federal and State governments and their agencies have also adopted policies or guidelines to provide emergency relief to consumers, such as limiting debt collection efforts, encouraging or requiring extensions, modifications or forbearance with respect to certain loans and fees, and establishing foreclosure and eviction moratoriums. Several of these policies or guidelines have been extended beyond their initial terms and could be expanded over time as the economic effects of the pandemic become more well known. To the extent such measures cause greater incidences of missed mortgage loan, student loan or other debt service payments than would have occurred without governmental intervention, Ambac may experience higher losses in its insured portfolio of asset-backed securities.\nAAC also insures the obligations of a number of issuers that have been, or may in the future be, substantially affected by environmental or other public health events, including flooding, hurricanes, earthquakes, wildfires and drought. In addition, certain catastrophic environmental events, notably wildfires, can result in significant potential liabilities for issuers such as investor-owned utilities that increase bankruptcy risk and the potential default on obligations of the issuer insured by AAC.\nThe ultimate impact of a catastrophic public health event like COVID-19 or a catastrophic environmental event on issuers and their obligations, and the economy in general, is by its very nature uncertain, and will be determined by a number of factors including, but not limited to, the depth and duration of the crisis; the extent to which affected consumers, businesses, municipal entities and other debtors or sources of revenues recover from depressed economic circumstances, and the timelines for such recoveries; the level and efficacy of government intervention or support for municipal entities, consumers, businesses and the financial markets via emergency relief measures; the availability of insurance; the availability of cost-effective financing; management of public health crisis remediation efforts, including the availability, utilization and efficacy of vaccinations; the effectiveness of other public or private crisis management efforts, mitigation measures or support; and certain socio-economic variables, such as unemployment levels. Consequently, if issuers affected by such catastrophic events do not have sufficient resources or financial flexibility, receive adequate measures of support or realize the appropriate level of economic recovery, their ultimate ability to service the debt insured by Ambac could be materially impaired and Ambac could suffer material permanent losses.\nAt this time, there are significant uncertainties surrounding the ultimate number of claims and the extent of losses Ambac will face as a result of the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual losses may vary materially from Ambac's loss\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 12 2020 FORM 10-K |\nand loss expense reserves due to the factors described above and the inherent uncertainties in estimating losses given the evolving nature of the pandemic and its impact on issuers of Ambac insured debt and the economy in general. Potential ultimate losses from the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic could be material and therefore may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAAC insures obligations of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, including certain of its authorities and public corporations that are either subject to a Title III bankruptcy protection proceeding under the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management and Stability Act (\"PROMESA\") or have otherwise suspended debt service payments. AAC has made and may continue to be required to make significant amounts of policy payments over the next several years, the recoverability of which is subject to great uncertainty, which may lead to material permanent losses. While we believe our reserves are adequate to cover losses on Puerto Rico insured bonds, there can be no assurance that AAC may not incur additional losses in the future, particularly given the uncertainty related to the ongoing Title III proceedings and the developing economic, political and legal circumstances in Puerto Rico. Such losses may have a material adverse effect on AAC's results of operation and financial condition.\nAAC has exposure to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the \"Commonwealth\"), including its authorities and public corporations. Each has its own credit risk profile attributable to, as applicable, discrete revenue sources, direct general obligation pledges and/or general obligation guarantees. AAC had approximately $1,070 million of net par exposure to the Commonwealth and these instrumentalities at December 31, 2020. Components of the overall Puerto Rico net par outstanding include capital appreciation bonds that are reported at the par amount at the time of issuance of the related insurance policy as opposed to the current accreted value of the bonds. The outstanding net insured amount including accretion on capital appreciation bonds is approximately $1,284 million at December 31, 2020. Total net insured lifetime debt service (net par and interest) to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities was approximately $2,540 million at December 31, 2020.\nAs a result of the developments described in these Risk Factors and elsewhere in this 10-K (see Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Guarantees in Force, and Note 7. Financial Guarantee Insurance Contracts to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K), the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and certain of its instrumentalities are continuing to default on debt service payments, including payments owed on bonds insured by AAC. AAC has made, and may continue to be required to make, significant amounts of policy payments over the next several years, the recoverability of which is subject to great uncertainty, which may lead to material permanent losses. Our exposure to Puerto Rico is impacted by the amount of monies available for debt service, which is in turn affected by a number of factors including variability in economic growth and demographic trends, tax revenues, changes in law or the effects thereof, essential services expense, federal funding of Commonwealth\nneeds as well as interpretation of legislation, legal documents, and updated financial information (when available).\nSubstantial uncertainty also exists with respect to the ultimate outcome for creditors in Puerto Rico due to the Commonwealth Plan of Adjustment or changes thereto, as well as legislation enacted by the Commonwealth and the United States, including PROMESA, as well as actions taken in reliance on such laws, including Title III filings. AAC is involved in multiple litigations relating to such actions and other issues and may not be successful in pursuing claims or protecting its interests.\nGiven the numerous uncertainties and risks existing with respect to the restructuring process, outcomes associated with the Commonwealth Plan of Adjustment or any changes thereto and relevant litigation, no assurance can be given that ultimate debt service discounts will not be very severe and cause Ambac to experience losses materially exceeding current reserves. It is possible that certain restructuring process solutions, together with associated legislation, budgetary, and/or public policy proposals could be adopted and could significantly further impair our exposures. In addition, there are possible final legal determinations, including failing to recognize or properly differentiate legal structures and protections applicable to such exposures, that could result in losses exceeding our current reserves by a material amount and further increases to our loss reserves. In particular, in a Title III process, should court-approved plans of adjustment for the Commonwealth, Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority (\"PRHTA\"), the Puerto Rico Public Buildings Authority (\"PBA\") or any other issuers of Ambac-insured debt that may or may not file for Title III protection contemplate discounts to debt service implied by, or even worse than, the Commonwealth Fiscal Plan (May 27, 2020) or Ambac receive unfavorable judgments in the litigations to which it is a party, Ambac\u2019s financial condition would be materially adversely affected. For example, the amended disclosure statement and plan of adjustment (\"Amended POA\") to restructure $35 billion of debt and other claims against the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, PBA, and Employees Retirement Systems (\"ERS\"), as well as more than $50 billion in pension liabilities that was filed by the Federal Oversight Management Board for Puerto Rico (\"Oversight Board\") on February 28, 2020, provides for an average of 3.9% recoveries on claims for non-General Obligation and PBA bonds, including revenue bonds insured by Ambac. If the Amended POA was confirmed in its current form, Ambac's financial condition would be materially adversely affected. It is also possible that economic or demographic outcomes may be as, or worse than, forecasted in the Commonwealth Fiscal Plan or under proposals or plans promulgated by the Commonwealth or its instrumentalities in or in connection with a Title III process or otherwise. Even a negotiated restructuring to which Ambac agrees as part of mediation or other process may involve material losses in excess of current reserves. While our reserving scenarios reflect a wide range of possible outcomes reflecting the significant uncertainty regarding future developments and outcomes, given our exposure to Puerto Rico and the economic, fiscal, legal and political uncertainties associated therewith, our loss reserves may ultimately prove to be insufficient to cover our losses, potentially by a material amount, and may be subject to material volatility.\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 13 2020 FORM 10-K |\nCertain judicial decisions related to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico's PROMESA Title III proceedings may materially adversely affect our Public Finance insured portfolio.\nOn January 13, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a petition for Writ of Certiorari to review decisions in March and June 2019 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit that affirmed decisions by the U.S. District Court overseeing the PROMESA Title III proceedings for the PRHTA, decisions which found that under Sections 928(a) and 922(d) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, municipal issuers of revenue bonds secured by special revenues are permitted, but not required, to apply special revenues to pay debt service on such revenue bonds during the pendency of bankruptcy proceedings for such municipal issuers. The complainants, including AAC, had sought an order compelling PRHTA, as the debtor, to continue to make debt service payments on its revenue bonds from pledged special revenues during the pendency of its Title III case, but the First Circuit affirmed the District Court\u2019s dismissals of the complaints, holding that it could not compel the issuer to make such payments. The First Circuit's decisions challenge what had been a commonly understood notion in the municipal finance marketplace that municipal revenue bondholders secured by special revenues (as defined in Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code) would continue to receive payment during a bankruptcy of the municipal issuer. Although the First Circuit\u2019s decisions are binding only on federal district and bankruptcy courts in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Puerto Rico and Rhode Island, they introduce significant uncertainty into the public finance market, may make it more difficult for municipal instrumentalities to procure revenue bond financings in the future and increase the credit risk to bondholders of existing special revenue bonds, particularly those from weaker issuers.\nIt is unclear how these rulings may ultimately impact Ambac's revenue bond municipal exposures, inclusive of Puerto Rico. However, potential impacts could include ratings downgrades, decreased or more costly access to capital markets for certain issuers to refinance their insured debt or raise new debt, and lower recoveries in a restructuring or bankruptcy. At December 31, 2020, AAC insured approximately $3,644 million of net par of special revenue issuers, including $1,235 million net par of watch list exposure and $1,333 million net par of adversely classified exposure, $490 million of which was Puerto Rico exposure.\nWe are subject to credit risk and other risks in our insured portfolio, including related to RMBS and securities backed by student loans. We are also subject to risks associated with adverse selection as our insured portfolio runs off. Measures taken to reduce such risks may have an adverse effect on the Company's operating results or financial position.\nPerformance of our insured transactions, including (but not limited to) RMBS transactions and those involving securities backed by student loans, can be adversely affected by general economic conditions, such as recession, rising unemployment rates, underemployment, home prices that decline or do not increase in the patterns assumed in our models, increasing foreclosure rates and unavailability of consumer credit, mortgage product attributes, such as interest rate adjustments and balloon payment obligations, borrower and/or originator fraud, mortgage and student loan servicer performance or\nunderperformance and financial difficulty, such as risks related to whether the servicer may be required to delay the remittance of any cash collections held by it or received by it after the time it becomes subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings.\nWhile further deterioration in the performance of consumer assets, including mortgage-related assets and student loans, may occur, the timing, extent and duration of any future deterioration of the credit markets is unknown, as is the impact on potential claim payments and ultimate losses on the securities within our portfolio. In addition, there can be no assurance that any governmental or private sector initiatives designed to address such credit deterioration in the markets will be successful or inure to the benefit of the transactions we insure. For example, any initiative which permits the discharge of student loan debt in bankruptcy may adversely affect our portfolio. Similarly, servicer settlements with governmental authorities regarding foreclosure or servicing irregularities are generally designed to protect borrowers and may increase losses on securities we insure. In particular, the student loan industry and, specifically, trusts with securities insured by AAC have been subject to heightened Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) scrutiny and enforcement action over servicing and collections practices and potential chain of title issues and, consequently, any settlements, orders, consents or penalties resulting from CFPB actions, or any failure on the part of servicers or other parties asserting claims against delinquent borrowers to establish title to the loans, could lead to increased losses on securities we insure. Risks such as these are potentially heightened by Democratic control of the United States Congress and executive branch.\nIn addition, there can be no assurance that AAC would be successful, or that it would not be delayed, in enforcing the subordination provisions, credit enhancements or other contractual provisions of the RMBS that AAC insures.\nAs the runoff of the insured portfolio continues, the proportion of exposures we rate as below investment grade relative to the aggregate insured portfolio is likely to continue to increase, leaving the portfolio increasingly concentrated in higher risk exposures. This risk may result in greater volatility or have adverse effects on the Company's results from operations and on our financial condition.\nOne of our primary goals is to create shareholder value through transaction terminations, policy commutations, reinsurance, settlements and restructurings that we believe will improve our risk profile. As we take such actions to reduce known and potential risks, such actions may negatively impact our operating results or financial position in one or more reporting periods.\nOur credit risk management policies and practices may not adequately identify significant risks.\nAs described in Part I, Item 1, \u201cRisk Management\u201d in this Form 10-K, we have established risk management policies and practices which seek to mitigate our exposure to credit risk in our insured portfolio. Ongoing surveillance of credit risks in our insured portfolio is an important component of our risk management process. These policies and practices in the past have not insulated us from risks that were unforeseen and which had unanticipated loss severity, and such policies and practices\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 14 2020 FORM 10-K |\nmay not do so in the future. There can be no assurance that these policies and practices will be adequate to avoid future losses. If we are not able to identify significant risks, we may not be able to timely remediate such risks, thereby increasing the amount of losses to which we are exposed. An inability to identify significant risks could also result in the failure to establish loss reserves that are sufficient in relation to such risks.\nWe use analytical models and tools to assist our projection of performance of our insured obligations and our investment portfolio but actual results could differ materially from the model and tool outputs and related analyses.\nWe rely on internally and externally developed complex financial models, including default models related to RMBS and a waterfall tool provided by a nationally recognized vendor for RMBS and student loan exposures, to project performance of our insured obligations and similar securities in our investment portfolio. These models and tools assume various conditions, probability scenarios, facts and circumstances, and there can be no assurance that such models or tools accurately predict or measure the quantum of losses, loss reserves and timing of losses. Differences in the models and tools that we employ, uncertainties or flaws in these financial models and tools, or faulty assumptions inherent in these financial models and tools or those determined by management could lead to material changes in projected outcomes, and could include increased losses, loss reserves and/or other than temporary investment impairments. Moreover, estimates of transaction performance depend in part on the interpretation of contracts and other bases of our legal rights. Such interpretations may prove to be incorrect or different interpretations may be employed by bond trustees and other transaction participants and, ultimately courts, which could lead to increased losses, loss reserves and/or investment impairments.\nPolitical developments may materially adversely affect our insured portfolio.\nOur insured exposures and our results of operations can be materially affected by political developments at the federal, state and/or local government levels. Government shutdowns, trade disputes, political turnover, judicial decisions, adverse changes in federal funding, or poor public policy decision making could disrupt the national and local economies where we have insured exposures. In addition, we are exposed to correlation risk as a result of the possibility that multiple credits may concurrently and/or consecutively experience losses or increased stress as a result of any such event or series of events.\nRisks Related to Indebtedness\nAAC's ability to generate the significant amount of cash needed to service its debt and financial obligations and its ability to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness or obtain additional financing depends on many factors beyond our control.\nAAC is highly leveraged. AAC\u2019s ability to make payments on and/or refinance its debt and to fund its operations will depend on its ability to generate substantial operating cash flow and on the performance of the insured portfolio. AAC\u2019s cash flow generation will depend on receipt of premiums, investment returns, earnings from subsidiaries and potential litigation recoveries offset by policyholder claims, commutation\npayments, reinsurance premiums, operating and loss adjustment expenses, and interest expense, which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control and many of which are event-driven. There is substantial risk that AAC may not have the financial resources necessary to pay its debts in full and on time due to risks associated with its cash flow, expected litigation recoveries and insured portfolio, as discussed elsewhere in these Risk Factors.\nAs of December 31, 2020, AAC had approximately $1,947 million of indebtedness outstanding (the Tier 2 Notes and the Ambac Note) that are senior to its surplus notes. AAC had $573 million principal balance of surplus notes outstanding plus $365 million principal balance of junior surplus notes outstanding as of December 31, 2020. The Tier 2 Notes and the Ambac Note are secured by potential litigation recoveries (and in the case of the Ambac Note, other assets), the receipt of which is highly uncertain, as more fully discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. Failure to achieve litigation recoveries in an amount sufficient to repay the Tier 2 Notes and the Ambac Note would materially weaken AAC\u2019s ability to service its indebtedness.\nIf AAC cannot pay its policyholders\u2019 claims or service its debt, it will have to take actions such as selling assets, restructuring or refinancing its debt or seeking additional capital. Any of these remedies may not, if necessary, be effected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Because of these and other factors beyond our control, AAC may be unable to pay the principal, interest or other amounts on its indebtedness when due or ever.\nWe have substantial indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial condition, operational flexibility and our ability to obtain financing in the future.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have significant consequences for our financial condition and operational flexibility. For example, it could:\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic, competitive and industry conditions;\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, payment of policyholder claims, debt service requirements, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes on satisfactory terms or at all;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for operations and to fund the execution of our key strategies;\n\u2022limit or restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022limit our ability or increase the costs to refinance indebtedness or repay such indebtedness due to ongoing interest accretion;\n\u2022limit our ability to attract and retain key employees; and\n\u2022limit our ability to enter into hedging transactions by reducing the number of counterparties with whom we can enter into such transactions, as well as the volume of those transactions.\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 15 2020 FORM 10-K |\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we may incur additional debt. While restrictive covenants in certain of our contracts may limit the amount of additional indebtedness AAC may incur, we may obtain waivers of those restrictions and incur additional indebtedness in the future. In addition, if Ambac incurred indebtedness, its ability to make scheduled payments on, or refinance, any such indebtedness may depend on the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions or pay dividends, which in turn will depend on their future operating performance and contractual, legal and regulatory restrictions on the payment of distributions or dividends to which they may be subject. There can be no assurance that any such dividends or distributions would be made. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage.\nThere may not be sufficient collateral to pay any or all of the Secured Notes or Tier 2 Notes.\nIn addition to AAC\u2019s right to representation and warranty (\"R&W\") recoveries in respect of the RMBS litigations, which is inherently uncertain, the Ambac Note is also secured by cash and securities having an estimated fair market value of approximately $178 million. However, there can be no assurance that the fair market value of these securities will not decrease significantly. The value of the securities collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. Consequently, when combined with potential R&W recoveries, liquidating the securities collateral securing the Ambac Note may not produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay all amounts due on the Secured Notes.\nThe ability of the holders of the Secured Notes or Tier 2 Notes to realize upon any of the collateral securing the Ambac Note and the Secured Notes or Tier 2 Notes, as the case may be, may also be subject to bankruptcy and insolvency law limitations or similar limitations applicable in insurance company rehabilitation or liquidation proceedings. In the event of rehabilitation, liquidation, conservation, dissolution or other insolvency proceeding, AAC cannot assure holders that the proceeds from any sale or liquidation of the securities collateral will be sufficient to pay any or all of AAC\u2019s obligations under the Ambac Note. Moreover, the rehabilitator, liquidator or court overseeing such a proceeding may not assign value to the collateral with respect to the Ambac Note or the Tier 2 Notes, including AAC\u2019s rights to recoveries in respect of the RMBS litigations, in an amount sufficient to discharge all or a substantial portion of AAC's obligations under or with respect to the Ambac Note, the Secured Notes and/or the Tier 2 Notes.\nAAC has not made regular interest or principal payments on surplus notes and can not provide any assurance as to when payments will be made, if ever.\nPayments of interest and principal on surplus notes are subject to the prior approval of the OCI. Since the issuance of the surplus notes in 2010, OCI has declined to approve regular payments of interest on surplus notes, although the OCI has permitted exceptional payments in connection with (a) increasing the percentage of deferred policy payments of the Segregated Account of AAC from 25% to 45% in 2014 and (b) a one-time payment of approximately six months of interest on the surplus notes outstanding immediately after the consummation of the Rehabilitation Exit Transactions in 2018. AAC also did not\nreceive approval from OCI to make payment of the surplus notes on their scheduled maturity date of June 7, 2020, and therefore the scheduled maturity date was extended until OCI grants approval to make payment, in part or in full. Interest will accrue, compounded on each anniversary of the original scheduled maturity date, on any unpaid principal and interest through the actual date of payment, at 5.1% per annum. Holders of surplus notes have no rights to enforce the payment of the principal of, or interest on, surplus notes in the absence of OCI approval to pay such amount. If OCI does not approve regular payments on the surplus notes within the next several years, the total amount due for surplus notes may exceed AAC's financial resources and holders of surplus notes may not ever be paid in full.\nSurplus notes are subordinated in right of payment to other claims, which could impair the right of the holders of such notes to receive interest and principal in the event of our insolvency or a similar occurrence.\nSurplus notes are unsecured obligations of AAC and are expressly subordinated in right of payment to all of AAC\u2019s existing and future indebtedness and policy claims. The surplus notes are subject to provisions of Wisconsin insurance law, which establishes the priority of distribution of claims from the estate of an insolvent insurance company. In the event that AAC becomes subject to rehabilitation, liquidation, conservation or dissolution, holders of AAC\u2019s senior indebtedness and policy claims would be afforded a higher priority of distribution than holders of the surplus notes, and accordingly would have the right to be paid in full before holders of the surplus notes would be paid. Due to the nature of AAC\u2019s business, the amount of such higher priority claims in any rehabilitation, liquidation, conservation or dissolution is likely to be many times greater than any free and divisible surplus and it is likely that the holders of surplus notes would not recover any payment in such circumstances. In addition, claims of holders of the surplus notes will be subordinated to certain liabilities of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries that are guaranteed by AAC.\nThe amount of interest payable on the Secured Notes is set only once per interest period based on the three-month LIBOR rate on the applicable interest determination date, which rate may fluctuate substantially; increases in interest rates will increase the cost of servicing our debt reducing our profitability and may affect our ability to make payment on the Secured Notes.\nThe Secured Notes will bear interest at floating rates that could rise significantly, increasing AAC\u2019s interest expense and reducing its cash flow and profitability. Each one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in a $6 million increase in the annual cash interest payments due on the Secured Notes. If AAC\u2019s interest expense increases significantly, whether due to changes in LIBOR or increased borrowing costs when it refinances its current indebtedness, AAC may not be able to make payments with respect to the Secured Notes or its other indebtedness.\nAmbac\u2019s estimated R&W recovery may be reduced, causing the perceived value of the collateral securing the Secured Notes and Tier 2 Notes to change, and any such change may be material.\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 16 2020 FORM 10-K |\nAmbac reevaluates its estimated R&W recoveries on a quarterly basis in connection with the preparation of its financial statements. See \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d in Part II, Item 7, Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 8. Financial Guarantee Insurance Contracts to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. As a result of any reevaluation, the estimated amount of Ambac\u2019s R&W recovery may be adjusted downward due to, among other things, changes in management's view of such estimated recoveries and/or changes in the loss reserves related to such recoveries, and any adjustment may be material. A reduction in estimated R&W recoveries may result in material changes in Ambac\u2019s financial condition, including its capital and liquidity. In addition, any reduction to estimated R&W recoveries may alter the perceived value of the collateral securing the Secured Notes and Tier 2 Notes before payment on the Secured Notes or Tier 2 Notes is made in full, which may affect the value of, and trading market, if any, for, the Secured Notes or Tier 2 Notes. Management makes no representation that the estimated R&W recoveries will not be reduced, materially, including in the near term. There can be no assurance that the estimated R&W recoveries securing the Secured Notes and Tier 2 Notes will equal or exceed the principal amount of the Secured Notes and Tier 2 Notes, respectively, at all times prior to maturity.\nRisks Related to Capital, Liquidity and Markets\nOur inability to realize the expected recoveries included in our financial statements could adversely impact our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and the value of our securities, including the Secured Notes and Tier 2 Notes.\nAAC is pursuing claims in litigation with respect to certain RMBS transactions that it insured. These claims are based on, among other things, representations with respect to the characteristics of the securitized loans, the absence of borrower fraud in the underlying loan pools or other misconduct in the origination process, the compliance of loans with the prevailing underwriting policies, and compliance of the RMBS transaction counterparties with policies and procedures related to loan origination and securitization. In such cases, where contract claims are being pursued, the sponsor of the transaction is contractually obligated to repurchase, cure or substitute collateral for any loan that breaches the representations and warranties. However, generally the sponsors have not honored those obligations and have vigorously defended claims brought against them.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have estimated RMBS R&W subrogation recoveries of $1,725 million (net of reinsurance) included in our financial statements. These estimated recoveries are based on the contractual claims brought in the aforementioned litigations and represent a probability-weighted estimate of amounts we expect to recover under various possible scenarios. The estimated recoveries we have recorded do not represent the best or the worst possible outcomes with respect to any particular transaction or group of transactions.\nThere can be no assurance that AAC will be successful in prosecuting its claims in the RMBS litigations. The outcome of any litigation, including the RMBS litigations, is inherently unpredictable, including because of risks intrinsic in the\nadversarial nature of litigation. Motions made to the court, rulings and appeals - in the cases being prosecuted by AAC or in other relevant cases - could delay or otherwise impact any recovery by AAC. Moreover, rulings that may be adverse to AAC (in any of its RMBS litigations, as well as in other RMBS cases in which it is not a party) could adversely affect AAC\u2019s ability to pursue its claims or the amount or timing of any recovery, or negatively alter settlement dynamics with RMBS litigation defendants. Any litigation award or settlement may be for an amount less than the amount necessary (even when combined with other pledged collateral) to pay the Secured Notes or the Tier 2 Notes, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and make it more difficult for AAC to repay the Ambac Note (and therefore make it more difficult for the issuer of the Secured Notes to repay the Secured Notes) and/or the Tier 2 Notes and/or AAC\u2019s outstanding surplus notes, on a timely basis or at all. In the event that AAC is unable to satisfy its obligations with respect to the Secured Notes or Tier 2 Notes, holders will have the right to foreclose on any available collateral and to sue AAC for failure to make required payments; however, there can be no assurance that the sale of collateral will produce proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay any or all amounts due on the Secured Notes or Tier 2 Notes, as the case may be, or that holders will be successful in any litigation seeking payments. Additionally, while AAC may pursue settlement negotiations, there can be no assurance that any settlement negotiations will materialize or that any settlement agreement can be reached on terms acceptable to AAC, or at all. Depending on the length of time required to resolve these litigations, either through settlement or at trial, AAC could incur greater litigation expenses than currently projected. If a case is brought to trial, AAC\u2019s ultimate recovery would be subject to the additional risks inherent in any trial, including adverse findings or determinations by the trier of fact or the court, which could adversely impact the value of our securities, including the Secured Notes and Tier 2 Notes.\nAny litigation award is subject to risks of recovery, including that the sponsor is unable pay a judgment that AAC may obtain in litigation. In some instances, AAC also has claims against a parent or an acquirer of the counterparty. However, AAC may not be successful in enforcing its claims against any successor entity.\nThe RMBS litigations could also be adversely affected if AAC does not have sufficient resources to actively prosecute its claims or becomes subject to rehabilitation, liquidation, conservation or dissolution, or otherwise impaired by actions of OCI.\nOur ability to realize the estimated RMBS R&W subrogation recoveries included in our financial statements and the time of the recoveries, if any, is subject to significant uncertainty, including the risks described above and uncertainties inherent in the assumptions used in estimating such recoveries. The amount of these subrogation recoveries is significant and if we were unable to recover all such amounts, our stockholders\u2019 equity as of December 31, 2020 would decrease from $1,140 million to $(585) million.\nWe expect to recover material amounts of claims payments through remediation measures including the litigation described above as well as through cash flows in the securitization\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 17 2020 FORM 10-K |\nstructures of transactions that AAC insures. Realization of such expected recoveries is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the rights and defenses of other parties with interests that conflict with AAC's interests, the performance of the collateral and assets backing the obligations that AAC insures, and the performance of servicers involved in securitizations in which AAC participates as insurer. Additionally, our ability to realize recoveries in insured transactions may be impaired if the continuing orders of the Rehabilitation Court are not effective.\nAdverse developments with respect to such variables may cause our recoveries to fall below expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, including our capital and liquidity, and may result in adverse consequences such as impairing the ability of AAC to honor its financial obligations; the initiation of rehabilitation proceedings against AAC; decreased likelihood of AAC delivering value to AFG, through dividends or otherwise; diminished business prospects due to third party concerns about our ability to recover losses; and a significant drop in the value of securities issued or insured by AFG or AAC, including the Secured Notes and Tier 2 Notes.\nAmbac\u2019s estimate of RMBS litigation recoveries is subject to significant uncertainty and changes to the estimate could adversely impact its liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor Ambac\u2019s RMBS cases for which it records an RMBS R&W subrogation recovery in its financial statements, Ambac has obtained loan files from the relevant original pool and has conducted loan file re-underwriting to derive a breach rate that is extrapolated to estimate the damages Ambac expects to recover. Ambac does not estimate an RMBS R&W subrogation recovery for litigations where its sole claim is for fraudulent inducement.\nThe amount estimated for purposes of Ambac\u2019s RMBS R&W subrogation recovery and the amount Ambac may ultimately receive is subject to significant uncertainty, as described in the immediately preceding risk factor. Ambac\u2019s findings and assumptions regarding collateral performance and Ambac\u2019s expectations with respect to the outcome of the RMBS litigations have a significant impact on Ambac\u2019s estimated RMBS R&W subrogation recovery. If these findings, assumptions or estimates prove to be incorrect or otherwise do not support our claims, actual recoveries could differ materially from those estimated. Actual recoveries will ultimately depend on future events and there can be no assurance that our view of collateral performance or our estimated RMBS R&W subrogation recoveries will not differ from actual events. Although Ambac believes that its methodology for estimating recoveries is appropriate, the methodologies Ambac uses to estimate expected collateral losses and specific transaction performance may not be similar to methodologies used by Ambac\u2019s competitors, counterparties or other market participants. The determination of expected RMBS R&W subrogation recoveries is an inherently subjective and complex process involving numerous estimates and assumptions and judgments by management, using both internal and external data sources to derive a specific transaction's cash flows. As a result, Ambac\u2019s current estimates may not reflect Ambac\u2019s ultimate recovery, and management makes no representation that the actual amounts recovered, if any, will not differ materially from those estimated. The failure of Ambac\u2019s actual recoveries to\nmeet or exceed its current estimates could result in a material adverse effect on Ambac\u2019s financial condition, including its capital and liquidity.\nWe may not be able to commute or reduce FG insured exposures.\nIn pursuing the objective of improving our financial position, we are seeking to commute or reduce FG insured exposures. De-risking transactions may not be feasible or economically viable. We cannot provide any assurance that any such transaction will be consummated in the future, or if it is, as to the timing, terms or conditions of any such transaction. Even if we consummate one or more of such transactions, doing so may ultimately prove to be unsuccessful in creating value for any or all of our stakeholders and may adversely affect our operating results or financial position.\nRevenues and cash flow would be adversely impacted by a decline in realization of installment premiums.\nA significant percentage of our premium revenue is attributable to installment premiums. The amount of installment premiums we actually realize could be reduced in the future due to factors such as early termination of insurance contracts, accelerated prepayments of underlying obligations or insufficiency of cash flows (by the premium paying entity). Such reductions would result in lower revenues.\nThe composition of the securities in our investment portfolio exposes us to greater risk than before we invested in \"alternative assets.\"\nEach of AAC and Ambac UK maintains a portion of its investment portfolio in below investment grade securities, equities and/or \u201calternative assets\u201d with the objective to increase risk-adjusted portfolio returns. Investments in below investment grade securities, equities and \u201calternative assets\u201d could expose AAC and/or Ambac UK to greater earnings volatility, increased losses and decreased liquidity in the investment portfolio.\nWe may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain third-party financing or raise additional third-party capital on acceptable terms, or at all.\nAn inability to obtain third-party debt financing or raise additional third-party capital, when required by us or when business conditions warrant, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The economic conditions affecting our industry, as well as other factors, may constrain our financing abilities. Our ability to secure third-party financing, if available, and to satisfy or refinance our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon regulatory conditions, our future operating performance, the availability of credit generally, economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. The market conditions and the macroeconomic conditions that affect our industry could have a material adverse effect on our ability to secure third-party financing on favorable terms, if at all.\nIf third-party financing is not available when needed, or is available on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities, respond to competitive pressures or refinance our outstanding indebtedness, any of\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 18 2020 FORM 10-K |\nwhich could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAAC may in the future report a policyholders\u2019 deficit or become insolvent.\nWhile the Rehabilitation Exit Transactions and related transactions were designed to improve our financial condition, we will continue to be subject to risks and uncertainties that could materially affect our financial position, including those relating to our exposures in Puerto Rico, our efforts to recover losses on insured RMBS through litigation, and other risks described in the Risk Factors set forth in this Item 1A. Therefore, even following consummation of the Rehabilitation Exit Transactions, circumstances may occur that would cause AAC to report a policyholders\u2019 deficit, not comply with the statutory minimum policyholders\u2019 surplus, undergo rehabilitation and/or become insolvent.\nThe determination of the amount of credit impairments taken on our investments is highly subjective and could materially impact our results of operations or financial position.\nThe determination of the amount of credit impairments on our investments varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in impairments as such evaluations are revised. There can be no assurance that management has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken in our financial statements. Furthermore, additional impairments may need to be taken in the future and historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments. We use financial models and tools to project impairments. Differences and flaws in these models and tools, and/or faulty assumptions inherent in these models and tools and those determined by management, could lead to increased impairments.\nRisks Related to the Financial and Credit Markets\nChanges in prevailing interest rate levels and market conditions could adversely impact our business results and prospects.\nIncreases in prevailing interest rate levels can adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio and, therefore, our financial strength. In the event that investments must be sold in order to pay claims, to pay debt obligations, to meet collateral posting requirements or to meet other liquidity needs, such investments would likely be sold at discounted prices. Additionally, increasing interest rates would have an adverse impact on our insured portfolio. For example, increasing interest rates could result in higher claim payments in respect of defaulted obligations that bear floating rates of interest. Higher interest rates can also lead to increased credit stress on consumer asset-backed transactions (as the securitized assets supporting a portion of these exposures are floating rate consumer obligations), slower prepayment speeds and resulting \u201cextension risk\u201d relative to such consumer asset-backed transactions in our insured and investment portfolios, and decreased refinancing activity.\nDecreasing interest rates could result in early terminations of financial guarantee insurance policies in respect of which we are paid on an installment basis and do not receive a termination premium, thus reducing premium earned for these transactions. Decreases in prevailing interest rates may also limit growth of, or reduce, investment income and may adversely impact our interest rate swap portfolio.\nOur investment portfolio may also be adversely affected by credit rating downgrades, ABS and RMBS prepayment speeds, foreign exchange movements, spread volatility, and credit losses.\nWe are subject to credit risk throughout our businesses, including large single risks, risk concentrations, correlated risks and reinsurance counterparty credit risk.\nWe are exposed to the risk that issuers of debt which we have insured, issuers of debt which we hold in our investment portfolio, reinsurers and other contract counterparties (including derivative counterparties) may default in their financial obligations, whether as the result of insolvency, lack of liquidity, operational failure, fraud or other reasons. These credit risks could cause increased losses and loss reserves, and/or estimates of credit impairments and mark-to-market losses with respect to credit derivatives in our financial guarantee business; and we could experience losses and decreases in the value of our investment portfolio and, therefore, our financial strength. Such credit risks may be in the form of large single risk exposures to particular issuers, reinsurers or counterparties; losses caused by catastrophic events (including public health crises, terrorist acts and natural disasters); losses caused by increases in municipal defaults; losses in respect of different, but correlated, credit exposures; or other forms of credit risk.\nUncertainties regarding the expected discontinuance of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate or any other interest rate benchmark could have adverse consequences.\nIn 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. On November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration and the FCA announced that most tenors of USD LIBOR are now expected to be published only through June 2023. However, Non-USD LIBOR, certain less common tenors of USD-LIBOR and certain other indices which are utilized as benchmarks are not expected to be published after 2021. AAC and Ambac UK insure securities, own assets, are party to certain derivative contracts and have issued debt and other obligations that reference LIBOR. While regulators and market participants have suggested substitute benchmark rates for LIBOR, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, the impact of the discontinuance and replacement of LIBOR is uncertain. It is not currently possible to know with certainty whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views and alternatives may have on the financial markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments for the periods preceding and following LIBOR's cessation. Differences in contractual provisions of certain legacy assets and liabilities and other factors, may cause the consequences of the discontinuance of LIBOR to vary by instrument. Legislation has been introduced in both the UK and the United States, including\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 19 2020 FORM 10-K |\nat the New York State level, to address issues with respect to legacy LIBOR-linked assets and liabilities, however it is unclear whether these initiatives will be passed and if so, whether they will fully address the issues associated with legacy transactions. As a result, the value of our assets, derivatives and liabilities; costs to operate our business; and the losses associated with our insured portfolio may be affected in a way that may ultimately materially adversely impact Ambac\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, Ambac may experience adverse tax and accounting impacts, system and model disruption, and increased liquidity demands in connection with the transition away from LIBOR that may have adverse operational consequences resulting in further adverse impacts on Ambac\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. Ambac continues to actively monitor developments surrounding the transition from LIBOR-based indices and evaluate the potential impact. In addition to reviewing several hundred transactions involving various LIBOR-based indices, Ambac has made, or is in the process of making, adjustments to its reporting and analytical infrastructures to facilitate the transition from LIBOR.\nRisks Related to the Company's Business\nWe are subject to the risk of litigation and regulatory inquiries or investigations, and the outcome of proceedings we are or may become involved in could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial position, profitability or cash flows.\nAAC is defending or otherwise involved in various lawsuits relating to its financial guarantee business. In addition, the Company from time to time receives various regulatory inquiries and requests for information. Please see Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for information on these various proceedings.\nIt is not possible to predict whether additional suits involving AFG, AAC or one or more other subsidiaries will be filed or whether additional regulatory inquiries or requests for information will be made, and it is also not possible to predict the outcome of litigation, inquiries or requests for information. It is possible that there could be unfavorable outcomes in these or other proceedings. Management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from unfavorable outcomes or of the expenses that will be incurred in defending these lawsuits. Under some circumstances, adverse results in any such proceedings and/or the incurring of significant litigation expenses could be material to our business, operations, financial position, profitability or cash flows.\nThe Settlement Agreement, Stipulation and Order and Indenture for the Tier 2 Notes contain restrictive covenants that may impair our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nPursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Stipulation and Order and indenture for the Tier 2 Notes, AAC must seek prior approval by OCI of certain corporate actions. The Settlement Agreement, Stipulation and Order and indenture for the Tier 2 Notes also include covenants which restrict the operations of AAC which, (i) in the case of the Settlement Agreement, remain in force until the surplus notes that were issued pursuant to the Settlement Agreement have been redeemed, repurchased or repaid in full, (ii) in the case of the Stipulation and Order, remain in place until the OCI decides to\nrelax such restrictions, and (iii) in the case of the indenture for the Tier 2 Notes, remain in force until the Tier 2 Notes have been redeemed, repurchased or repaid in full. Certain of these restrictions may be waived with the approval of holders of the applicable debt securities and/or OCI. If we are unable to obtain the required consents under the Settlement Agreement, the Stipulation and Order and/or the indenture for the Tier 2 Notes, we may not be able to execute our planned business strategies.\nOCI has certain enforcement rights with respect to the Settlement Agreement and Stipulation and Order. Disputes may arise over the interpretation of such agreements, the exercise or purported exercise of rights thereunder, or the performance of or failure or purported failure to perform obligations thereunder. Any such dispute could have material adverse effects on the Company, whether through litigation, administrative proceedings, supervisory orders, failure to execute transactions sought by management, interference with corporate strategies, objectives or prerogatives, inefficient decision-making or execution, forced realignment of resources, increased costs, distractions to management, strained working relationships or otherwise. Such effects would also increase the risk that OCI would seek to initiate rehabilitation proceedings against AAC.\nImpairment of the intangible and goodwill assets, which resulted from the acquisition of Xchange, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn connection with Ambac\u2019s acquisition of 80% of the membership interests of Xchange, Ambac recorded the fair value of identifiable intangible assets (primarily related to distribution relationships) and goodwill. The intangible assets will be amortized over their useful lives (weighted average of 14 years). The Company will test intangible assets for impairment if certain events occur or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the intangible asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill reflects the excess purchase consideration over net assets acquired and will be tested for impairment annually or whenever events occur or circumstances change that may indicate impairment. Intangible asset and goodwill impairments are driven by a variety of factors, which could include, among other things, declining future cash flows of the acquired business as addressed in other risk factors related to the Managing General Underwriting Business. Any intangible asset or goodwill impairment could adversely affect the Company's operating results and financial condition.\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches and cyber-attacks could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on our information technology systems for many enterprise-critical functions and a prolonged failure or interruption of these systems for any reason could cause significant disruption to our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Our information technology and application systems may be vulnerable to threats from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions. Computer hackers may be able to penetrate our network\u2019s system security and misappropriate or compromise confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. In addition to our own confidential information, we sometimes receive and are required to protect confidential information obtained from third parties and personally\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 20 2020 FORM 10-K |\nidentifiable information of individuals. To the extent any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of our confidential information or that of others, or personally identifiable information of individuals, it could cause significant financial losses that are either not, or not fully, insured against, cause damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with third parties, lead to claims against us, result in regulatory action, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to mitigate the damage caused by any security breach, or to protect against future damage. Moreover, although we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, we may not be able to adequately execute these plans in a timely fashion in the event of a disruption to our information technology and application systems.\nWe may be adversely affected by failures in services or products provided by third parties.\nWe have outsourced and may continue to outsource certain activities of our operations and business, and rely upon third-party vendors for other essential services and information, such as the provision of data used in setting loss reserves and the provision of risk management information and services. A material failure by an external service or information provider or a material defect in the products, services or information provided thereby could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inability to attract and retain qualified executives and employees or the loss of any of these personnel could negatively impact our business.\nOur ability to execute on our business strategies depends on the retention and recruitment of qualified executives and other professionals. We rely substantially upon the services of our current executive team. In addition to these officers, we require key staff with risk mitigation, structured finance, insurance, credit, investment, accounting, finance, legal and technical skills. As a result of Ambac\u2019s financial situation, there is a higher risk that executive officers and other key staff will leave the Company and replacements may not be motivated to join the Company. The loss of the services of members of our senior management team or our inability to hire and retain other talented personnel could delay or prevent us from succeeding in executing our strategies, which could further negatively impact our business.\nOur business could be negatively affected by actions of stakeholders whose interests may not be aligned with the broader interests of our stockholders.\nAmbac could be negatively affected as a result of actions by stakeholders whose interests may not be aligned with the broader interests of our stockholders, and responding to any such actions could be costly and time-consuming, disrupt operations and divert the attention of management and employees. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute on our strategic plans.\nRisks Related to International Business\nActions of the PRA and FCA could reduce the value of Ambac UK realizable by AAC, which would adversely affect our securityholders.\nAmbac\u2019s international business is operated by Ambac UK, which is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority (\u201cPRA\u201d) for prudential purposes and the Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) for conduct purposes. The terms of Ambac UK\u2019s regulatory authority are now restricted and Ambac UK is in run-off. Among other things, Ambac UK may not write any new business, and, with respect to any entity within the Ambac group of affiliates, commute, vary or terminate any existing financial guaranty policy, transfer certain assets, or pay dividends, without the prior approval of the PRA and FCA. The PRA and FCA act generally in the interests of Ambac UK policyholders and will not take into account the interests of securityholders of Ambac when considering whether to provide any such approval. Accordingly, determinations made by the PRA and FCA, in their capacity as Ambac UK\u2019s regulators, could potentially result in adverse consequences for our securityholders and also reduce the value realizable by AAC for Ambac UK.\nRegulatory uncertainty in relation to Ambac UK\u2019s capital position could adversely affect the value of Ambac UK and affect our securityholders.\nUnder applicable regulatory capital rules (\u201cSolvency II\u201d) Ambac UK remains deficient in terms of capital. Ambac UK does not have a remedial plan other than to build its assets over time by on-going premium collections and earned investment income, as well as attempting to accelerate the run-off of its exposures. Further, there currently is no prospect of any capital support from the Ambac group of affiliates. The PRA is aware of Ambac UK\u2019s position and prospects. The PRA supervisory statement SS7/15 \u201cSupervision of firms in difficulty or run-off\u201d notes that \u201cthere are many circumstances in which a run-off strategy is in the best interests of policyholders\u201d and notes that the PRA will review such firms and that they \u201cmay be permitted to continue activities necessary to carry out existing contracts in a manner, and for so long as, the PRA considers necessary in order to afford an appropriate degree of protection to policyholders\u201d. Ambac UK clearly falls into this category and therefore Ambac UK\u2019s current run-off approach remains at all times subject to the PRA continuing to take no action in relation to its capital deficit and related Solvency II requirements. Alternative courses of action open to the PRA could adversely impact the anticipated run-off trajectory of Ambac UK and impact its value.\nRisks Related to Taxation\nSurplus notes received in the AMPS Exchange and by holders of Deferred Amounts pursuant to the Second Amended Plan of Rehabilitation along with other debt reissued by Ambac may not be fungible for U.S. federal income tax purposes with other surplus notes and debt currently outstanding.\nSurplus notes received in the AMPS Exchange and by holders of Deferred Amounts pursuant to the Second Amended Plan of Rehabilitation along with other debt reissued by Ambac (together \"Reissued Debt\") have different issue prices for U.S. federal income tax purposes than the originally issued\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 21 2020 FORM 10-K |\noutstanding surplus notes and other debt and, therefore, are expected to accrue original issue discount (\u201cOID\u201d) in an amount that differs from the amounts of OID accruing on the originally issued surplus notes and other debt currently outstanding, as the case may be. Therefore, Reissued Debt may not be fungible with the other outstanding surplus notes and debt, as applicable, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Because Reissued Debt has the same CUSIP numbers as other related surplus notes and debt currently outstanding, the Reissued Debt will not be readily distinguishable from the other outstanding surplus notes and debt, as applicable. This could create uncertainty in the market and could adversely affect the liquidity and/or trading values of surplus notes and other debt.\nCertain surplus notes or other obligations of AAC may be characterized as equity of AAC and as a result, AAC may no longer be a member of the U.S. federal income tax consolidated group of which AFG is the common parent.\nIt is possible that certain surplus notes or other obligations of AAC may be characterized as equity of AAC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If such surplus notes or other obligations are characterized as equity of AAC that is taken into account for tax affiliation purposes and it is determined that such \u201cequity\u201d represented more than twenty percent of the total value of the stock of AAC, AAC may no longer be characterized as an includable corporation that is affiliated with AFG. As a result, AAC would no longer be characterized as a member of the U.S. federal income tax consolidated group of which AFG is the common parent (the \u201cAmbac Consolidated Group\u201d) and AAC would be required to file a separate consolidated tax return as the common parent of a new U.S. federal income tax consolidated group including AAC as the new common parent and AAC\u2019s affiliated subsidiaries (the \u201cAAC Consolidated Tax Group\u201d).\nTo the extent AAC is no longer a member of the Ambac Consolidated Group, AAC\u2019s net operating loss carry-forwards (\"NOLs\") (and certain other available tax attributes of AAC and the other members of the AAC Consolidated Tax Group) may no longer be available for use by the AAC Consolidated Tax Group or any of the remaining members of the AAC Consolidated Tax Group to reduce the U.S. federal income tax liabilities of the AAC Consolidated Tax Group. AFG, AAC and their affiliates entered into a tax sharing agreement that would require AFG to make certain tax elections that could mitigate the loss of NOLs and other tax attributes resulting from a deconsolidation of AAC from the Ambac Consolidated Group. However, in the event of a deconsolidation, certain other benefits resulting from U.S. federal income tax consolidation may no longer be available to the Ambac Consolidated Group, including certain favorable rules relating to transactions occurring between members of the Ambac Consolidated Group and members of the AAC Consolidated Tax Group.\nIf surplus notes or other obligations are characterized as equity of AAC, the AAC NOLs (and certain other tax attributes or tax benefits of the Ambac Consolidated Group) may be subject to limitation under Section 382 of the Tax Code.\nIt is possible that certain surplus notes or other obligations may be characterized as equity of AAC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such characterization could result in an \u201cownership change\u201d of AAC for purposes of Section 382 of the Tax Code. If\nsuch an ownership change were to occur, the value and amount of the AAC NOLs would be substantially impaired, increasing the U.S. federal income tax liability of AAC and materially reducing the value of AAC\u2019s stock owned by AFG and the potential for future dividend payments from AAC to AFG.\nDeductions with respect to interest accruing on certain surplus notes may be eliminated or deferred until payment.\nTo the extent certain surplus notes are characterized as equity for U.S. federal income tax purposes, accrued interest will not be deductible by AAC. In addition, even if such surplus notes are characterized as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the deduction of interest accruing on such surplus notes may be deferred until paid or eliminated in part depending upon (i) the terms of any deferral and payment provisions provided in such surplus notes, (ii) whether such surplus notes have \u201csignificant original issue discount,\u201d and (iii) the yield to maturity of surplus notes. To the extent deductions with respect to interest are eliminated or deferred, the U.S. federal income tax of the members of the Ambac Consolidated Group or the members of the AAC Consolidated Tax Group as the case may be, could be increased reducing the amount of cash available to pay its obligations.\nRisks Related to Strategic Plan\nAmbac is planning to further develop and expand the Specialty Property and Casualty Program Insurance business and the Managing General Agency/Underwriting business, which may permit utilization of Ambac\u2019s net operating loss carry-forwards; however, such plans may not be realized, or if realized, may not create value and may negatively impact our financial results.\nAmbac is planning to further develop and expand the Specialty Property and Casualty Program Insurance Business and the Managing General Agency/Underwriting business which may, amongst other things, permit utilization of its net operating loss carry-forwards. Such plans may involve additional acquisitions of assets or existing businesses and the development of businesses through new or existing subsidiaries. It is not possible at this time to fully predict the future prospects or other characteristics of such businesses. Although we intend to conduct business, financial and legal due diligence in connection with the evaluation of any future business or acquisition opportunities, there can be no assurance our due diligence investigations will identify every matter that could have a material adverse effect on us. Efforts to pursue certain business opportunities may be unsuccessful or require significant financial or other resources, which could have a negative impact on our operating results and financial condition. No assurance can be given that Ambac will be able to successfully execute its plans for new business, generate any earnings from new businesses or be able to successfully integrate any such business into our current operating structure.\nMoreover, Ambac\u2019s ability to enter into new businesses apart from AAC is subject to some doubt, given the financial condition of AAC, counterparty or rating agency concerns about our ability to mitigate insured portfolio losses or recover losses in litigation, the difficulty of leveraging or monetizing Ambac\u2019s other assets, and the uncertainty of its ability to raise capital. Due to these factors, as well as those relating to AAC as\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 22 2020 FORM 10-K |\ndescribed in this Item 1A. Risk Factors, the value of our securities is speculative.\nAmbac\u2019s current strategy and initiatives have been derived from, and created as a consequence of, the Company\u2019s current financial condition and circumstances. Should changes in Ambac\u2019s circumstances or financial condition or in the political, economic and/or legal environment occur, there can be no assurance that all or any part of such strategy and/or initiatives will not be abandoned or amended to take account of such changes. Any such adjustment or abandonment may have an adverse effect on our securities.\nRisks Related to the Managing General Underwriting Business\nXchange derives a significant portion of its commission revenues from a limited number of insurance companies, the loss of any of which could result in lower commissions or loss of business production.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, a majority of Xchange\u2019s total commissions was derived from insurance policies underwritten by a limited number of insurance companies. Should one or more of these insurance companies terminate its arrangements with Xchange or otherwise decrease the number of insurance policies underwritten for it, Xchange may lose significant commission revenues or lose significant business production while it seeks other insurance companies to underwrite the business.\nXchange\u2019s business, results of operation, financial condition and liquidity may be materially adversely affected by certain potential claims, regulatory actions or proceedings.\nXchange is subject to various potential claims, regulatory actions and other proceedings, including those relating to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement or servicing of insurance and/or the provision of services in the ordinary course of business, of which we cannot, and likely will not be able to, predict the outcome with certainty. Because Xchange often assists customers with matters involving substantial amounts of money, including the placement of insurance and the handling of related claims that customers may assert, errors and omissions, claims against it may arise alleging potential liability for all or part of the amounts in question. Also, the failure of an insurer with whom Xchange places business could result in errors and omissions claims against it by its customers, which could adversely affect Ambac\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. Claimants may seek large damage awards, and these claims may involve potentially significant legal costs and damages. In addition, regardless of monetary costs, these matters could have a material adverse effect on Xchange's reputation and cause harm to its carrier, customer or employee relationships, or divert personnel and management resources.\nXchange\u2019s current market share may decrease because of disintermediation within the insurance industry, including increased competition from insurance companies, technology companies and the financial services industry, as well as the shift away from traditional insurance markets.\nThe MGU business is highly competitive and Xchange actively competes with numerous firms for customers and insurance\ncompanies, many of which have relationships with insurance companies or have a significant presence in niche insurance markets that may give them an advantage over it. Other competitive concerns may include the quality of Xchange\u2019s products and services, its pricing and the entrance of technology companies into the MGU business. A number of insurance companies are engaged in the direct sale of insurance and do not pay commissions to agents and brokers. In addition, and to the extent that banks, securities firms, private equity funds, and insurance companies affiliate, the financial services industry may experience further consolidation, and Xchange therefore may experience increased competition from insurance companies and the financial services industry, as a growing number of larger financial institutions increasingly, and aggressively, offer a wider variety of financial services, including MGU services. While Xchange collaborates and competes in these segments on a fee-for-service basis, we cannot be certain that such alternative markets will provide the same level of insurance coverage or profitability as traditional insurance markets.\nChanges in law or in the functioning of the healthcare market could significantly impair Xchange\u2019s business and therefore negatively impact Ambac\u2019s financial condition and results of operation.\nAdoption of a single payer healthcare system or a public health insurance option would likely adversely impact the entire healthcare industry. While Xchange has historically demonstrated an ability to adjust its products to major changes in the healthcare industry, given its focus on A&H products, Xchange would likely be adversely impacted by such a material change in the U.S. healthcare system particularly if private health insurance is eliminated, materially limited, or is rendered noncompetitive. Material adverse developments to Xchange's business would have a negative impact on Ambac's financial condition and results of operations which could be material.\nXchange\u2019s business and results of operation and financial condition may be adversely affected by conditions that result in reduced insurer capacity.\nXchange\u2019s results of operations depend on the continued capacity of insurance carriers to underwrite risk and provide coverage, which depends in turn on those insurance companies\u2019 ability to procure reinsurance. Capacity could also be reduced by insurance companies failing or withdrawing from writing certain coverages that Xchange offers to its customers. Xchange has no control over these matters. To the extent that reinsurance becomes less widely available or significantly more expensive, Xchange may not be able to procure the amount or types of coverage that its customers desire and the coverage Xchange is able to procure for its customers may be more expensive or limited.\nVariations in Xchange\u2019s commissions that result from the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production may have unexpected effects on our results of operation.\nXchange\u2019s commission income can vary quarterly or annually due to the timing of policy renewals and the net effect of new and lost business production. Xchange does not control the factors that cause these variations. Specifically, customers\u2019 demand for insurance products can influence the timing of\n| Ambac Financial Group, Inc. 23 2020 FORM 10-K |\nrenewals, new business and lost business (which includes policies that are not renewed), and cancellations. Quarterly and annual fluctuations in revenues based upon increases and decreases associated with the timing of new business, policy renewals and payments from insurance companies may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Profit-sharing contingent commissions are paid by insurance companies based upon the profitability of the business placed with such companies. In the past these commissions have accounted for a material amount of Xchange\u2019s total commissions and fees. Due to, among other things, the inherent uncertainty of loss in Xchange\u2019s industry and changes in underwriting criteria by insurance companies, there will be a level of uncertainty related to the payment of profit-sharing contingent commissions.", "PERMNO": 76757, "SIC": 6351, "TIC": "AMBC"}
