Risk Factors\nEconomic and Industry Risks\nDownturns in the general economy or the commercial and residential construction industries may adversely affect our revenues and operating results.\nGeneral economic downturns, including downturns in the commercial and residential construction industries, could result in a material decrease in our revenues and operating results. Demand for many of our products, especially in the commercial construction industry, is cyclical. Sales of our products are sensitive to the states of the U.S., foreign and regional economies in general, and in particular, changes in commercial construction spending and government infrastructure spending. In addition, many of our costs are fixed and cannot be quickly reduced in response to decreased demand. The following factors could cause a downturn in the commercial and residential construction industries:\n\u25cf a decrease in the availability of funds for construction;\n\u25cf declining economy domestically and internationally;\n\u25cf labor disputes in the construction industry causing work stoppages;\n\u25cf rising gas and oil prices;\n\u25cf rising steel prices and steel surcharges;\n\u25cf rising interest rates;\n\u25cf energy or building materials shortages;\n\u25cf inclement weather; and\n\u25cf availability of credit for customers.\nDownturns in the general economy and restrictions in the credit markets may negatively impact our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position and access to financing sources by the Company and our customers.\nWorldwide economic conditions and the international credit markets significantly deteriorated in recent years and may remain depressed for the foreseeable future. Continued deterioration of economic conditions and credit markets could adversely impact our earnings as sales of our products are sensitive to general declines in U.S. and foreign economies and the ability of our customers to obtain credit. In addition, we rely on the capital markets and the banking markets to meet our financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from our operations. Further disruptions in the capital and credit markets, or deterioration of our creditors' financial condition, could adversely affect the Company's ability to draw on its revolving credit facility. The Company\u2019s current credit facility, as amended in February 2019, expires in December 2023, and deterioration in the credit markets could make it more difficult or expensive for us to replace our current credit facility, enter into a new credit facility or obtain additional financing.\nA decrease or delay in government funding of highway construction and maintenance may cause our revenues and profits to decrease.\nMany of our customers depend on government funding of highway construction and maintenance and other infrastructure projects. Any decrease or delay in government funding of highway construction and maintenance and other infrastructure projects could cause our net sales and profits to decrease. Historically, federal government funding of infrastructure projects has typically been accomplished through bills that establish funding over a multi-year period, such as the Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act - A Legacy for Users (\u201cSAFETEA-LU\u201d), which provided $286.5 billion to fund federal transit projects from 2004 to 2009. SAFETEA-LU funding expired on September 30, 2009, and federal transportation funding operated on a number of shorter term appropriations until December 4, 2015 when the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act (\u201cFAST Act\u201d) was enacted. Among other expenditures, the FAST Act approved funding for highways of approximately $205 billion and funding for transit projects of approximately $48 billion for the five-year period ending September 30, 2020.\nGiven the inherent uncertainty in the political process, the level of government funding for federal highway projects will similarly continue to be uncertain. Governmental funding that is committed or earmarked for federal highway projects is always subject to repeal or reduction. Although continued funding under the FAST Act is expected, it may be at lower levels than originally approved. In addition, Congress could pass legislation in future sessions that would allow for the diversion of previously appropriated highway funds for other national purposes, or it could restrict funding of infrastructure projects unless states comply with certain federal policies.\nThe cyclical nature of our industry and the customization of the equipment we sell may cause adverse fluctuations to our revenues and operating results.\nWe sell equipment primarily to contractors whose demand for equipment depends greatly upon the volume of road or utility construction projects underway or to be scheduled by both government and private entities. The volume and frequency of road and utility construction projects are cyclical; therefore, demand for many of our products is cyclical. The equipment we sell is durable and typically lasts for several years, which also contributes to the cyclical nature of the demand for our products. As a result, we may experience cyclical fluctuations to our revenues and operating results. Any difficulty in managing the Company\u2019s manufacturing workflow during downturns in demand could adversely affect our financial results.\nA significant change in the price or availability of oil could reduce demand for our products. Significant increases in the purchase price of certain raw materials used to manufacture our equipment could have a negative impact on the cost of production and related gross margins.\nA significant portion of our revenues relates to the sale of equipment involved in the production, handling, recycling or installation of asphalt mix. Liquid asphalt is a byproduct of the refining of oil, and asphalt prices correlate with the price and availability of oil. An increase in the price of oil or a decrease in the availability of oil would increase the cost of producing asphalt, which would likely decrease demand for asphalt, resulting in decreased demand for many of our products. This would likely cause our revenues and profits to decrease. Rising gasoline, diesel fuel and liquid asphalt prices will also adversely impact the operating and raw material costs of our contractor and aggregate producer customers, and if such customers do not properly adjust their pricing, they could experience reduced profits resulting in possible delays in purchasing capital equipment.\nThe products manufactured by the Company\u2019s Energy Group, which are used in drilling for oil and natural gas, in heaters for refineries and oil sands, and in double fluid pump trailers for fracking and oil and gas extraction, would be negatively impacted by lower oil and natural gas prices, to the extent that such lower prices lead to decreased development in the those industries. The Company is in the process of discontinuing its GEFCO oil and gas product line and disposing of all of GEFCO\u2019s oil and gas related inventories, with an expected completion date of mid-2020.\nSteel is a major component in the Company\u2019s equipment. Steel prices fluctuate routinely. Our reliance on third-party suppliers for steel and other raw materials exposes us to volatility in the prices and availability of these materials. Price increases or a decrease in the availability of these raw materials could increase our operating costs and adversely affect our financial results.\nFor raw materials that we source internationally, any changes to international trade policies could result in additional tariffs, duties or other charges which could significantly increase the costs of such materials and negatively impact our costs and related gross margins.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could affect our operating results.\nWe are exposed to risk as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates from transactions involving foreign operations and currencies. Because we prepare our financial statements and projections using the U.S. dollar as our reporting currency, we have to convert international assets, liabilities and other financial statement components into U.S. dollars using applicable exchange rates. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates could negatively affect our financial results and cause such results to differ materially from those anticipated in our projections. Further, changes in foreign currency exchange rates that weaken the U.S. dollar\u2019s position vis-\u00e0-vis a foreign currency could affect our operating results and financial condition, and may also affect the demand for our products in international markets if our foreign competitors are able to offer products at a lower cost as a result of the current exchange rate in such jurisdiction.\nOperational Risks\nOur quarterly operating results are likely to fluctuate, which may decrease our stock price.\nOur quarterly revenues, expenses and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future. As a result, our operating results in some quarters may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock. The reasons our quarterly results may fluctuate include:\n\u25cf general competitive and economic conditions, domestically and internationally;\n\u25cf delays in, or uneven timing in, the delivery of customer orders;\n\u25cf the seasonal trend in our industry;\n\u25cf the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf product supply shortages; and\n\u25cf reduced demand due to adverse weather conditions.\nPeriod-to-period comparisons of such items should not be relied on as indications of future performance.\nWe may face product liability claims due to the nature of our business. If we are unable to obtain or maintain insurance or if our insurance does not cover such liabilities, we may incur significant costs which could reduce our profitability.\nWe manufacture heavy machinery, which is used by our customers at excavation and construction sites, ports and inland terminals and on high-traffic roads. Any defect in or improper operation of our equipment can result in personal injury and death, and damage to or destruction of property, any of which could cause product liability claims to be filed against us. The amount and scope of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities we may incur in the event of a product liability claim. We may not be able to maintain insurance of the types or at the levels we deem necessary or adequate or at rates we consider reasonable. Any liabilities not covered by insurance could reduce our profitability or have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to a variety of other legal proceedings.\nFrom time to time, the Company may be involved in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. We are unable predict when claims or matters will arise and the extent to which they will affect our business, and the international nature of our business exposes us to legal and regulatory matters that arise in foreign jurisdictions as well. We could incur significant expenses to administer and defend such matters, and any judgments or fines imposed on the Company could significantly impact our financial condition. Developments in our ongoing legal matters could also affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments in excess of our reserves, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. These matters could also significantly divert the attention of our management.\nIf we are unable to protect our proprietary technology from infringement or if our technology infringes technology owned by others, then the demand for our products may decrease or we may be forced to modify our products, which could increase our costs.\nWe hold numerous patents covering technology and applications related to many of our products and systems, as well as numerous trademarks and trade names registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in foreign countries. Our existing or future patents or trademarks may not adequately protect us against infringements, and pending patent or trademark applications may not result in issued patents or trademarks. Our patents, registered trademarks and patent applications, if any, may not be upheld if challenged, and competitors may develop similar or superior methods or products outside the protection of our patents. This could reduce demand for our products and materially decrease our revenues. If our products are deemed to infringe upon the patents or proprietary rights of others, we could be required to modify the design of our products, change the name of our products or obtain a license for the use of some of the technologies used in our products. We may be unable to do any of the foregoing in a timely manner, upon acceptable terms and conditions, or at all, and the failure to do so could cause us to incur additional costs or lose revenues.\nWe rely heavily on our information technology. If the information systems we use fail or are interrupted, it could negatively affect our business, reputation and operating results.\nThe failure of our information technology systems or those of our business partners and suppliers to work property and in a timely manner could disrupt our business operations and negatively affect operating results. We rely on both internal technology and systems managed or hosted by third parties to support a variety of business activities and processes, including communications with our personnel, suppliers and customers, and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. Disruption of those systems could significantly harm our ability to process orders and service our customers, procure materials from our suppliers, effectively communicate within the Company and perform daily operations that are critical to the success of our business, all of which could negatively affect our business, reputation and results of operations.\nIncreased cybersecurity requirements, vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions, services and data.\nIncreased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats, computer viruses and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks, as well as cybersecurity failures resulting from human error and technological errors, pose a risk to the security of the Company\u2019s and its customers\u2019, partners\u2019, suppliers\u2019 and third-party service providers\u2019 products, systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the Company\u2019s and its customers\u2019 data. Despite our efforts to protect our systems and confidential information, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced, lost or corrupted data, programming errors, employee errors and/or misappropriation that could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, any of which could have a material effect on our business.\nIf we become subject to increased governmental regulation, we may incur significant costs.\nOur hot-mix asphalt plants contain air pollution control equipment and several of our other products contain engines that must comply with performance standards promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency. These performance standards may increase in the future. Changes in these requirements could cause us to undertake costly measures to redesign or modify our equipment or otherwise adversely affect the manufacturing processes of our products. Such changes could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIn addition, we may incur material costs or liabilities in connection with other regulatory requirements applicable to our business, including, for example, state regulation of our component equipment, the accuracy of weights and measures, and the maximum weight transportable on highways and roads.\nAcquisitions that we have made in the past, future acquisitions and start-up operations involve risks that could adversely affect our future financial results.\nWe have completed several acquisitions in the past, including the acquisition of RexCon in October 2017, and we have started new operations, including the start-up of Astec Brazil and Astec LatAm in recent years. We may acquire additional businesses or start up other operations in the future. We may be unable to achieve the benefits expected to be realized from our acquisitions or business start-ups. In addition, we may incur additional costs and our management's attention may be diverted because of unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other risks inherent in acquiring businesses, including the following:\n\u25cf we may have difficulty integrating the financial and administrative functions of new businesses;\n\u25cf new or added operations may divert management's attention from our existing operations;\n\u25cf fluctuations in exchange rates and a weakening of the dollar may impact the competitiveness of acquired businesses;\n\u25cf we may have difficulty in competing successfully for available acquisition candidates, completing future acquisitions or accurately estimating the financial effect of any businesses we acquire;\n\u25cf we may have delays in realizing the benefits of our strategies for an acquired business or new operation;\n\u25cf we may not be able to retain key employees necessary to continue the operations of the acquired business;\n\u25cf acquisition costs may deplete significant cash amounts or may decrease our operating income;\n\u25cf we may choose to acquire a company that is less profitable or has lower profit margins than our Company;\n\u25cf future acquired companies may have unknown liabilities that could require us to spend significant amounts of additional capital; and\n\u25cf we may incur domestic or international economic declines that impact our acquired companies.\nCompetition could reduce revenue from our products and services and cause us to lose market share, and our ability to compete in international jurisdictions is dependent upon trade policies, which are subject to change.\nWe currently face strong competition in product performance, price and service. Some of our domestic and international competitors have greater financial, product development and marketing resources than we have. If competition in our industry intensifies or if our current competitors enhance their products or lower their prices for competing products, we may lose sales or be required to lower the prices we charge for our products. This may reduce revenue from our products and services, lower our gross margins or cause us to lose market share. In addition to the general competitive challenges we face, international trade policies could negatively affect the demand for our products and services and reduce our competitive position in such markets. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as higher tariffs, duties or charges, in countries where we operate could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to attract and retain members of our executive team, management and other key employees, as well as the success of initiatives implemented by such individuals within the Company, are critical to our Company achieving positive outcomes.\nCertain members of our senior management team are of significant importance to our business and operations. The loss of their services may adversely affect our business. During 2019, we experienced turnover in several key management positions, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer positions. Similar management changes in the future could materially affect our business. In addition, our ability to attract and retain qualified engineers, skilled manufacturing personnel and other professionals, either through direct hiring or acquisition of other businesses employing such professionals, will also be an important factor in determining our future success.\nFurther, our success also depends on the decision and strategic initiatives implemented by our senior management and executive officers. Currently, our Chief Executive Officer has implemented a new management structure for the Company, whereby the Company is moving to a more centralized management model. If this revised management structure does not succeed or is not implemented in a timely manner, our results of operations could be significantly affected and we risk our ability to retain senior management.\nOur expansion into international markets could divert management's attention from our existing operations and expose us to increased risks with respect to violation of international anti-corruption laws.\nIn 2019, international sales represented approximately 22.3% of our total sales as compared to 21.8% in 2018. We plan to continue increasing our already significant sales and production efforts in international markets. In furtherance thereof, we recently opened a new sales/service operation in Chile and are in process of opening similar operations in India and Thailand. In connection with any increase in international sales efforts, we will need to hire, train and retain qualified personnel in countries where language, cultural or regulatory barriers may exist. Any difficulties in expanding our international sales may divert management\u2019s attention from our existing operations. In addition, international revenues are subject to the following risks:\n\u25cf fluctuating currency exchange rates, which can reduce the profitability of foreign sales;\n\u25cf the burden of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations;\n\u25cf dependence on foreign sales agents;\n\u25cf political and economic instability of governments;\n\u25cf the imposition of protective legislation such as import or export barriers; and\n\u25cf fluctuating strengths or weakness of the dollar, which can impact net sales or the cost of purchased products.\nAdditionally, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar international anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The continued expansion of our international operations could increase the risk of violations of these laws in the future. Significant violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could harm our reputation, disrupt our business, and result in significant fines and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nFinancial Risks\nWe may be unsuccessful in complying with the financial ratio covenants or other provisions of our credit agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the financial covenants contained in our credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. However, in the future we may be unable to comply with the financial covenants in our credit facility or to obtain waivers with respect to such financial covenants. If such violations occur, the Company\u2019s creditors could elect to pursue their contractual remedies under the credit facility, including requiring immediate repayment in full of all amounts then outstanding. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had no borrowings, but did have $8,335 in letters of credit outstanding under the under the Wells Fargo credit agreement. We may borrow additional amounts under the credit agreement in the future. The Company\u2019s Osborn, Astec Brazil, Telestack and Astec Australia subsidiaries have entered into their own independent loan agreements with other lending institutions.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, and changes to the tax codes, effective tax rates and accounting principles related thereto could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions. Our results of operations could be adversely affected by, among other things, changes in the effective tax rates in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, a change in the mix of earnings between U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions or among jurisdictions with differing tax rates, changes in tax laws or treaties, and related changes in generally accepted accounting principles. Additionally, the Company typically incurs substantial research and development costs each year and has historically received significant research and development tax credits due to these expenditures. Congress could reduce or eliminate such tax credits in future years, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets comprise a material portion of our total assets. We must test our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment at least annually, which could result in a material, non-cash write-down of goodwill or intangible assets and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nGoodwill and intangible assets are subject to impairment assessments at least annually (or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred). During 2019, the Company\u2019s testing indicated no impairment had occurred; however, in 2018, we recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling $11,190 at two of our business units. A decrease in our market capitalization, profitability or negative or declining cash flows increases the risk of goodwill or other intangible asset impairments. Future impairment charges could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nAs an innovative leader in the industries in which we operate, we occasionally undertake the engineering, design, manufacturing, construction and installation of equipment systems that are new to the market. Estimating the costs of such innovative equipment can be difficult and could result in our realization of significantly reduced or negative margins on such projects. Additionally, if the newly designed equipment were not to function as expected, the Company could be responsible for reimbursing the customer for its financial losses, including, but not limited to, the possible refund of the purchase price.\nAt various times, we have experienced negative margins on certain large projects, including wood pellet plants that we have previously produced. These large projects have included both existing and innovative equipment designs, on-site construction and promised minimum production levels. Designing innovative equipment to function as expected is inherently difficult and significant additional design phase, field testing and redesign costs may be incurred. In addition, any number of unforeseen circumstances can impact actual project costs. Production delays, design changes and adverse weather conditions, and other factors can also result in construction and testing delays, which can cause significant cost overruns or failure to meet required completion dates. In certain circumstances, we may incur contractual penalties as a result of such delays or the failure to satisfy minimum production levels, and we may be liable to customers for other losses they incur in connection with such delays, including possible refund of the purchase price. We may not be able to sufficiently predict the extent of such unforeseen cost overruns and may experience significant losses on specialized projects in the future.\nThe Coronavirus outbreak or similar other health related outbreaks in the future could impact or business operations and financial condition.\nThe ongoing coronavirus outbreak emanating from China at the beginning of 2020 has resulted in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdown of certain businesses in the region and elsewhere, and could similarly impact additional regions of the world. These or any further political or governmental developments or health concerns in China or other countries could result in social, economic and labor instability. These uncertainties could have a material impact on our business operations and financial condition by restricting our ability to timely source certain raw materials needed in the production of our products or limit our ability to sustain or grow our revenues from sales to customers in the regions or elsewhere.\nRisks Related to Investing in our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock fluctuates and it may be difficult to resell shares at desirable prices.\nThe trading price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate. Our stock price may fluctuate in response to the risk factors set forth herein, and our stock price volatility and trading volume may make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their Company shares when desired and at a price acceptable to them.\nThere is no assurance that the Company will continue to declare dividends or have the available cash to make dividend payments.\nAlthough the Company has routinely declared dividends since 2012, we cannot assure our stockholders that we will continue to declare dividends or that funds will continue to be available for this purpose in the future. The declaration and payment of dividends are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend upon the Company\u2019s profitability, financial condition, capital needs, future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.\nOur Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and Tennessee law may inhibit a takeover, which could delay or prevent a transaction in which shareholders might receive a premium over market price for their shares.\nOur charter and bylaws and Tennessee law contain provisions that may delay, deter or inhibit a future acquisition or an attempt to obtain control of us. This could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if a substantial number or even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest. These provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us or obtaining control of us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our Board of Directors in connection with the transaction. Provisions that could delay, deter or inhibit a future acquisition or an attempt to obtain control of us include the following:\n\u25cf having a staggered Board of Directors;\n\u25cf requiring a two-thirds vote of the total number of shares issued and outstanding to remove directors other than for cause;\n\u25cf requiring advance notice of actions proposed by shareholders for consideration at shareholder meetings;\n\u25cf limiting the right of shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders;\n\u25cf requiring that all shareholders entitled to vote on an action provide written consent in order for shareholders to act without holding a shareholders\u2019 meeting; and\n\u25cf being governed by the Tennessee Control Share Acquisition Act.\nWe identified material weaknesses in our internal controls which, if not remediated appropriately or timely, could result in loss of investor confidence and adversely impact our stock price.\nAs disclosed in Part II, Item 9A, during 2019 and 2018, management identified certain material weaknesses in internal controls that are relevant to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. As a result, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. We are implementing remedial measures and, while there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful, we plan to remediate the material weaknesses prior to the end of 2020. These measures may result in additional technology and other expenses. If we are unable to remediate the material weaknesses, or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare consolidated financial statements within required time periods, could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our consolidated financial statements and adversely impact our stock price.", "PERMNO": 10382, "SIC": 3531, "TIC": "ASTE"}
