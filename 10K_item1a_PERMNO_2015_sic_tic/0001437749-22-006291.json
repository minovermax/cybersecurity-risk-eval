{"cik": "1713832", "company": "HyreCar Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as general economic and business risks and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The occurrence of any of the events or circumstances described below or other adverse events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. Additional risks or uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and prospects and may increase the risks associated with your investment.\nWe were founded in 2014. Our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and prospects and plan for and model our future growth. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by rapidly growing companies in developing markets. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties are incorrect or change in response to changes in the ridesharing or car-sharing market, our results of operations and financial results could differ materially from our plans and forecasts. Although we have experienced periods of rapid growth since our inception, there is no assurance that such growth will continue. Any success we may experience in the future will depend in large part on our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf\nmaintain and expand our customer base (drivers and owners) and the ways in which customers use our platform;\n\u25cf\nexpand revenue from existing customers through increased or broader use of our platform;\n\u25cf\nimprove the performance and capabilities of our platform through research and development;\n\u25cf\neffectively expand our business domestically and internationally, which will require that we rapidly expand our sales force and retain/fill key management positions; and\n\u25cf\nsuccessfully compete with other companies that currently provide, or may in the future provide, solutions like ours.\nIf we are unable to achieve our key objectives, including the objectives listed above, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected, and the value of our securities could decline.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has at times disrupted and harmed, and is expected to continue to disrupt and harm, our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic and related impacts will continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and the achievement of our strategic objectives.\nOur business, operations and financial performance have at times been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health responses, such as travel bans, travel restrictions and shelter-in-place orders that were implemented in various jurisdictions from time to time. The pandemic and these related responses have at times caused, and could potentially cause, at least temporarily, decreased demand for our platform relative to pre-COVID-19 demand, a slowdown of economic activity (including a decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods and services), disruptions in global supply chains, and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our operations, financial performance and financial condition to a number of risks, including, but not limited to those discussed below:\n\u25cf\nDeclines in travel as a result COVID-19, including commuting, local travel, and business and leisure travel, has at times resulted in decreased demand for our platform which has decreased our anticipated revenue growth trajectory. During certain periods in the past, these factors have led to a decrease in earning opportunities for drivers on our platform. Changes in transportation trends and behavior arising from COVID-19 may continue to develop or persist over time and further contribute to this adverse effect.\n\u25cf\nChanges in driver behavior arising from COVID-19 have, at times, led to reduced levels of driver availability on our platform. To the extent that driver availability is limited, our service levels may be negatively impacted, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\n\u25cf\nThe responsive measures to the COVID-19 pandemic have caused us to modify our business practices by having employees work remotely or holding virtual meetings regularly. We may in the future be required to or choose voluntarily to take actions for the health and safety of our workforce, whether in response to government orders or based on our own determinations of what is in the best interests of our employees or users of our platform. The effects of the pandemic, including remote working arrangements for employees, may also impact our financial reporting systems and internal control over financial reporting, including our ability to ensure information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. To the extent these measures result in decreased productivity, harm our company culture, adversely affect our ability to maintain internal controls, or otherwise negatively affect our business, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur results of operations vary and are unpredictable from period-to-period, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nOur results of operations have historically varied from period-to-period and we expect that our results of operations will continue to do so for a variety of reasons, many of which are outside of our control and difficult to predict. Because our results of operations may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, the results of any one period should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. We have presented many of the factors that may cause our results of operations to fluctuate in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Fluctuations in our results of operations may cause such results to fall below our financial guidance or other projections, or the expectations of analysts or investors, which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\nThe ridesharing market and the market for our service offerings are still in relatively early stages of growth and if such markets do not continue to grow, grow more slowly than we expect or fail to grow as large as we expect, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe ridesharing market has grown rapidly since we launched our car-sharing marketplace in 2014, but it is still relatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to grow. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of people to widely-adopt car-sharing and ride-sharing generally. We cannot be certain whether the on-going COVID-19 pandemic will from time to time negatively impact the willingness of drivers or passengers to participate in ridesharing or otherwise adversely affect demand for our services. If the public does not perceive ridesharing as beneficial, or chooses not to adopt it as a result of concerns regarding public health or safety, affordability or for other reasons, whether as a result of incidents on Lyft or Uber or similar platforms, the on-going COVID-19 pandemic, or otherwise, then the market for our services may not further develop, may develop more slowly than we expect or may not achieve the growth potential we expect. Additionally, from time to time we may re-evaluate the markets in which we operate, and we have discontinued and may in the future discontinue operations in certain markets as a result of such evaluations. Any of the foregoing risks and challenges could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, many of which are evolving, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws in the United States and other jurisdictions. Laws, regulations and standards governing issues such as transportation network companies (\u201cTNCs\u201d), ridesharing, food and package delivery, worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, product liability, defects, maintenance and repairs, personal injury, text messaging, subscription services, intellectual property, consumer protection, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, arbitration agreements and action waiver provisions, terms of service, mobile application accessibility, autonomous vehicles, bike and scooter sharing, insurance, vehicle rentals, money transmittal, non-emergency medical transportation, environmental health and safety, background checks, public health, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and delivery of goods including (but not limited to) medical supplies, perishable foods and prescription drugs are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity. As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state and local administrative agencies.\nFrom time to time financial, political and other events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies, technology companies in general and companies engaged in dealings with independent contractors, such as ridesharing and delivery companies. Regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to our business, or, due to changes in our operations and structure or partner relationships as a result of changes in the market or otherwise, they may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to our business. For example, Assembly Bill 5 (as codified in part at Cal. Labor Code sec. 2750.3) codified and extended an employment classification test in Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v. Superior Court, which established a new standard for determining employee or independent contractor status. The passage of this bill led to additional challenges to the independent contractor classification of drivers using the Lyft and Uber platforms.\nChanges in tax treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce may adversely affect the commercial use of our sites and our financial results.\nDue to the global nature of the Internet, it is possible that various states might attempt to impose additional or new regulation on our business or levy additional or new sales, income or other taxes relating to our activities. Tax authorities at the federal, state and local levels are currently reviewing the appropriate treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce and digital services. New or revised international, federal, state or local tax regulations or court decisions may subject us or our customers to additional sales, income and other taxes. For example, on June 21, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court rendered a decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., where the Court held, among other things, that a state may require an out-of-state seller with no physical presence in the state to collect and remit sales taxes on goods the seller ships to consumers in the state, overturning existing court precedent. Other new or revised taxes and, in particular, digital taxes, sales taxes, VAT and similar taxes could increase the cost of doing business online and decrease the attractiveness of selling products services over the Internet. New taxes and rulings could also create significant increases in internal costs necessary to capture data and collect and remit taxes. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur revenue growth rate and financial performance in recent periods may not be indicative of future performance and such revenue growth rate or growth in demand for our offerings may slow over time.\nWe have grown rapidly over the last several years, however our recent revenue growth rate and financial performance should not be considered indicative of our future performance. Moreover, as our revenue has grown so have our cost and expenses, and, to date, we have never been cash flow positive. Our growth trajectory may accelerate or decelerate as a results of numerous factors including market conditions, quality of managerial execution, technological factors, insurance premium volatility and various other conditions that may affect performance.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to manage our growth and business operations effectively and to integrate new employees, technologies and acquisitions into our existing business will require us to continue to expand our operational and financial infrastructure and to continue to retain, attract, train, motivate and manage employees. Continued growth could strain our ability to develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and procedures, recruit, train and retain highly skilled personnel and maintain user satisfaction. Additionally, if we do not effectively manage the growth of our business and operations, the quality of our offerings could suffer and we would not fully realize economies of scale, which could negatively affect our reputation and brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny actual or perceived security or privacy breach could interrupt our operations, harm our brand and adversely affect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business involves the collection, storage, processing and transmission of our users\u2019 personal data and other sensitive data. An increasing number of organizations, including large online and off-line merchants and businesses, other large Internet companies, financial institutions and government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their information security systems and other information security incidents, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks. In addition, users on our platform could have vulnerabilities on their own mobile devices that are entirely unrelated to our systems and platform, but could mistakenly attribute their own vulnerabilities to us. Further, breaches experienced by other companies may also be leveraged against us. For example, credential stuffing attacks are becoming increasingly common and sophisticated actors can mask their attacks, making them increasingly difficult to identify and prevent. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored or supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more difficult to detect.\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal data, could adversely affect our business.\nWe receive, transmit and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other data relating to the users on our platform. Numerous local, municipal, state, and federal laws and regulations address privacy, data protection and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of certain types of data, including the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the U.S. Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, Section 5(c) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, and the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which becomes operative on January 1, 2023. These laws, rules and regulations evolve frequently and their scope may continually change, through new legislation, amendments to existing legislation and changes in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. For example, the CPRA will require new disclosures to California consumers and affords such consumers new data rights and abilities to opt-out of certain sharing of personal information. The CPRA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per violation, which can be applied on a per-consumer basis. Aspects of the CPRA and its interpretation and enforcement remain unclear. The effects of this legislation potentially are far-reaching, however, and may require us to further modify our data processing practices and policies and incur additional compliance-related costs and expenses. The CPRA and other changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security, particularly any new or modified laws or regulations that require enhanced protection of certain types of data or new obligations with regard to data retention, transfer or disclosure, could greatly increase the cost of providing our offerings, require significant changes to our operations or even prevent us from providing certain offerings in jurisdictions in which we currently operate and in which we may operate in the future.\nOur business is heavily reliant upon information technology systems, some of which are managed, hosted, provided or used by third parties, including cloud-based service providers, and any significant failures or disruptions to these systems could adversely impact our business.\nOur ability to, among other things, operate our platform, process rental transactions, manage our pricing, account for our activities and otherwise conduct our business is dependent on the performance and availability of our networks and systems, as well as those of third-party cloud providers. We have experienced, and from time to time in the future may experience, a failure or interruption that results in the unavailability of certain information systems. Additionally, our major information technology systems and accounting functions are centralized in a few locations. Any disruption, termination or substandard provision of services, including by third-party cloud providers, whether as the result of localized conditions (e.g., fire, explosion or hacking), failure of our systems to function as designed, or as the result of events or circumstances of broader geographic impact (e.g., earthquake, storm, flood, epidemic, strike, act of war, civil unrest or terrorist act), could materially adversely affect our business by disrupting normal operations, customer service, accounting and technology functions; interfering with our ability to manage vehicle supply; delaying or disrupting rental processes; and otherwise impacting our ability to manage our business. These events could, individually or in the aggregate, lead to lower revenues, increased costs or other effects on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows, which may be material.\nOperating as a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention. In addition, certain members of our management team have limited experience managing a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing standards of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. For example, the Exchange Act requires, among other things, we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are also required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, and increase demand on our systems. In addition, as a public company, we may be subject to stockholder activism, which can lead to additional substantial costs, distract management and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. As a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition is more visible than a private company, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors.\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen potential drivers, and if such providers fail to provide accurate information, or if providers are unable to complete background checks because of court closures or other unforeseen government shutdown, or we do not maintain business relationships with them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on third-party background check providers such as Checkr to screen the records of potential drivers to help identify those that are not qualified to utilize our platform pursuant to applicable law or our internal standards. Our business has and may continue to be adversely affected to the extent we cannot attract or retain qualified drivers as a result of such providers being unable to complete certain background checks, or to the extent that they do not meet their contractual obligations, our expectations or the requirements of applicable law or regulations. If any of our third-party background check providers terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we may need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable time frame. If we cannot find alternate third-party background check providers on terms acceptable to us, we may not be able to timely onboard potential drivers, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive to qualified drivers. Further, if the background checks conducted by our third-party background check providers do not meet our expectations or the requirements under applicable laws and regulations, unqualified drivers may be permitted to provide rides on our platform, and as a result, our reputation and brand could be adversely affected and we could be subject to increased regulatory or litigation exposure.\nWe could be subject to claims from TNCs, delivery drivers or third parties that are harmed whether or not resulting from the use of our platform, which could adversely affect our business, brand, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations and other legal proceedings relating to injuries to, or deaths of, TNCs and delivery drivers or third-parties, as applicable, that are attributed to us through our services. We may also be subject to claims alleging that we are directly or vicariously liable for the acts of the drivers on our platform or for harm related to the actions of drivers, TNC riders, or third parties, or the management and safety of the services offered through our platform. We may also be subject to personal injury claims whether or not such injury actually occurred as a result any service provided through our platform. For example, third parties have in the past asserted legal claims against us in connection with personal injuries related to the actions of a driver or rider who may have previously utilized our platform, but, was not at the time of such injury. Regardless of the outcome of any legal proceeding, any injuries to, or deaths of, any TNC riders, drivers or third parties could result in negative publicity and harm to our brand, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may require additional capital, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nWe evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans and operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have had operating losses each year and quarterly period since our inception and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred operating losses each year and every quarterly period since inception. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our operating loss was $27,977,239 and $15,252,689 respectively. We expect our operating expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the future as we curtail expenditures by optimizing our cost structure our G&A, sales and marketing, and research and development expenses. Our revenue growth may slow or our revenue may decline for a number of other reasons, including reduced demand for our services, economic weakness, global macroeconomic shocks such as the recent coronavirus outbreak, increased competition, a decrease in the growth or size of the ride-sharing or car-sharing market or any failure to capitalize on growth opportunities. Any failure to increase our revenue as we grow our business could prevent us from achieving or maintaining profitability. If we are unable to meet these risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nIf we do not respond appropriately, the evolution of the automotive industry towards autonomous vehicles and mobility on demand services could adversely affect our business.\nThe automotive industry is increasingly focused on the development of advanced driver assistance technologies, with the goal of developing and introducing a commercially viable, fully automated driving experience. The high development cost of active safety and autonomous driving technologies may result in a higher risk of exposure to the success of new or disruptive technologies different than those being developed by us. There has also been an increase in consumer preferences for mobility on demand services, such as car and ridesharing, as opposed to automobile ownership, which may result in a long-term reduction in the number of vehicles per capita. These evolving areas have also attracted increased competition from entrants outside the traditional automotive industry. If we do not continue to innovate to develop or acquire new and compelling products and service offerings that capitalize upon new technologies in response to consumer preferences, this could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nIf we do not effectively expand and train our direct sales force, we may be unable to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers, and our business will be adversely affected.\nWe continue to be substantially dependent on our direct sales force to obtain new customers and increase sales with existing customers. There is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth. New hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity. Our hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. In addition, because we continue to grow rapidly, a large percentage of our sales force is new to our company. If we are unable to hire and train a sufficient number of effective sales personnel, or the sales personnel we hire are not successful in obtaining new customers or increasing revenue streams or sales to our existing customer base, our business will be adversely affected.\nUnfavorable global economic, business, or political conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets, including conditions that are outside of our control, including the impact of health and safety concerns, such as those relating to the on-going COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has at times caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for our platform and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nOur current relationships with rideshare (e.g. Uber and Lyft) and delivery companies (e.g. Doordash) could change in the future, which could adversely affect our revenues.\nAlthough we have deployed drivers and cars to the systems of Uber, Lyft and other platforms since our operations began in 2015, the current relationships in place (written, oral or tacit), including our vehicle rental strategic partnership with Uber, could materially change in the future. Consequently, each of these relationships could be discontinued at some time, which could adversely impact our business plan and results of operations materially.\nThe ride-sharing and delivery models may not continue to grow, which would adversely affect our business.\nOur business and future growth is significantly dependent on the continued success of each of Uber, Lyft, Instacart and other software-based systems that have come into the marketplace to compete with traditional taxicab transportation organizations and other delivery services.\nWhile the effect of those companies has been to decrease the cost and therefore increase the utilization of ride-sharing and delivery services, there can be no assurance that consumer utilization of these systems will continue to grow, or that competition and the resulting price pressure will not undermine the viability of these types of systems, thereby adversely affecting our business.\nOur unique peer to peer structure could be duplicated and our inability to accurately predict user behavior could negatively impact our sales business.\nAlthough to date neither Uber nor Lyft have endeavored to develop a peer-to-peer system to match drivers and car owners as we are doing, there can be no assurance that either one of these companies or other competitors subsequently entering the marketplace will not endeavor to do so, and there can be no assurance that such competition will not have a negative impact on our business.\nFurthermore, although several attempts to match up fleets of cars owned by operators with Uber and Lyft drivers have failed, there can be no assurance that other entities will not enter the marketplace on this basis with economic and logistical models that solve the problems that caused this failure.\nThe market forecasts included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the markets in which we operate achieve growth, we cannot assure you our business will grow at similar rates, if at all.\nGrowth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates, which may not prove to be accurate. Forecasts relating to the expected growth in the ride-sharing market, including the forecasts or projections referenced in this Annual Report, may prove to be inaccurate. Even if the ride-sharing market experiences the forecasted growth, we may not grow our business at similar rates, or at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, the forecasts of market growth included in this Annual Report should not be taken as indicative of our future growth.\nWe rely on third-party insurance policies to insure against auto-related risks of users of our platform. If insurance coverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance providers are unable to meet their obligations, we may not be able to mitigate the risks facing our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe procure third-party insurance policies which provide coverage for both Owners and Drivers on our platform. If the amount of one or more auto-related claims were to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage limits, we may bear the excess liability. Insurance providers have raised premiums and deductibles for many businesses and may do so in the future. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could increase. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if (i) cost per claim, premiums or the number of claims significantly exceeds our historical experience and coverage limits, (ii) we experience a claim in excess of coverage limits, (iii) our insurance providers fail to pay insurance claims, or (iv) we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided.\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen potential drivers, and if such providers fail to provide accurate information, or if providers are unable to complete background checks because of court closures or other unforeseen government shutdown, or we do not maintain business relationships with them, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on third-party background check providers such as Checkr to screen the records of potential drivers to help identify those that are not qualified to utilize our platform pursuant to applicable law or our internal standards. Our business has and may continue to be adversely affected to the extent we cannot attract or retain qualified drivers as a result of such providers being unable to complete certain background checks, or to the extent that they do not meet their contractual obligations, our expectations or the requirements of applicable law or regulations. If any of our third-party background check providers terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we may need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable time frame. If we cannot find alternate third-party background check providers on terms acceptable to us, we may not be able to timely onboard potential drivers, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive to qualified drivers. Further, if the background checks conducted by our third-party background check providers do not meet our expectations or the requirements under applicable laws and regulations, unqualified drivers may be permitted to provide rides on our platform, and as a result, our reputation and brand could be adversely affected and we could be subject to increased regulatory or litigation exposure.\nWe could be subject to claims from TNCs or delivery drivers or third parties that are harmed whether or not our platform is in use, which could adversely affect our business, brand, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe from time to time may be subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations and other legal proceedings relating to injuries to, or deaths of, TNC and delivery drivers or third-parties, as applicable, that are attributed to us through our offerings. We may also be subject to claims alleging that we are directly or vicariously liable for the acts of the drivers on our platform or for harm related to the actions of drivers, TNC riders, or third parties, or the management and safety of our platform and our assets, including in light of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures issued by various jurisdictions, including travel bans, restrictions, social distancing guidance, and shelter-in-place orders. We may also be subject to personal injury claims whether or not such injury actually occurred as a result of activity on our platform. For example, third parties have in the past asserted legal claims against us in connection with personal injuries related to the actions of a driver or rider who may have previously utilized our platform, but was not at the time of such injury. Regardless of the outcome of any legal proceeding, any injuries to, or deaths of, any TNC riders, drivers or third parties could result in negative publicity and harm to our brand, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur actual losses may exceed our insurance reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe establish insurance reserves for claims incurred but not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported and any related estimable expenses, and we periodically evaluate and, as necessary, adjust our insurance reserves as our experience develops or new information is learned. We employ various predictive modeling actuarial techniques and make numerous assumptions based on limited historical experience and industry statistics to estimate our insurance reserves. Estimating the frequency and severity of claims, as well as related judgment or settlement amounts, is inherently difficult, subjective, and speculative. A number of external factors can affect the actual losses incurred for any given claim, including the length of time the claim remains open, fluctuations in healthcare costs, legislative and regulatory developments, jurisdiction and judicial developments. Additionally, we may encounter in the future, instances of insurance fraud, which could increase our actual insurance-related costs. For any of the foregoing reasons, our actual losses for claims and related expenses may deviate, individually or in the aggregate, from the insurance reserves reflected in our consolidated financial statements. If we determine that our estimated insurance reserves are inadequate, we may be required to increase such reserves at the time of the determination, which could result in an increase to our net loss in the period in which the deficiency is determined and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are dependent on our current management. The loss of any member of our management team could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nWe are highly dependent upon the retention of the services of our current executive management team, specifically Joseph Furnari, Kenneth Grimes, Serge De Bock and Brian Allan. The loss of any one of these individuals could adversely affect our operations and financial results. Our business also depends on our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified management, technical, operating, and sales and marketing personnel. We do not currently maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees. We do not have fixed term employment agreements with any of our management employees, all of whom could terminate their relationship with us at any time.\nWe face intense competition and could lose market share to our competitors, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market for ridesharing and car-sharing services is intensely competitive and characterized by rapid changes in technology, customer requirements, industry standards and frequent new service introductions and improvements. We anticipate continued challenges from current competitors, as well as by new entrants into the industry. If we are unable to anticipate or effectively react to these competitive challenges, our competitive position could weaken, and we could experience a decline in our growth rate or revenue that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAny significant fluctuations in the supply of \u201crental\u201d vehicles available in the market due to unexpected changes in demand, or actions taken by our competitors, could negatively affect our pricing, operating plans or results of operations if we are unable to maintain or adjust the vehicles available on our platform in response to fluctuations in supply and demand. We compete with traditional car rental companies and other traditional providers, as well as non-traditional companies for vehicle rental market share, including auto manufacturers, ride-hailing and other car sharing companies, and other competitors in the mobility industry. To the extent we do not react appropriately to our competition or optimize our revenue and pricing strategies, we may experience sub-optimal pricing, sub-optimal asset utilization, poor customer satisfaction, lost revenue and other unfavorable consequences which may materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations, many of which are evolving, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws in the United States and other jurisdictions. Laws, regulations and standards governing issues such as TNCs, ridesharing, food and package delivery, worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, product liability, defects, maintenance and repairs, personal injury, text messaging, subscription services, intellectual property, consumer protection, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, arbitration agreements and action waiver provisions, terms of service, mobile application accessibility, autonomous vehicles, bike and scooter sharing, insurance, vehicle rentals, money transmittal, non-emergency medical transportation, environmental health and safety, background checks, public health, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and delivery of goods including (but not limited to) medical supplies, perishable foods and prescription drugs are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity. As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state and local administrative agencies.\nRecent financial, political and other events have increased the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies, technology companies in general and companies engaged in dealings with independent contractors, such as ridesharing and delivery companies. Regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to our business, or, due to changes in our operations and structure or partner relationships as a result of changes in the market or otherwise, they may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to our business. For example, Assembly Bill 5 (as codified in part at Cal. Labor Code sec. 2750.3) codified and extended an employment classification test in Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v. Superior Court, which established a new standard for determining employee or independent contractor status. The passage of this bill led to additional challenges to the independent contractor classification of drivers using the Lyft and Uber platforms. In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like Uber and Lyft for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that TNCs will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Legal challenges to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed.\nA security breach or other disruption to our information technology systems or our platform could result in the loss, theft, misuse, or unauthorized disclosure of user or sensitive company information, could disrupt our operations, or could frustrate or thwart our users\u2019 ability to access our products and services, which could damage our relationships with users and partners, may cause our users and partners to cut back on or stop using our products and services altogether, could expose us to litigation or regulatory proceedings, or harm to our reputation, any of which could seriously harm our business.\nOur business involves the storage and transmission of a significant amount of personal and/or confidential information, including the personal information of our users, the personal information of our drivers and employees, information relating to user preferences, confidential information of our partners, and our own proprietary financial, operational and strategic information. The protection of our information, as well as information relating to our users, drivers, partners, and employees, is vitally important to us as the loss, theft, misuse, or unauthorized disclosure of such information could lead to significant reputational or competitive harm, result in litigation involving us or our business partners, expose us to regulatory proceedings, and cause us to incur substantial liability or expenses.\nAs has been well documented in the media, the frequency, intensity, and sophistication of cyber-attacks and data security incidents has significantly increased in recent years. As with many businesses, we are subject to numerous data privacy and security risks, which may prevent us from maintaining the privacy of personal, confidential, and sensitive information, result in the disruption of our business, and require us to expend significant resources attempting to secure and protect such information and respond to incidents, any of which could seriously harm our business. Due to the increased risk of these types of attacks and incidents, we expend significant resources on information technology and data security tools, measures, and processes designed to protect personal, confidential or sensitive information and to ensure an effective response to any cyber-attack or data security incident. Whether or not these measures are ultimately successful, the expenditures could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations and divert management\u2019s attention from pursuing our strategic objectives.\nIn addition, although we take the security of our information technology systems and platform seriously, our efforts to protect the personal and confidential information of our users, drivers, partners, employees, and company may be unsuccessful due to the actions of third parties, malicious code, software bugs, or other technical malfunctions. Despite our security efforts, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to information technology systems and our platform are constantly evolving and, in some cases, becoming more sophisticated and harder to detect, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures in response, and cyber-attacks or data incidents could remain undetected for some period, which could potentially result in greater harm to our systems, our platform, and the information stored and transmitted by our systems. In addition, and despite our security efforts and training, our employees may also inadvertently or intentionally cause security incidents that could result in the unauthorized disclosure of personal or confidential information, and third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information to gain access to our data or our users\u2019 data. If any of these events occur, our confidential information or our users\u2019 personal information could be accessed, acquired, disclosed, or used without authorization, which could harm our relationships with users, put us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the deterioration of our users\u2019 confidence in us, cause our partners to reconsider their relationship with our company or impose more onerous contractual provisions, and subject us to potential litigation, liability, fines, and penalties. For example, we could be subject to regulatory or other actions pursuant to domestic privacy laws, including newer regulations such as the California Consumer Privacy Act. This could result in costly investigations and litigation, civil or criminal penalties, operational changes, and negative publicity that could adversely affect our reputation.\nFurther, some of our partners may store personal or confidential information that we share with them. If these third parties fail to implement adequate data-security practices or fail to comply with our terms and policies, our users\u2019 data may be improperly accessed, acquired, or disclosed. And even if these third parties take all these steps, their networks and information technology systems may still suffer a security breach, which could compromise our users\u2019 data or our company data. Any incidents where our users\u2019 information or confidential company information is accessed without authorization, improperly disclosed, or misused, or incidents that violate our terms of service or policies, could damage our reputation and our brand and diminish our competitive position. Maintaining the trust of our users is important to sustain our growth, retention, and user engagement. Concerns over our privacy practices, whether actual or unfounded, could damage our reputation and brand and deter users, advertisers, and partners from using our products and services. Any of these occurrences could seriously harm our business.\nWe may fail to adequately respond to changes in technology, customer demands and market competition.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid changes in technology innovation and deployment to address evolving customer demands, improve operational efficiency and disrupt competitive dynamics. Our ability to continually improve our technology platform, processes and products in this environment is essential to maintain a competitive position in customer satisfaction, market share and other areas. Due to natural complexity in technology innovation, potentially high costs of certain initiatives, and hiring and retention challenges, we may experience technical or other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development, introduction or marketing of new services or enhanced product offerings. These challenges related to emerging technology may result in loss of competitive differentiation, margin deterioration, departure of key partners, declining market share, inability to achieve growth targets, inefficient or outdated service delivery platforms, loss of customers and brand erosion, declining employee morale, inability to attract or retain key talent and other unfavorable consequences which may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and adversely affected by several factors\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations, and may continue to experience such fluctuations due to many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u25cf\nour ability to execute our business plan;\n\u25cf\noperating results below expectations;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nother external factors, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, legislative developments and car supply market conditions;\n\u25cf our ability to enter into and maintain strategic relationship to grow demand for our services;\n\u25cf\nour issuance of additional securities, including debt or equity or a combination thereof; and\n\u25cf\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may acquire other companies, assets or technologies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, applications and services or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our services, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated.\nIn addition, we do not have any experience in acquiring other businesses. If we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel, operations and technologies successfully, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the acquired business due to a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\ninability to integrate or benefit from acquired technologies or services in a profitable manner;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty integrating the accounting systems, operations and personnel of the acquired business;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties and additional expenses associated with supporting legacy products and hosting infrastructure of the acquired business;\n\u25cf\ndifficulty converting the customers of the acquired business onto our platform and contract terms, including disparities in the revenue, licensing, support or professional services model of the acquired company;\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u25cf\nadverse effects to our existing business relationships with business partners and customers as a result of the acquisition;\n\u25cf\nthe potential loss of key employees;\n\u25cf\nuse of resources that are needed in other parts of our business; and\n\u25cf\nuse of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAcquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our operating results, business and financial position may suffer.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports, or publish unfavorable research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume may decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us, our business, our markets and our competitors. We do not control these analysts. If securities analysts do not cover our common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary about us or our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fails to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the market and interest in our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline and may also impair our ability to expand our business with existing customers and attract new customers.\nFuture sales and issuances of our securities could result in additional dilution of the percentage ownership of our shareholders and could cause our share price to fall.\nWe expect that additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations, including research and development, increased marketing, hiring new personnel, efforts to expand our business, and continuing activities as an operating public company. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our shareholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. Such sales may also result in material dilution to our existing shareholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing shareholders.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our shares of common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our shares.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to shareholders will therefore be limited to the increase, if any, of our share price.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and will be able to avail ourselves of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d we intend to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our initial public offering; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC.\nWe may be at risk of securities class action litigation.\nWe may be at risk of securities class action litigation. For example, during our 2021 fiscal year, a class-action case was filed against the Company and certain of its current or former officers. In the past, technology companies have experienced significant stock price volatility. If we face additional litigation and if a case is not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, it would likely result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business and results in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware could make an acquisition of the company more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management. These provisions include a classified board of directors, a prohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders, and the ability of the board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or the DGCL, which prohibits stockholders owning in excess of 15% of the outstanding combined organization voting stock from merging or combining with the combined organization. Although we believe these provisions collectively will provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove then-current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of management.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of us and may affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur corporate documents and the DGCL contain provisions that may enable our board of directors to resist a change in control of the Company even if a change in control were to be considered favorable by our stockholders. These provisions:\n\u25cf\nstagger the terms of our board of directors and require 66 and 2/3% stockholder voting to remove directors, who may only be removed for cause;\n\u25cf\nauthorize our board of directors to issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock and to determine the rights and preferences of those shares, which may be senior to our common stock, without prior stockholder approval;\n\u25cf\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominating directors and proposing matters to be voted on by stockholders at stockholders\u2019 meetings;\n\u25cf\nprohibit our stockholders from calling a special meeting and prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent;\n\u25cf\nrequire 66 and 2/3% stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws; and\n\u25cf\nprohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates.\nThese provisions could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of us. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take other corporate actions our stockholders desire.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws or any action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case subject to the Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein and the claim not being one which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery or for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. Any person purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of our common stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to this provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This choice of forum provision may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, employees and agents even though an action, if successful, might benefit our stockholders. Stockholders who do bring a claim in the Court of Chancery could face additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claim, particularly if they do not reside in or near Delaware. The Court of Chancery may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments or results may be more favorable to us than to our stockholders. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 17886, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "HYRE"}
