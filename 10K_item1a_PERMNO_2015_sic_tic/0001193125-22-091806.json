{"cik": "798528", "company": "ODYSSEY MARINE EXPLORATION INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-31", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nin evaluating our company and our business. Our business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks. The material risks are described below and should be carefully considered in evaluating Odyssey or any investment decision relating to our securities. This section is intended only as a summary of the principal risks. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results, or financial results could suffer. If this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock.\nOur business involves a high degree of risk.\nAn investment in Odyssey is extremely speculative and of exceptionally high risk. With respect to mineral exploration projects, there are uncertainties with respect to the quality and quantity of the material and their economic feasibility, the price we can obtain for the sale of the deposit or the ore extracted from the deposit, the granting of the necessary permits to operate, environmental safety, technology for extraction and processing, distribution of the eventual ore product, and funding of necessary equipment and facilities. In projects where Odyssey takes a minority ownership position in the company holding the mining rights, there may be uncertainty as to that company\u2019s ability to move the project forward.\nThe research and data we use may not be reliable.\nThe success of a mineral project is dependent to a substantial degree upon the research and data we or the contracting party have obtained. By its very nature, research and data regarding mineral deposits can be imprecise, incomplete, outdated, and unreliable. For mineral exploration, data is collected based on a sampling technique and available data may not be representative of the entire ore body or tenement area. Prior to conducting off-shore\nexploration, we typically conduct on-shore\nresearch. There is no guarantee that the models and research conducted onshore will be representative of actual results on the seafloor. Offshore exploration typically requires significant expenditures, with no guarantee that the results will be useful or financially rewarding.\nOperations may be affected by natural hazards.\nUnderwater exploration and recovery operations are inherently difficult and dangerous and may be delayed or suspended by weather, sea conditions or other natural hazards. Further, such operations may be undertaken more safely during certain months of the year than others. We cannot guarantee that we, or the entities we are affiliated with, will be able to conduct exploration, sampling or extractions operations during favorable periods. In addition, even though sea conditions in a particular search location may be somewhat predictable, the possibility exists that unexpected conditions may occur that adversely affect our operations. It is also possible that natural hazards may prevent or significantly delay operations. Seabed mineral extraction work may be subject to interruptions resulting from storms that adversely affect the extraction operations or the ports of delivery. Project planning considers these risks.\nWe may be unable to establish our rights to resources or items we discover or recover.\nWe may discover potentially valuable seabed mineral deposits, but we may be unable to get title to the deposits or get the necessary governmental permits to commercially extract the minerals. Mineral deposits may be in controlled waters where the policies and laws of a certain government may change abruptly, thereby adversely affecting our ability to operate in those zones. We have a process for evaluating this risk in our proprietary Global Prospectivity Program.\nThe market for any objects or minerals we recover is uncertain.\nDuring the time between when a mineral deposit is discovered and the first extracted minerals are sold, world and local prices for the mineral may fluctuate drastically and thereby adversely affect the economics of the mineral project.\nWe could experience delays in the disposition or sale of minerals or recovered objects.\nIt may take significant time between when a mineral deposit is discovered and the first extracted minerals are sold. Stakes in the mineral deposits can potentially be sold at an earlier date, but there is no guarantee that there will be readily available buyers at favorable competitive prices.\nLegal, political or civil issues could interfere with our marine operations.\nLegal, political or civil issues of governments throughout the world could restrict access to our operational marine sites or interfere with our marine operations or rights to seabed mineral deposits. In many countries, the legislation covering ocean exploration lacks clarity or certainty. As a result, when we are conducting projects in certain areas of the world for our own account or on our behalf of a contracting party, we may be subjected to unexpected delays, requests, and outcomes as we work with local governments to define and obtain the necessary permits and to assert our claims over assets on the seafloor bottom. Our vessel, equipment, personnel and or cargo could be seized or detained by government authorities. We may have to work with different units of a government, and there may be a change of government representatives over time. This may result in unexpected changes or interpretations in government contracts and legislation.\nWe may be unable to get permission to conduct exploration, excavation, or extraction operations.\nIt is possible we will not be successful in obtaining the necessary permits to conduct exploration or excavation and extraction operations. In addition, permits we obtain may be revoked or not honored by the entities that issued them. In addition, certain governments may develop new permit requirements that could delay new operations or interrupt existing operations.\nChanges in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses.\nAs changes in our business environment occur, we may need to adjust our business strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise find it necessary to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. When these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets or sell certain assets. In any of these events our costs may increase, and we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets. Discontinuing the use of a multi-year charter of a ship may result in large one-time\ncosts to cover any penalties or charges to put the ship back into its original condition.\nWe may be unsuccessful in raising the necessary capital to fund operations and capital expenditures.\nOur ability to generate cash inflows is dependent upon our ability to provide mineral exploration and development services to our subsidiaries and other subsea mineral companies or monetize mineral rights. However, we cannot guarantee that the sales and other cash sources will generate sufficient cash inflows to meet our overall cash requirements. If cash inflows are not sufficient to meet our business requirements, we will be required to raise additional capital through other financing activities. While we have been successful in raising the necessary funds in the past, there can be no assurance we can continue to do so in the future.\nWe depend on key employees and face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees.\nOur employees are vital to our success, and our key management and other employees are difficult to replace. We currently do not have employment contracts with the majority of our key employees. We may not be able to retain highly qualified employees in the future which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may continue to experience significant losses from operations.\nWe have experienced a net loss in every fiscal year since our inception except for 2004. Our net losses were $10.0 million in 2021, $14.8 million in 2020 and $10.4 million in 2019. Even if we do generate operating income in one or more quarters in the future, subsequent developments in our industry, customer base, business or cost structure or an event such as significant litigation or a significant transaction may cause us to again experience operating losses. We may not become profitable for the long-term, or even for any quarter.\nTechnological obsolescence of our marine assets or failure of critical equipment could put a strain on our capital requirements or operational capabilities.\nWe employ state-of-the-art\ntechnology including side-scan sonar, magnetometers, ROVs, and other advanced science and technology to perform seabed mineral exploration and to locate and recover shipwrecks at depths previously unreachable in an economically feasible manner. Although we try to maintain back-ups\non critical equipment and components, equipment failures may require us to delay or suspend operations. Also, while we endeavor to keep marine equipment in excellent working condition and current with all available upgrades, technological advances in new equipment may provide superior efficiencies compared to the capabilities of our existing equipment, and this could require us to purchase new equipment which would require additional capital.\nWe may not be able to contract with clients or customers for marine services or syndicated projects.\nIn the past, from time to time, we have earned revenue by chartering out vessels, equipment and crew and providing marine services to clients or customers. Even if we do contract out our services, the revenue may not be sufficient to cover administrative overhead costs. While the operational results of these syndicated projects are generally successful, the clients or customers may not be willing or financially able to continue with syndicated projects of this type in the future. Failure to secure such revenue producing contracts in the future may have a material adverse impact on our revenue and operating cash flows. We may take payment for these services in the form of cash, equity in the client\u2019s company, or a financial interest in the tenement areas.\nThe issuance of shares at conversion prices lower than the market price at the time of conversion and the sale of such shares could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nSome of our outstanding shares may have been acquired from time to time upon conversion of convertible notes at conversion prices that are lower than the market price of our common stock at the time of conversion. In the past, Odyssey has issued debt obligations that could be converted into common shares at prices below the current market price. Conversion of the notes at conversion prices that are lower than the market price at the time of conversion and the sale of the shares issued upon conversion could have an adverse effect upon the market price of our common stock.\nInvestments in subsea mineral exploration companies may prove unsuccessful.\nWe have invested in marine mineral companies that to date are still in the exploration phase and have not begun to earn revenue from operations. We may or may not have control or input on the future development of these businesses. There can be no assurance that these companies will achieve profitability or otherwise be successful in capitalizing on the mineralized materials they intend to exploit.\nWe may be subject to short selling strategies\n.\nShort sellers of our stock may be manipulative and may attempt to drive down the market price of our common stock. Short selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own but rather has, supposedly, borrowed from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities back at a later date to return to the lender. The short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. As it is therefore in the short seller\u2019s best interests for the price of the stock to decline, many short sellers (sometime known as \u201cdisclosed shorts\u201d) publish, or arrange for the publication of, negative opinions regarding the relevant issuer and its business prospects to create negative market momentum and generate profits for themselves after selling a stock short. Although traditionally these disclosed shorts were limited in their ability to access mainstream business media or to otherwise create negative market rumors, the rise of the Internet and technological advancements regarding document creation, videotaping and publication by weblog (\u201cblogging\u201d) have allowed many disclosed shorts to publicly attack a company\u2019s credibility, strategy and veracity by means of so-called\n\u201cresearch reports\u201d that mimic the type of investment analysis performed by large Wall Street firms and independent research analysts. These short attacks have, in the past, led to selling of shares in the market, on occasion in large scale and broad base. Issuers who have limited trading volumes and are susceptible to higher volatility levels than large-cap\nstocks, can be particularly vulnerable to such short seller attacks. These short seller publications are not regulated by any governmental, self-regulatory organization or other official authority in the U.S., are not subject to certification requirements imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission and, accordingly, the opinions they express may be based on distortions or omissions of actual facts or, in some cases, fabrications of facts. In light of the limited risks involved in publishing such information, and the enormous profit that can be made from running just one successful short attack, unless the short sellers become subject to significant penalties, it is more likely than not that disclosed short sellers will continue to issue such reports.\nSome of our equipment or assets could be seized or we may be forced to sell certain assets.\nWe have pledged certain assets, such as equipment and shares of subsidiaries, as collateral under our loan agreements. Some suppliers have the ability to seize some of our assets if we do not make timely payments for the services, supplies, or equipment that they have provided to us. If we were unable to make payments on these obligations, the lender or supplier may seize the asset or force the sale of the asset. The loss of such assets could adversely affect our operations. The sale of the asset may be done in a manner and under circumstances that do not provide the highest cash value for the sale of the asset.\nWe could be delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market.\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, which imposes, among other requirements, a minimum bid requirement. The closing bid price for our common stock must remain at or above $1.00 per share to comply with NASDAQ\u2019s minimum bid requirement for continued listing. If the closing bid price for our common stock is less than $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, NASDAQ may send us a notice stating we will be provided a period of 180 days to regain compliance with the minimum bid requirement or else NASDAQ may make a determination to delist our common stock. Another requirement for continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market is to maintain our market capitalization above $35.0 million.\nOur failure to maintain compliance with the above-mentioned and other NASDAQ continued listing requirements may lead to the delisting of our common from the NASDAQ Capital Market. Delisting from the NASDAQ Capital Market could make trading our common stock more difficult for investors, potentially leading to declines in our share price and liquidity. If our common stock is delisted by NASDAQ, our common stock may be eligible to trade on an over-the-counter\nquotation system, where an investor may find it more difficult to sell our stock or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock. We cannot assure you that our common stock, if delisted from the NASDAQ Capital Market, will be listed on another national securities exchange or quoted on an over-the\ncounter quotation system.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all of our business risks\n.\nAlthough we seek to obtain insurance for some of our main operational risks, there is no guarantee that the insurance policies that we have are sufficient, that they will be in place when needed, that we will be able to obtain insurance coverage\nwhen desired, that insurance will be available on commercially attractive terms, or that we will be able to anticipate the risks that need to be insured. For example, although we may be able to obtain War Risk coverage for a project at a specific date and location, such insurance may be unavailable at other times and locations. Although we may be able to insure our marine assets for certain risks such as certain possible loss or damage scenarios, we may lack insurance to cover against government seizure or detention of our certain marine assets. Permanent loss or temporary loss of our marine assets and the associated business interruption without commensurate compensation from an insurance policy could severely impact the financial results and operational capabilities of the company.\nWe may be exposed to cyber security risks.\nWe depend on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and among ourselves within our company. Additionally, one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of our employees. Our information systems, and those of our service and support providers, are vulnerable to an increasing threat of continually evolving cybersecurity risks. Computer viruses, hackers and other external hazards, as well as improper or inadvertent staff behavior could expose confidential company and personal data systems and information to security breaches. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or cause system interruption change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these incidents or techniques, timely discover them, or implement adequate preventative measures. With respect to our commercial arrangements with service and support providers, we have processes designed to require third-party IT outsourcing, offsite storage and other vendors to agree to maintain certain standards with respect to the storage, protection and transfer of confidential, personal and proprietary information. However, we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional non-compliance\nby a vendor\u2019s employee or agent, the breakdown of a vendor\u2019s data protection processes, or a cyber-attack on a vendor\u2019s information systems or our information systems.\nMining exploration, development and operating have inherent risks.\nMining operations generally involve a high degree of risk. The financing, exploration, development and mining of any of our properties is furthermore subject to a number of macroeconomic, legal and social factors, including commodity prices, laws and regulations, political conditions, currency fluctuations, the ability to hire and retain qualified people, the inability to obtain suitable and adequate machinery, equipment or labor and obtaining necessary services in the jurisdictions in which we may operate. Unfavorable changes to these and other factors have the potential to negatively affect our operations and business. Major expenses may be required to locate and establish mineral reserves and resources, to develop processes and to construct mining and processing facilities at a particular site. Mining, processing, development and exploration activities depend, to one degree or another, on adequate infrastructure. Unusual or infrequent weather phenomena, sabotage, government or other interference could adversely affect our operations, financial condition and results of operations. It is impossible to ensure that the exploration or development programs planned by us will result in a profitable commercial mining operation. Whether precious or base metal or mineral deposit will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors, some of which are: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as the quantity and quality of mineralization ; mineral prices, which are highly cyclical; and government regulations, including regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting minerals and environmental protection. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination of these factors may result in not receiving an adequate return on invested capital. There is no certainty that the expenditures to be made by us towards the exploration and evaluation of our projects will result in discoveries or production of commercial quantities of the minerals. In addition, once in production, mineral reserves are finite and there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate additional reserves as its existing reserves are depleted.\nWe are subject to significant governmental regulations, which affect our operations and costs of conducting our business.\nOur exploration operations are subject to government legislation, policies and controls relating to prospecting, development, production, environmental protection, mining taxes and labor standards. In order for us to carry out our activities, various licenses and permits must be obtained and kept current. There is no guarantee that the Company\u2019s licenses and permits will be granted, or that once granted will be maintained and extended. In addition, the terms and conditions of such licenses or permits could be changed and there can be no assurances that any application to renew any existing licenses will be approved. There can be no assurance that all permits that we require will be obtainable on reasonable terms, or at all. Delays or a failure to obtain such permits, or a failure to comply with the terms of any such permits that we have obtained, could have a material adverse impact on our operations. We may be required to contribute to the cost of providing the required infrastructure to facilitate the development of our properties and will also have to obtain and comply with permits and licenses that may contain\nspecific conditions concerning operating procedures, water use, waste disposal, spills, environmental studies and financial assurances. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with any such conditions and non-compliance\nwith such conditions may result in the loss of certain of our permits and licenses on properties, which may have a material adverse effect on us. Future taxation of mining operators cannot be predicted with certainty so planning must be undertaken using present conditions and best estimates of any potential future changes. There is no certainty that such planning will be effective to mitigate adverse consequences of future taxation on us.\nWe may not be able to obtain all required permits and licenses to place any of our properties into production.\nOur current and future operations, including development activities and commencement of production, if warranted, require permits from governmental authorities and such operations are and will be governed by laws and regulations governing prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, toxic substances, environmental protection, mine safety and other matters. Companies engaged in mineral property exploration and the development or operation of mines and related facilities generally experience increased costs, and delays in production and other schedules as a result of the need to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permits. We cannot predict if all permits which we may require for continued exploration, development or construction of mining facilities and conduct of mining operations will be obtainable on reasonable terms, if at all. Costs related to applying for and obtaining permits and licenses may be prohibitive and could delay our planned exploration and development activities. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and permitting requirements may result in enforcement actions, including orders issued by regulatory or judicial authorities causing operations to cease or be curtailed, and may include corrective measures requiring capital expenditures, installation of additional equipment, or remedial actions. Parties engaged in mining operations may be required to compensate those suffering loss or damage by reason of the mining activities and may have civil or criminal fines or penalties imposed for violations of applicable laws or regulations. Amendments to current laws, regulations and permits governing operations and activities of mining companies, or more stringent implementation thereof, could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cause increases in capital expenditures or production costs or reduction in levels of production at producing properties or require abandonment or delays in development of new mining properties\nCalculations of mineral resources and mineral reserves are estimates only and subject to uncertainty.\nThe estimating of mineral resources and mineral reserves is an imprecise process and the accuracy of such estimates is a function of the quantity and quality of available data, the assumptions used and judgments made in interpreting engineering and geological information and estimating future capital and operating costs. There is significant uncertainty in any reserve or resource estimate, and the economic results of mining a mineral deposit may differ materially from the estimates as additional data are developed or interpretations change.\nEstimated mineral resources and mineral reserves may be materially affected by other factors.\nIn addition to uncertainties inherent in estimating mineral resources and mineral reserves, other factors may adversely affect estimated mineral resources and mineral reserves. Such factors may include but are not limited to metallurgical, environmental, permitting, legal, title, taxation, socio-economic, marketing, political, gold prices, and capital and operating costs. Any of these or other adverse factors may reduce or eliminate estimated mineral reserves and mineral resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and corporate reputation.", "PERMNO": 89898, "SIC": 4400, "TIC": "OMEX"}
