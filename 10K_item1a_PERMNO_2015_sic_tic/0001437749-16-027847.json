{"cik": "1061069", "company": "AVALON HOLDINGS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThe following factors, as well as, factors described elsewhere in the Form 10-K, or in other filings by Avalon with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could adversely affect Avalon\u2019s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Other factors not presently known to us or that we presently believe are not material could also affect our business operations and financial results.\nVoting Control by Management\nAvalon has two classes of common stock, Class A and Class B. Each share of Class A Common Stock is entitled to one vote and each share of Class B Common Stock is entitled to ten votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders. Except for the election of Avalon\u2019s Board of Directors, the Class A Common Stock and the Class B Common Stock vote together as a single class on all matters presented for a vote to the shareholders. The holders of the Avalon Class B Common Stock, which consists principally of the management of Avalon, have approximately 66 percent of the aggregate voting power of the outstanding Avalon Common Stock. Thus, the holders of the Avalon Class A Common Stock will not, either alone or acting collectively, be able to elect a majority of the members of Avalon\u2019s Board of Directors (the \u201cAvalon Board\u201d) or control many corporate actions. However, the holders of the Avalon Class A Common Stock, voting as a separate class, have the right to elect the number of directors equal to at least 25 percent of the total Board of Directors of Avalon until the outstanding Avalon Class B Common Stock constitutes less than 50 percent of the total voting power of the outstanding Avalon Common Stock, after which time the holders of the Avalon Class A and Class B Common Stock will vote as a single class for the election of directors and all matters presented for a vote to the shareholders. The holders of a majority of all outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock, voting as separate classes, must also approve amendments to the Articles of Incorporation that adversely affect the shares of their class.\nEach share of Class B Common Stock is convertible, at any time, at the option of the shareholder, into one share of Class A Common Stock. Shares of Class B Common Stock are also automatically converted into shares of Class A Common Stock on the transfer of such shares to any person other than Avalon, another holder of Class B Common Stock or a Permitted Transferee, as defined in Avalon\u2019s Articles of Incorporation.\nCertain Anti-Takeover Provisions of Articles of Incorporation, Code of Regulations and Ohio Law\nThe Articles of Incorporation and Code of Regulations of Avalon, as well as, Ohio statutory law, contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging an acquisition of control of Avalon not approved by the Avalon Board. Such provisions may also have the effect of discouraging third parties from making proposals involving an acquisition or change of control of Avalon, even though such proposals, if made, might be considered desirable by a majority of the Avalon stockholders. Such provisions could also have the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to cause the replacement of the current management of Avalon without the concurrence of the Avalon Board. These provisions have been designed to enable Avalon to develop its business and foster its long-term growth without disruptions caused by the threat of a takeover not deemed by the Avalon Board to be in the best interest of Avalon and its stockholders.\nDividend Policy\nThe dividend policy of Avalon is determined by the Avalon Board. Avalon presently intends to retain earnings for use in the operation and expansion of its business and, therefore, does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nAvalon\u2019s market for shares may be subject to greater volatility and limited daily activity\nMarket fluctuations, as well as economic conditions, may adversely affect the market price of the Avalon Class A Common Stock. Given the relatively small market capitalization of Avalon, the market for its Class A Common Stock may be subject to greater volatility than would be the case for a large company. In addition, the selling and buying of shares on a daily basis may be limited because of the relatively small capitalization of Avalon.\nA majority of Avalon\u2019s business is not subject to long-term contracts\nA significant portion of Avalon\u2019s business is generated from waste brokerage and management services provided to customers and is not subject to long-term contracts. In light of current economic, regulatory and competitive conditions, there can be no assurance that Avalon\u2019s current customers will continue to transact business with Avalon at historical levels. Failure by Avalon to retain its current customers or to replace lost business could adversely impact the future financial performance of Avalon.\nAvalon\u2019s captive landfill management business is dependent upon a single customer as its sole source of revenue. If the captive landfill management business is unable to retain this customer, Avalon\u2019s future financial performance could be adversely impacted.\nThe golf operations primary source of revenues is derived from the members of the Avalon Golf and Country Club. Members are obligated to pay dues for a one year period. As such, the golf operations are primarily dependent on the sale and renewal of memberships in the Avalon Golf and Country Club, on a year to year basis.\nLong-lived asset impairment\nCertain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets should be assessed. Such events or changes may include a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, or a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or projected future losses. If an event occurs or changes in circumstances are present, Avalon estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the applicable groups of long-lived assets and their eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying value, Avalon would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying value of the groups of long-lived assets exceeds their fair value. Avalon would determine the fair value by using quoted market prices, if available, for such assets; or if quoted market prices are not available, Avalon would discount the expected estimated future cash flows.\nThe ability to accurately predict future cash flows may impact the determination of fair value. Avalon\u2019s assessments of cash flows represent management\u2019s best estimate at the time of the impairment review. Avalon estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use and, if applicable, the eventual disposition of the assets. The key variables that management must estimate include, among other factors, sales, costs, inflation and capital spending. Significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables, and they include inherent uncertainties. If different cash flows had been estimated in the current period, the value of the long-lived assets could have been materially impacted. Furthermore, Avalon\u2019s accounting estimates may change from period to period as conditions in markets change, and this could materially impact financial results in future periods.\nSeasonality\nAvalon\u2019s operations are somewhat seasonal in nature since a significant portion of those operations are primarily conducted in selected northeastern and midwestern states. Additionally, Avalon\u2019s golf courses are located in northeast Ohio and western Pennsylvania and are significantly dependent upon weather conditions during the golf season. As a result, Avalon\u2019s financial performance could be adversely affected by adverse weather conditions.\nSaltwater Disposal Wells\nSaltwater disposal wells are regulated by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources (\u201cODNR\u201d), with portions of the disposal facilities regulated by the Ohio EPA. As exploitation of the Marcellus and Utica shale formations by the hydrofracturing process develops, regulatory and public awareness of the environmental risks of saltwater brine and its disposal in saltwater disposal wells is growing and consequently, it is expected that regulation governing the construction and operation of saltwater disposal wells will increase in scope and complexity. Increased regulation may result in increased construction and/or operating costs, which could adversely affect the financial results of Avalon.\nThere is a continuing risk during the saltwater disposal well\u2019s operation of an environmental event causing contamination to the water tables in the surrounding area, or seismic events. The occurrence of a spill or contamination at a disposal well site could result in remedial expenses and/or result in the operations at the well site being suspended and/or terminated by the Ohio EPA or the ODNR. Incurring remedial expenses and /or a suspension or termination of Avalon\u2019s right to operate one or more saltwater disposal wells at the well site could have an adverse effect on Avalon\u2019s financial results.\nAs a result of a seismic event with a magnitude of 2.1 occurring on August 31, 2014, the Chief of the Division of Oil and Gas Resources Management (\u201cChief\u201d or \u201cDivision\u201d) issued Orders on September 3, 2014, to immediately suspend all operations of both of Avalon\u2019s saltwater injection wells. The Orders were based on the findings that the two saltwater injection wells were located in close proximity to the area of known seismic activity and also that the saltwater injection wells pose a risk of increasing or creating seismic activity. The two saltwater injection wells are located approximately 112 feet apart. Based on these findings, the Chief ordered the immediate suspension of all operations of the two saltwater injection wells, until the Division could further evaluate the wells.\nOn September 5, 2014, Avalon submitted the information required by the Chief\u2019s Order in regards to its AWMS #1 injection well. The Division reviewed all the information submitted by Avalon and additional data. Based upon this review, the Division concluded that with reasonable scientific certainty, the injection operations of AWMS #1 were not related to the deep seismic event that occurred on August 31, 2014. As a result, the Order suspending all operations of AWMS #1 was terminated effective September 18, 2014. As such, Avalon resumed injection operations of AWMS #1 consistent with all terms and conditions of the permit issued on July 18, 2013.\nOn September 19, 2014, Avalon submitted the information and a written plan required by the Chief\u2019s Order proposing the establishment of certain operations and management controls on injections at the AWMS #2 injection well. The plan called for injection to resume at AWMS #2 at lower levels and monitored for seismicity. Under the plan, Avalon would gradually increase injection volumes over time based upon data obtained through monitoring.\nOn October 2, 2014, Avalon filed an appeal with the Ohio Oil and Gas Commission disputing the basis for suspending operations of AWMS #2 and also the authority of the Chief to immediately suspend such operations. On November 19, 2014, Avalon filed a Motion to Stay the execution of the suspension order.\nOn March 11, 2015, an appeal hearing was held and post hearing briefs were filed. The Chief stated during the hearing that the suspension is only temporary, and that he expects that AWMS #2 will be allowed to inject once the state\u2019s final policymaking is complete.\nOn August 12, 2015, the Oil and Gas Commission upheld the temporary suspension of injection operations of AWMS #2 stating that the temporary suspension will allow the Chief to more fully evaluate the facts in anticipation of the Division\u2019s implementation of a comprehensive regulatory plan that will specifically address injection-induced seismicity. In October 2015, the Division informed the Company that they were currently drafting the hydraulic fracturing induced seismicity policy and will start the Class II injection well policy once complete.\nOn September 8, 2015, Avalon filed an appeal with the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. Avalon also filed a notice of appeal addressed to the Division. On October 16, 2015, the Division filed a motion to dismiss stating that although Avalon filed its notice of appeal with the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, it did not file the notice of appeal with the Oil and Gas Commission as mandated by the Ohio Revised Code. On October 20, 2015, Avalon filed its notice of appeal with the Oil and Gas Commission. On December 18, 2015, the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas concluded that Avalon untimely filed its notice of appeal with the Oil and Gas Commission and thus did not comply with the Ohio Revised Code and that the Division\u2019s motion to dismiss was granted. On January 4, 2016, Avalon filed an appeal with the Franklin County, Ohio 10th District Court of Appeals regarding the motion to dismiss ruling on the September 8, 2015 appeal. An appeal hearing is tentatively scheduled to occur in April of 2016.\nAvalon was not in violation of any law, Ohio Regulation governing its operations or any of the terms and conditions of its injection permit, as acknowledged by the Division. The observed seismic events the Division used to justify the suspension order were of such magnitudes that occur every day in the State of Ohio. There were no documented complaints from the public concerning the observed seismic events. Avalon does not believe that there is substantial risk that the operations of AWMS #2 present an imminent danger to public health, safety or damage to the environment. The argument is further evidenced by the publication \u201cPotential Injection-Induced Seismicity Associated with Oil & Gas Development: The Primer on Technical and Regulatory Considerations Informing Risk Management and Mitigation\u201d released in 2015 stating that seismic events below 3.0 (approximately 22 times stronger than the August 31, 2014 event) are generally not felt by humans. This report was developed by the StatesFirst Induced Seismicity by Injection Work Group (\u201cISWG\u201d) members (the State agencies) with input from the ISWG technical advisors (subject matter experts from academia, industry, federal agencies, and environmental organizations) to help better inform the public on technical and regulatory considerations associated with evaluation and response, seismic monitoring systems, information sharing, and the use of ground motion metrics. In addition, the Company also contends that other Class II injection wells within the geographical area have produced seismic events with similar and/or higher magnitudes and have been allowed to continue operations. Operations of AWMS #2 will remain temporarily suspended under the Chief\u2019s order. In conjunction with the August 12, 2015 decision, Avalon temporarily suspended operations of AWMS #1 and will resume operations when a favorable ruling on AWMS #2 is received.\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nAvalon may be subject to liability for environmental contamination caused by pollutants, the transportation, treatment or disposal of which was arranged for by Avalon or one of its predecessors.\nAlthough Avalon has compliance guidelines for its waste brokerage and management services business, Avalon could still incur a substantial liability for environmental damage not covered by or in excess of its insurance policy limits and, as such, its financial condition could be adversely affected.\nCompetitive pressures\nThe hazardous and nonhazardous waste disposal brokerage and management business is highly competitive and fragmented. Avalon\u2019s waste disposal brokerage and management business competes with other brokerage companies, as well as, with companies which own treatment and disposal facilities. In addition to price, knowledge and service are key factors when competing for waste disposal brokerage and management business. Avalon\u2019s waste disposal brokerage and management business obtains and retains customers by providing services and identifying cost-efficient disposal options unique to a customer\u2019s needs. Consolidation within the solid waste industry has resulted in reducing the number of companies offering disposal options available to waste generators and may cause disposal pricing to increase. Avalon may need to absorb all or a portion of these cost increases depending upon competitive conditions at the time.\nGolf Memberships and Liquor Licenses\nThe Avalon Golf and Country Club operates golf courses and related clubhouses at each of its three facilities. The Avalon Golf and Country Club facilities also offer swimming pools, fitness centers, tennis courts, dining and banquet facilities and spa services. In addition, The Avalon Inn provides guests with a self-contained vacation experience, offering hotel guests golf packages to all of the golf courses of the Avalon Golf and Country Club and allows its guests to utilize the facilities at each of the clubhouses. Members of the Avalon Golf and Country Club also have access to all of the amenities offered by The Avalon Inn. The Avalon Golf and Country Club competes with many public courses and country clubs in the area. Although the golf courses continue to be available to the general public, the primary source of revenues is derived from the members of the Avalon Golf and Country Club. Avalon believes that the combination of its three golf facilities and the addition of The Avalon Inn will result in additional memberships in the Avalon Golf and Country Club. The ability to retain current members and attract new members has been an ongoing challenge. Although Avalon was able to increase the number of members of the Avalon Golf and Country Club, as of December 31, 2015, Avalon has not attained its membership goals. There can be no assurance as to when such goals will be attained and when the golf and related operations will ultimately become profitable. Avalon is continually using different marketing strategies to attract new members, such as local television advertising and various membership promotions. A significant decline in members could adversely affect the future financial performance of Avalon.\nAll three of Avalon\u2019s golf course operations and The Avalon Inn currently hold liquor licenses for their respective facilities. If, for some reason, any one of these facilities were to lose their liquor license, the financial performance of the golf and related operations would be adversely affected.\nGovernment regulations\nThe federal government and numerous state and local governmental bodies are continuing to consider legislation or regulations to either restrict or impede the disposal and/or transportation of waste. A portion of Avalon\u2019s waste management services revenues is derived from the brokerage of the disposal and/or transportation of out-of-state waste. Any law or regulation restricting or impeding the transportation of waste or the acceptance of out-of-state waste for disposal could have a negative effect on Avalon. Avalon\u2019s waste brokerage and management services may also be affected by the trend toward laws requiring the development of waste reduction and recycling or other programs.\nChanges in laws, regulations and accounting standards\nOur implementation of new accounting rules and interpretations or compliance with changes in existing accounting rules could adversely affect our balance sheet or results of operations or cause unanticipated fluctuations in our results of operations in future periods.\nAccounting estimates and judgments\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and subsequent adjustments could have a material adverse effect on operating results for the period or periods in which the change is identified.\nInflation\nAvalon has not entered into any long-term fixed price contracts that could have a material adverse impact upon its financial performance in periods of inflation. In general, management believes that rising costs resulting from price inflation could be passed on to customers; however, Avalon may need to absorb all or a portion of these cost increases depending upon competitive conditions at the time.", "PERMNO": 86113, "SIC": 4955, "TIC": "AWX"}
