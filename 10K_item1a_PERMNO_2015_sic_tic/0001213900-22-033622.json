Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our securities is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following factors and other information in this Annual Report and our other SEC filings before making a decision to invest in our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial conditions and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock and warrants may decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nSummary of Risks Affecting our Company\nOur business is subject to numerous risks described in the section titled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d below. A summary of the material risk factors affecting our business is set forth below.\n\u25cf The Company may be unable to successfully execute its growth strategy including the consummation of the merger with Tingo.\n\u25cf MICT\u2019s ability to be successful will be dependent upon the efforts of the MICT Board and key personnel and the loss of such persons could negatively impact the operations and profitability of MICT\u2019s post-combination business.\n\u25cf We may need a significant amount of additional capital, which could substantially dilute your investment.\n\u25cf If MICT fails to meet all applicable Nasdaq requirements, Nasdaq may delist its Common Stock, which could have an adverse impact on its liquidity and market price.\n\u25cf MICT\u2019s stockholders may not benefit from the Company\u2019s transaction with Tingo commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the transaction.\n\u25cf The COVID-19 pandemic, or any other pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, may materially and adversely affect MICT\u2019s business and operations. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic, or any other pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, may materially and adversely affect Intermediate\u2019s and Micronet\u2019s business and thereby have a material adverse effect on MICT\u2019s investment in Intermediate and Micronet.\n\u25cf Because almost all of MICT\u2019s officers and directors are located in non-U.S. jurisdictions, you may have no effective recourse against management for misconduct.\n\u25cf MICT anticipates that its operating costs and expenses will increase.\n\u25cf The Company\u2019s platform and internal systems rely on software and technological infrastructure that is highly technical, and if they contain undetected errors, its business could be adversely affected.\n\u25cf Changes in China\u2019s economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\n\u25cf The complexities, uncertainties and rapid changes in PRC regulation of the Internet-related businesses and companies require significant resources for compliance and the uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit the legal protections available to us.\n\u25cf The 2006 M&A Rules established complex procedures for some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors, which could make it difficult to pursue growth through acquisitions in China.\n\u25cf Fluctuations in exchange rates of the RMB could materially affect financial results. Furthermore, MICT\u2019s financial results may be negatively affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\n\u25cf Under the enterprise income tax (\u201cEIT\u201d) Law, we may be classified as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d of China. Such classification would likely result in unfavorable tax consequences.\n\u25cf Potential political, economic and military instability in Israel could adversely affect operations.\n\u25cf We have issued and may issue additional preferred stock in the future, and the terms of the preferred stock may reduce the value of our Common Stock.\n\u25cf The Company\u2019s trading platform has no operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate the Company\u2019s future prospects.\n\u25cf Micronet operates in a highly competitive and fragmented market and may not be able to maintain a competitive position in the future. Any such failure to successfully compete could have a material adverse effect on the value of MICT\u2019s equity interest in Micronet.\nRisk Factors Related to the Integration of Intermediate and Ownership of MICT\u2019s Securities\nMICT may be unable to successfully execute its growth strategy Including merger.\nOne of the Company\u2019s strategies is to pursue organic growth by increasing product offerings and expanding into new verticals and new markets such as China. MICT may not be able to successfully execute all or any of these initiatives, and the results may vary from the expectations of the combined entity or others. Further, even if these initiatives are successful, MICT may not be able to expand and upgrade its technology systems and infrastructure to accommodate increases in the business activity in a timely manner, which could lead to operational breakdowns and delays, loss of customers, a reduction in the growth of its customer base, increased operating expenses, financial losses, increased litigation or customer claims, regulatory sanctions or increased regulatory scrutiny. In addition, Intermediate will need to continue to attract, hire and retain highly skilled and motivated executives and employees to both execute the growth strategy and to manage the resulting growth effectively.\nThe Tingo announced merger may not be able to be completed due to situations and circumstances that may change from time to time. And the conditions for closing any mergers and acquisitions may not be satisfied. Cross-border merger and acquisition transactions may also be subject to additional rules and regulations and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities more time-consuming and complex. Our ability to expand our business through future mergers and acquisitions would as such be materially and adversely affected.\nMICT may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on its financial condition and its share price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nMICT cannot assure you that the due diligence it conducted on Intermediate has revealed all material issues that may be present with regard to such companies, or that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence or that risks outside of MICT\u2019s control will not later arise. Each of MICT and Intermediate therefore has made its decision to complete the Merger on the basis of limited information, and the business combination may not be as profitable as expected, if at all. As a result of these factors, MICT may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in reporting losses. Even if MICT\u2019s due diligence successfully identified certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with MICT\u2019s preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and would not have an immediate impact on MICT\u2019s liquidity, the fact that MICT reports charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about MICT or MICT\u2019s securities. Accordingly, MICT cannot predict the impact that the consummation of the Merger will have on MICT\u2019s securities.\nMICT\u2019s ability to be successful will be dependent upon the efforts of the MICT Board and key personnel and the loss of such persons could negatively impact the operations and profitability of MICT\u2019s post-combination business.\nMICT\u2019s ability to be successful will be dependent upon the efforts of the MICT Board and key personnel. Furthermore, the business of MICT following the Merger is made up in part of Intermediate\u2019s business, and is entirely different from MICT\u2019s historical business. Individuals associated with Intermediate may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a U.S. public company, which could cause MICT\u2019s management to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements.\nMICT is dependent on the services of its executive officers, whose potential conflicts of interest may not permit MICT to effectively execute its business strategy.\nMICT is currently dependent on the continued services and performance of its executive officers, particularly Darren Mercer, MICT\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and a director of the MICT Board. Darren Mercer, is also the Chief Executive Officer of GFH which may result in a potential conflict of interest in Mr. Mercer carrying out his duties as a member of the MICT Board.\nProvisions in MICT\u2019s certificate of incorporation and under Delaware law could make a future acquisition of MICT, which may be beneficial to stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by MICT stockholders to replace or remove the current management.\nProvisions in MICT\u2019s certificate of incorporation, as amended, and MICT\u2019s amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for MICT\u2019s common stock. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for MICT securities, thereby depressing the market price of MICT\u2019s securities. In addition, these provisions may frustrate, deter or prevent any attempts by MICT stockholders to replace or remove current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the MICT Board. Because the MICT Board is responsible for appointing the members of the MICT management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by stockholders to replace current members of the MICT management team.\nMoreover, because MICT is incorporated in Delaware, it is governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the DGCL, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with MICT for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. MICT has not opted out of the restrictions under Section 203.\nWe may need a significant amount of additional capital, which could substantially dilute your investment\nWe may need significant additional capital in the future to continue our planned operations. No assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain such funds upon favorable terms and conditions, if at all. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell Common Stock, convertible securities, or other equity securities in one or more transactions that may include voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as to dividends and liquidation, and conversion and redemption rights, subject to applicable law, and at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time.\nSuch issuances and the exercise of any convertible securities will dilute the percentage ownership of our stockholders and may affect the value of our capital stock and could adversely affect the rights of the holders of such stock, thereby reducing the value of such stock. Moreover, any exercise of convertible securities may adversely affect the terms upon which we will be able to obtain additional equity capital, since the holders of such convertible securities can be expected to exercise them at a time when we would, in all likelihood, be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable to us than those provided in such convertible securities.\nIf we sell shares or other equity securities in one or more other transactions, or issue stock or stock options pursuant to any future employee equity incentive plan, investors may be materially diluted by such subsequent issuances.\nIf the price of our Common Stock is volatile, purchasers of our securities could incur substantial losses.\nThe price of MICT\u2019s Common Stock has been and may continue to be volatile. The market price of MICT\u2019s Common Stock may be influenced by many factors, including but not limited to the following:\n\u25cf developments regarding the Merger and the transactions;\n\u25cf announcements of developments related to MICT\u2019s business (including those aspects of MICT\u2019s business received in connection with the Merger);\n\u25cf quarterly fluctuations in actual or anticipated operating results;\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations;\n\u25cf new products or product enhancements introduced by Micronet or its competitors;\n\u25cf developments in patents and other intellectual property rights and litigation;\n\u25cf developments in relationships with third party manufacturers and/or strategic partners;\n\u25cf developments in relationships with customers and/or suppliers;\n\u25cf regulatory or legal developments in the United States, Israel, China and other countries;\n\u25cf general conditions in the global economy; and\n\u25cf the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nFor these reasons and others, you should consider an investment in our Common Stock as risky and invest only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuations in the value of such investment.\nA sale by MICT of a substantial number of shares of the Common Stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for Common Stock may cause the price of the Common Stock to decline and may impair the ability to raise capital in the future.\nOur Common Stock is traded on Nasdaq and despite certain increases of trading volume from time to time, there have been periods when it could be considered \u201cthinly-traded,\u201d meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing Common Stock at or near bid prices at any given time may have been relatively small or non-existent. Financing transactions resulting in a large amount of newly-issued securities, or other events that cause current stockholders to sell shares, could place downward pressure on the trading price of Common Stock. In addition, the lack of a robust resale market may require a stockholder who desires to sell a large number of shares of Common Stock to sell those shares in increments over time to mitigate any adverse impact of the sales on the market price of MICT stock. If MICT stockholders sell, or the market perceives that its stockholders intend to sell for various reasons, including the ending of restriction on resale, substantial amounts of Common Stock in the public market, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, the market price of Common Stock could fall. Sales of a substantial number of shares of Common Stock may make it more difficult for MICT to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that MICT deems reasonable or appropriate. Moreover, MICT may become involved in securities class action litigation arising out of volatility resulting from such sales that could divert management\u2019s attention and harm MICT\u2019s business.\nWe may acquire other companies or technologies, and the Tingo Merger could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may in the future seek to acquire or invest in other businesses, features or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our market, enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions including Tingo, may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated. In addition, to the extent that we enter into any term sheets or otherwise announce any intention to acquire any additional businesses, features or technologies, any such acquisition would generally be subject to completion of due diligence and required approvals, and would require additional financing, and there can be no assurance that any such acquisition will occur or be completed in a timely manner, or at all.\nIf we acquire additional businesses, we may not be able to integrate the acquired personnel, operations, existing contracts and technologies successfully or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from any acquired business, due to a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf failure to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices, product quality and safety, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or client issues;\n\u25cf difficulty incorporating acquired technology and rights into our proprietary software and of maintaining quality and security standards consistent with our brands;\n\u25cf inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition or investment costs;\n\u25cf incurrence of acquisition-related costs or equity dilution associated with funding the acquisition;\n\u25cf difficulties and additional expenses associated with supporting legacy products and hosting infrastructure of the acquired business;\n\u25cf risks of entering new markets or new product categories in which we have limited or no experience;\n\u25cf difficulty converting the customers of the acquired business into our customers;\n\u25cf diversion of our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u25cf adverse effects to our existing business relationships as a result of the acquisition;\n\u25cf potential loss of key employees, clients, vendors and suppliers from either our current business or an acquired company\u2019s business;\n\u25cf use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business;\n\u25cf possible write offs or impairment charges relating to acquired businesses;\n\u25cf compliance with regulatory matters covering the products of the acquired business; and\n\u25cf use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisition.\nIn addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our operating results based on this impairment assessment process, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our operating results. If an acquired business fails to meet our expectations, our business, operating results and financial condition may suffer.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports or publish unfavorable research about MICT\u2019s business, the price of its Common Stock could decline.\nMICT does not currently have any significant research coverage by securities and industry analysts and may never obtain such research coverage. If securities or industry analysts do not commence or maintain coverage of MICT, the trading price for its Common Stock might be negatively affected. In the event such securities or industry analyst coverage is obtained, if one or more of the analysts who covers MICT or will cover MICT downgrades its securities, the price of Common Stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover MICT or fails to publish regular reports on it, interest in the purchase of Common Stock could decrease, which could cause the price of Common Stock and trading volume to decline.\nIf we fail to continue to meet all applicable Nasdaq requirements, Nasdaq may delist our common stock, which could have an adverse impact on the liquidity and market price of our common stock.\nMICT\u2019s common stock is currently listed on Nasdaq, which has qualitative and quantitative listing criteria. If MICT continues to be unable to comply with Nasdaq listing requirements, including, for example, if the closing bid price for MICT common stock continues to fall below $1.00 per share, in breach of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), Nasdaq could determine to delist the MICT common stock which could adversely affect its market liquidity market price. In that regard, on January 27, 2022, MICT received written notice from Nasdaq indicating that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), as the closing bid price of its common stock had been below $1.00 per share. Nasdaq\u2019s letter advised the Company that, based upon the closing bid price during the period from December 21, 2021 to January 26, 2022, the Company no longer meets this test. MICT was able to regain compliance by maintaining a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days; however there can be no assurance that MICT will be able to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq listing requirements, or that the common stock will not be delisted from Nasdaq in the future. Such delisting could adversely affect the ability to obtain financing for the continuation of MICT\u2019s operations or prevent us from completing the Acquisition or any other alternative transaction, and could result in the loss of confidence by investors, customers and employees and cause our shareholders to incur substantial losses.\nIf Nasdaq delists MICT\u2019s securities from trading on its exchange and MICT is not able to list its securities on another national securities exchange, MICT expects its securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, MICT could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for its securities;\n\u25cf reduced liquidity for its securities;\n\u25cf a determination that the MICT\u2019s common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in the MICT\u2019s common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for MICT\u2019s securities;\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nMICT\u2019s stockholders may not realize a benefit from the Company\u2019s mergers commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the mergers.\nIf MICT is unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits anticipated from its merger with Tingo, MICT\u2019s stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests in MICT without receiving any commensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the commensurate benefit to the extent MICT is able to realize only part of the strategic and financial benefits anticipated from the mergers.\nIntermediate may be subject to new or different statutory and regulatory requirements in the British Virgin Islands (\u201cBVI\u201d).\nAs the global regulatory and tax environment evolves, Intermediate may be subject to new or different statutory and regulatory requirements (for example, on January 1, 2019 the Economic Substance (Companies and Limited Partnerships) Act, 2018 of the British Virgin Islands came into force). It is difficult to predict what impact the adoption of these laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations could have on Intermediate, however, compliance with various additional obligations may create significant additional costs that may be borne by Intermediate or otherwise affect the management and operation of Intermediate.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, or any other pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, may materially and adversely affect MICT\u2019s business and operations.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has since spread to multiple countries, including the United States, Israel and many European countries and affected the each of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries business as set hereunder. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic. While COVID-19 is still spreading and the final implications of the pandemic are difficult to estimate at this stage, it is clear that it has affected the lives of a large portion of the global population. At this time, the pandemic has caused states of emergency to be declared in various countries, travel restrictions imposed globally, quarantines established in certain jurisdictions and various institutions and companies being closed. MICT is actively monitoring the pandemic in order to respond the changing business and market conditions accordingly.\nManagement has considered the consequences of COVID-19 and other events and conditions, and it has determined that they do not create a material uncertainty that casts significant doubt upon the entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe impact of COVID-19 on future performance and therefore on the measurement of some assets and liabilities or on liquidity might be significant and might therefore require disclosure in the financial statements, but management has determined that they do not create a material uncertainty that casts significant doubt upon the entity\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern.\nMICT\u2019s operations and business have experienced disruptions due to the unprecedented conditions surrounding the spread of COVID-19 throughout China, North America, Israel and the world. The COVID-19 pandemic and both public and private measures taken to contain it have negatively affected MICT\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity, all of which may continue or worsen. The following are some of the issues that MICT continues to face:\n\u25cf Prolonged recessionary concerns. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant reduction of economic activity in the U.S., and the markets in which the Company operates as stated above as well as a significant increase in unemployment, which could lead to a prolonged economic recession;\n\u25cf Actual and potential delays in customer payments, defaults on the MICT\u2019s customer credit arrangements; or other failures by third parties such as suppliers, and distributors to meet their obligations to MICT due to their economic circumstances. The financial markets have also been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially causing operational cash flow issues for MICT, and potentially causing similar issues for MICT\u2019s customers, including, but not limited to, affecting their ability to meet their payment obligations to us; and\n\u25cf Interruptions in manufacturing or distribution of MICT\u2019s products. Outbreaks in the communities in which MICT operates could affect its ability to operate its manufacturing or distribution activities, and MICT\u2019s suppliers could experience similar interruptions.\nDue to the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, MICT will continue to assess the situation, including government-imposed restrictions, market by market. It is not possible at this time to estimate the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic could have on MICT\u2019s business, the continued spread of COVID-19, and any additional measures taken by governments, health officials or by MICT in response to such spread, could have on MICT\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation measures have also negatively impacted global economic conditions, which, in turn, could adversely affect MICT\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak continues to impact MICT\u2019s financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new government actions or restrictions, new information that may emerge concerning the severity, longevity and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on economic activity.\nEven after COVID-19 has subsided, MICT may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to its business as a result of its global economic impact, including any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. There are no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of COVID-19, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of COVID-19, or a similar health epidemic or pandemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change. While MICT continues to monitor the business metrics that it has historically used to predict its financial performance, it is uncertain as to whether these metrics will continue to function as they have in the past. COVID-19 cause shut downs of cities and may happen again and we were not able to file on time and may happen again in the future.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, or any other pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, may materially and adversely affect Intermediate\u2019s and Micronet\u2019s business and thereby have a material adverse effect on MICT\u2019s investment in Intermediate and Micronet.\nMICT may not realize the benefits of its investment in Intermediate and Micronet if as a result of, among other things, COVID-19, Intermediate\u2019s and Micronet\u2019s business and operations suffer a material adverse effect. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Micronet has suffered a material adverse impact on its business and operations, results of operations and financial condition due to, among other things, a delay in receiving customers\u2019 orders and the general negative economic climate that has resulted from COVID-19. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a material adverse change in the general business and economic atmosphere in the world and in Israel and a negative sentiment in both the business and capital markets, which includes a substantial and significant decrease in demand for the products offered by Micronet, leading to a slowdown in production and delivery, as well as the cancellation of orders by its customers or rejection of development by manufacturers and suppliers.\nMoreover, government restrictions imposed in China impacted Micronet\u2019s manufacturing and subcontracting operations in China were affected for a certain period of time due to COVID-19. Similarly, GFH\u2019s business and operations in China have been impacted by COVID-19 as well. In addition, activities related to the development of various components of Micronet\u2019s products have not yet returned to regular levels. Although the facilities overseeing a portion of these activities have returned to operation, GFH and Micronet do not know if limitations that were previously lifted will be reinstated or whether limitations that are still in effect will be lifted in the near term. As such, Micronet\u2019s management believes that there will be a delay in launching its new products to the market and they will not be completed before first quarter of 2021.\nWe have issued and may issue additional preferred stock in the future, and the terms of the preferred stock may reduce the value of our Common Stock.\nWe are authorized to issue up to 15,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. Our board of directors may determine the terms of future preferred stock offerings without further action by our stockholders. If we issue shares of preferred stock, it could affect stockholder rights or reduce the market value of our outstanding Common Stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, sinking fund provisions, and restrictions on our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party.\nMICT may be subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings, and may not always be successful in defending itself against such claims or proceedings.\nMICT\u2019s business operations entail substantial litigation and regulatory risks, including the risk of lawsuits and other legal actions relating to, among other matters, breach of contract, information disclosure, client onboarding procedures, sales practices, product design, fraud and misconduct, and control procedures deficiencies, as well as the protection of personal and confidential information of MICT\u2019s or Intermediate\u2019s or Micronet\u2019s clients. MICT or its subsidiaries may be subject to arbitration claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business. MICT or its subsidiaries may also be subject to inquiries, inspections, investigations and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies. MICT and its subsidiaries will be subject to extensive and evolving regulatory requirements, non-compliance with which, may result in penalties, limitations and prohibitions on its future business activities or suspension or revocation of its licenses and trading rights, and consequently may materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition, operations and prospects.\nAdditionally, the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby, as well as certain private placements completed by the Company, may give rise to litigation and/or other legal disputes. As previously disclosed, in March 2017, MICT entered into an Investment Banking Agreement (the \u201cSunrise Agreement\u201d) with Sunrise Securities LLC and Trump Securities LLC (collectively, \u201cSunrise\u201d) through Sunrise\u2019s principal, Amnon Mandelbaum, pursuant to which Sunrise agreed to assist MICT in identifying, analyzing, structuring, and negotiating suitable business opportunities, such as a sale of stock or assets, merger, tender offer, joint venture, financing arrangement, private placement, or any similar transaction or combination thereof. The parties had disagreements about, among other things, the applicability of the Sunrise Agreement, and the Company received demand letters and other correspondences from Sunrise threatening litigation in connection therewith. As of the date hereof, the parties have executed a settlement and release agreement for the release and waiver of the above claims however, MICT was not able to timely file a registration statement to register the shares, and shares underlying the warrants per the settlement agreement. The Sunrise parties notified MICT that it has breached the settlement agreement. MICT has made a significant offer to the Sunrise parties to settle such matter and is negotiating with the Sunrise parties to resolve this issue immediately. For further details see \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d below.\nActions brought against MICT or its subsidiaries may result in settlements, injunctions, fines, penalties, suspension or revocation of licenses, reprimands or other results adverse to it that could harm its reputation. Even if MICT is successful in defending itself against these actions, the costs of such defense may be significant. In market downturns, the number of legal claims and the amount of damages sought in legal proceedings may increase.\nIn addition, MICT may face arbitration claims and lawsuits brought by its or tis subsidiaries\u2019 users and clients who use its services and find them unsatisfactory. MICT may also encounter complaints alleging misrepresentation with regard to its platforms and/or services. Actions brought against MICT may result in settlements, awards, injunctions, fines, penalties or other results adverse to it including harm to its reputation. Even if MICT is successful in defending against these actions, the defense of such matters may result in its incurring significant expenses. Predicting the outcome of such matters is inherently difficult, particularly where claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages, or when arbitration or legal proceedings are at an early stage. A significant judgement or regulatory action against MICT or a material disruption in Intermediate\u2019s stock trading platform business arising from adverse adjudications in proceedings against the directors, officers or employees would have a material adverse effect on MICT\u2019s liquidity, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nBecause almost all of MICT\u2019s officers and directors are located in non-U.S. jurisdictions, you may have no effective recourse against management for misconduct.\nCurrently, a majority of MICT\u2019s directors and officers are or will be nationals and/or residents of countries other than the United States, and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against such officers or directors, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any U.S. state. Additionally, it may be difficult to enforce civil liabilities under U.S. securities law in original actions instituted in Israel, the UK or PRC. UK, PRC or Israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on a violation of U.S. securities laws because such jurisdictions are not the most appropriate forum to bring such a claim. In addition, even if such courts agree to hear a claim, they may determine that Israeli, UK or PRC law, as applicable, and not U.S. law is applicable to hear the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure may also be governed by UK, PRC or Israeli law.\nMICT\u2019s financial results may be negatively affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nMICT\u2019s revenues are mainly denominated in U.S. Dollars and prior to the Merger, costs were mainly denominated in New Israeli Shekels (\u201cNIS\u201d). Where possible, MICT matches sales and purchases in these and other currencies to achieve a natural hedge. Currently, Micronet does not have a policy with respect to the use of derivative instruments for hedging purposes, except that Micronet will consider engaging in such hedging activities on a case-by-case basis. To the extent MICT is unable to fully match sales and purchases in different currencies, its business will be exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Following the Merger, Intermediate\u2019s revenue and expenses have been and are expected to continue to be primarily denominated in RMB and we are exposed to the risks associated with the fluctuation in the currency exchange rate of RMB. Should RMB appreciate against other currencies, the value of the proceeds from this offering and any future financings, which are to be converted from U.S. dollar or other currencies into RMB, would be reduced and might accordingly hinder our business development due to the lessened amount of funds raised. Substantial fluctuation in the currency exchange rate of RMB may have a material adverse effect on Intermediate\u2019s business, operations and financial position and the value of your investment in the Units.\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021.\nWe conducted an evaluation under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, respectively), regarding the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2021 and management concluded that they were not effective. The five material weaknesses related to information technology and one material weakness related to engaging enough qualified employees knowledgeable in U.S. GAAP were directly related to our rapid growth, inability to timely integrate various information technology systems from all of its acquired businesses, the ongoing effects of COVID-19 and PRC regulations related thereto. See Item 9A Controls and Procedures for a further description of the identified material weaknesses. If we are unable to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and materially and adversely affect our business and operating results;\nRisk Factors Relating to Intermediate\u2019s Business\nIntermediate\u2019s trading platforms have no operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate Intermediate\u2019s future prospects.\nIntermediate is focused on developing its various trading platforms and technology infrastructure, which have not launched. As Intermediate\u2019s platforms will be built on technology and a significant portion of Intermediate\u2019s staff come from Internet and technology companies, Intermediate has limited experience in most aspects of its trading platform business operation. Any aspect of Intermediate\u2019s business model that does not achieve expected results may have a material and adverse impact on Intermediate\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. It is therefore difficult to effectively assess MICT\u2019s future prospects.\nIntermediate\u2019s targeted markets may not develop as expected. Intermediate\u2019s users and clients of Intermediate\u2019s services may not be familiar with the development of these markets and may have difficulty distinguishing Intermediate\u2019s services from those of Intermediate\u2019s competitors. Convincing users and clients of the value of using Intermediate\u2019s services will be critical to increasing the number of transactions on Intermediate\u2019s platforms and to the success of Intermediate businesses.\nYou should consider Intermediate\u2019s businesses in light of the risks and challenges it encounters or may encounter given the rapidly evolving markets in which it operates and its lack of operating history. These risks and challenges include our ability to, among other things:\n\u25cf manage the launch of its trading platforms and its future growth;\n\u25cf navigate a complex and evolving regulatory environment;\n\u25cf offer personalized and competitive services;\n\u25cf increase the utilization of its services by users and clients;\n\u25cf maintain and enhance its relationships with its business partners;\n\u25cf enhance its technology infrastructure to support the growth of its business and maintain the security of its systems and the confidentiality of the information provided and utilized across its systems;\n\u25cf improve its operational efficiency;\n\u25cf attract, retain and motivate talented employees to support its business growth;\n\u25cf navigate economic condition and fluctuation;\n\u25cf defend itself against legal and regulatory actions, such as actions involving intellectual property or privacy claims; and\n\u25cf obtain any and all licenses necessary for the operation of its business.\nIntermediate may not be able to manage its expansion effectively.\nIntermediate\u2019s current and planned personnel, systems, resources and controls may not be adequate to support and effectively manage its future operations. Intermediate\u2019s plans for continuous expansion may increase the complexity of its business and may place a strain on its management, operations, technical systems, financial resources and internal control functions. Intermediate intends to upgrade its systems from time to time to cater to the need of launching new services, and the process of upgrading its systems may disrupt its ability to timely and accurately process information, which could adversely affect its results of operations and cause harm to its business.\nIf Intermediate is unable to attract and retain clients, or if it fails to offer services to address the needs of its clients as it evolves, Intermediate\u2019s business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf there is insufficient demand for Intermediate\u2019s services, it might not be able to achieve and increase its transaction volume and revenues as it expects, and its and MICT\u2019s business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIntermediate\u2019s success will depend largely on its ability to attract and retain clients, in particular those that have highly frequent transactions. Failure to deliver services in a timely manner at competitive prices with satisfactory experience will cause clients to lose confidence in Intermediate and use its platforms less frequently or even stop using its platforms altogether, which in turn will materially and adversely affect Intermediate\u2019s business. Even if Intermediate is able to provide high-quality and satisfactory services on its platforms in a timely manner and at favorable price terms, MICT cannot assure you that Intermediate will be able to attract and retain clients, encourage repeat and increase trading transactions due to reasons out of its control, such as Intermediate\u2019s clients\u2019 personal financial reasons or the deterioration of the market conditions.\nIf Intermediate is unable to generate clients and increase its client retention rates in a cost-effective manner, Intermediate\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations are likely to be adversely affected. Although MICT expects to spend significant financial resources on marketing expenses, these efforts may not be cost-effective to attract clients to Intermediate. MICT cannot assure its investors that Intermediate will be able to gain, maintain, or grow a client base in a cost-effective way, if at all.\nMICT will depend on Intermediate\u2019s proprietary technology, and its future results may be impacted if it cannot maintain technological superiority in its industry.\nMICT\u2019s potential success depends on Intermediate\u2019s sophisticated proprietary technology to empower the efficient operations of its platforms. If Intermediate\u2019s technology becomes more widely available to its current or future competitors for any reason, its operating results may be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, to keep pace with changing technologies and client demands, Intermediate must correctly interpret and address market trends and enhance the features and functionality of its technology in response to these trends, which may lead to significant research and development costs. Intermediate may be unable to accurately determine the needs of its users and clients or the trends of the various industries it anticipates to enter or to design and implement the appropriate features and functionality of its technology in a timely and cost-effective manner, which could result in decreased demand for its services and a corresponding decrease in its revenue. Also, any adoption or development of similar or more advanced technologies by its competitors may require that MICT devotes substantial resources to the development of more advanced technology at Intermediate to remain competitive. The markets in which Intermediate competes are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and changing trading systems, practices and techniques. Intermediate may not be able to keep up with these rapid changes in the future, develop new technology, realize a return on amounts invested in developing new technologies or remain competitive in the future.\nIn addition, Intermediate must protect its systems against physical damage from fire, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hacker attacks, physical break-ins and similar events. Any software or hardware damage or failure that causes interruption or an increase in response time of its proprietary technology could reduce client satisfaction and decrease usage of its services.\nUnexpected network interruptions, security breaches or computer virus attacks and failures in Intermediate\u2019s information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIntermediate\u2019s information technology systems will support all phases of its operations and will be an essential part of its technology infrastructure. If Intermediate\u2019s systems fail to perform, it could experience disruptions in operations, slower response time or decreased customer satisfaction. Intermediate must be able to process, record and monitor a large number of transactions and its operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its systems. System interruptions, errors or downtime can result from a variety of causes, including unexpected interruptions to the Internet infrastructure, technological failures, changes to Intermediate\u2019s systems, changes in customer usage patterns, linkages with third-party systems and power failures. Intermediate\u2019s systems will also be vulnerable to disruptions from human error, execution errors, errors in models such as those used for risk management and compliance, employee misconduct, unauthorized trading, external fraud, distributed denial of service attacks, computer viruses or cyberattacks, terrorist attacks, natural disaster, power outage, capacity constraints, software flaws, events impacting Intermediate\u2019s key business partners and vendors, and other similar events.\nIntermediate\u2019s Internet-based businesses depend on the performance and reliability of the Internet infrastructure. Intermediate cannot assure its investors that the Internet infrastructure it depends on will remain sufficiently reliable for its needs. Any failure to maintain the performance, reliability, security or availability of Intermediate\u2019s network infrastructure may cause significant damage to its ability to attract and retain users and clients. Major risks involving Intermediate\u2019s network infrastructure include:\n\u25cf breakdowns or system failures resulting in a prolonged shutdown of its servers;\n\u25cf disruption or failure in the national backbone networks in the PRC, which would make it impossible for users and clients to access its platforms;\n\u25cf damage from natural disasters or other catastrophic events such as typhoon, volcanic eruption, earthquake, flood, telecommunications failure, or other similar events; and\n\u25cf any infection by or spread of computer viruses or other system failures.\nAny network interruption or inadequacy that causes interruptions in the availability of Intermediate\u2019s platforms or deterioration in the quality of access to its platforms could reduce user and client satisfaction and result in a reduction in the activity level of its users and clients as well as the number of clients making trading transactions on its platforms. Furthermore, increases in the volume of traffic on Intermediate\u2019s platforms could strain the capacity of its computer systems and bandwidth, which could lead to slower response times or system failures. This could cause a disruption or suspension in Intermediate\u2019s service delivery, which could hurt its brand and reputation. Intermediate may need to incur additional costs to upgrade its technology infrastructure and computer systems in order to accommodate increased demand if it anticipates that its systems cannot handle higher volumes of traffic and transaction in the future. In addition, it could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to its technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen occurrence, which could affect its ability to process and settle client transactions. Despite Intermediate\u2019s efforts to identify areas of risk, oversee operational areas involving risks, and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks, there can be no assurance that it will not suffer unexpected losses, reputational damage or regulatory actions due to technology or other operational failures or errors, including those of its vendors or other third parties.\nFailure or poor performance of third-party software, infrastructure or systems on which Intermediate relies could adversely affect its business.\nIntermediate will rely on third parties to provide and maintain certain infrastructure that will be critical to its business. For example, a strategic partner provides services to Intermediate in connection with various aspects of Intermediate\u2019s operations and systems. If such services become limited, restricted, curtailed or less effective or more expensive in any way or become unavailable to Intermediate for any reason, its business may be materially and adversely affected. The infrastructure of Intermediate\u2019s third-party service providers may malfunction or fail due to events out of its control, which could disrupt its operations and have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Any failure to maintain and renew Intermediate\u2019s relationships with these third parties on commercially favorable terms, or to enter into similar relationships in the future, could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIntermediate also relies on certain third-party software, computer systems and service providers. Any interruption in these third-party services or software, deterioration in their performance, or other improper operation could interfere with its trading activities, cause losses due to erroneous or delayed responses, or otherwise be disruptive to its business. If Intermediate\u2019s arrangements with any third party are terminated, it may not be able to find an alternative source of software or systems support on a timely basis or on commercially reasonable terms. This could also have a material adverse effect on Intermediate\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf Intermediate fails to protect its platform or the confidential information of its users and clients, whether due to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or other reasons, it may be subject to liabilities imposed by relevant laws and regulations, and its reputation and business may be materially and adversely affected.\nMICT\u2019s and Intermediate\u2019s computer system, the networks it uses, the networks and online trading platforms of the exchanges and other third parties with whom it interacts, are potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic computer break-ins, viruses and similar disruptive problems or security breaches. A party that is able to circumvent MICT\u2019s or Intermediate\u2019s security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or customer information, jeopardize the confidential nature of the information MICT or Intermediate transmits over the Internet and mobile network or cause interruptions in its operations. MICT, Intermediate or its respective service providers may be required to invest significant resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches.\nIn addition, MICT and Intermediate will collect, store and process certain personal and other sensitive data from its users and clients, which makes MICT and Intermediate potentially vulnerable targets to cyber-attacks, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins or similar disruptions. While MICT and Intermediate will take steps to protect the confidential information that it expects to have access to, its security measures could be breached. Because the techniques used to sabotage or obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, MICT and Intermediate may not be able to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. Any accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access to MICT\u2019s or Intermediate\u2019s system could cause confidential user and client information to be stolen and used for criminal purposes. Security breaches or unauthorized access to confidential information could also expose MICT and Intermediate to liability related to the loss of the information, time-consuming and expensive litigation and negative publicity. If security measures are breached because of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, or if design flaws in MICT\u2019s or Intermediate\u2019s technology infrastructure are exposed and exploited, its relationships with users and clients could be severely damaged, it could incur significant liability and its stock trading platform business and operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, Intermediate\u2019s corporate clients may utilize its technology to serve their own employees and customers. Any failure or perceived failure by MICT or Intermediate to prevent information security breaches or to comply with privacy policies or privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personally identifiable information or other customer data, could cause Intermediate\u2019s clients to lose trust in it and could expose Intermediate to legal claims.\nThere are uncertainties as to the interpretation and application of laws in one jurisdiction which may be interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent to another jurisdiction and may conflict with MICT\u2019s or Intermediate\u2019s policies and practices or require changes to the features of its system. MICT and Intermediate cannot assure that its user information protection system and technical measures will be considered sufficient under applicable laws and regulations. If MICT or Intermediate is unable to address any information protection concerns, any compromise of security that results unauthorized disclosure or transfer of personal data, or to comply with the then applicable laws and regulations, it may incur additional costs and liability and result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity and could cause its users and clients to lose trust in us, which could have a material adverse effect on its stock trading platform business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. MICT and Intermediate may also be subject to new laws, regulations or standards or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations or standards, including those in the areas of data security and data privacy, which could require MICT or Intermediate to incur additional costs and restrict its stock trading platform business operations.\nOur business and reputation may be harmed by changes in business, economic or political conditions that impact global financial markets, or by a systemic market event.\nAs the Company offers financial services, our business, results of operations and reputation are directly affected by elements beyond our control, such as economic and political conditions, changes in the volatility in financial markets (including volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), significant increases in the volatility or trading volume of particular securities, broad trends in business and finance, changes in volume of securities trading generally, changes in the markets in which such transactions occur and changes in how such transactions are processed. These elements can arise suddenly and the full impact of such conditions can remain uncertain. A prolonged weakness in equity markets, such as a slowdown causing reduction in trading volume in securities, derivatives or cryptocurrency markets, may result in reduced revenues and would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Significant downturns in the securities markets or in general economic and political conditions may also cause individuals to be reluctant to make their own investment decisions and thus decrease the demand for our products and services and could also result in our customers reducing their engagement with our platform. Conversely, significant upturns in the securities markets or in general economic and political conditions may cause individuals to be less proactive in seeking ways to improve the returns on their trading or investment decisions and, thus, decrease the demand for our products and services. Any of these changes could cause our future performance to be uncertain or unpredictable, and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, some market participants could be overleveraged. In case of sudden, large price movements, such market participants may not be able to meet their obligations to their respective brokers who, in turn, may not be able to meet their obligations to their counterparties. As a result, the financial system or a portion thereof could suffer, and the impact of such an event could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, a prolonged weakness in the U.S. equity markets or a general economic downturn could cause our customers to incur losses, which in turn could cause our brand and reputation to suffer. If our reputation is harmed, the willingness of our existing customers, and potential new customers, to do business with us could be negatively impacted, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets, and many of our competitors have greater resources than we do and may have products and services that may be more appealing than ours to our current or potential customers.\nThe markets in which we compete are evolving and highly competitive, with multiple participants competing for the same customers. Our current and potential future competition principally comes from incumbent discount brokerages, established financial technology companies, venture-backed financial technology firms, banks, cryptocurrency exchanges, asset management firms and technology platforms. The majority of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater capital resources than we have and offer a wider range of products and services. The impact of competitors with superior name recognition, greater market acceptance, larger customer bases or stronger capital positions could adversely affect our results of operations and customer acquisition and retention. Our competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities and demands and withstand changing market conditions better than we can, especially larger competitors that may benefit from more diversified product and customer bases. For example, some of our competitors have quickly adopted, or are seeking to adopt, some of our key offerings and services, including commission-free trading, fractional share trading and no account minimums, since their introduction on our platform to compete with us. In addition, competitors may conduct extensive promotional activities, offer better terms or offer differentiating products and services that could attract our current and prospective customers and potentially result in intensified competition within our markets. We continue to experience aggressive price competition in our markets and we may not be able to match the marketing efforts or prices of our competitors. We may also be subject to increased competition as our competitors enter into business combinations or partnerships, or established companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business.\nIn addition, we compete in a technology-intensive market characterized by rapid innovation. Some of our competitors in this market, including new and emerging competitors, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or scrutiny to which we are subject, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage, in particular in the development of new technology platforms or the ability to rapidly innovate. We may be unable to effectively use new technologies, adapt our products and services to emerging market standards or develop or introduce and market enhanced or new products and services. If we are not able to update or adapt our products and services to take advantage of the latest technologies and standards, or are otherwise unable to tailor the delivery of our services to the latest personal and mobile computing devices preferred by our customers or to provide products or services that are of a quality preferred by our customers, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nOur ability to compete successfully in the financial services market depends on a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u25cf providing easy-to-use, innovative and attractive products and services, as well as effective customer support;\n\u25cf maintaining and expanding our market position;\n\u25cf attracting and retaining customers;\n\u25cf our reputation and the market perception of our brand and overall value;\n\u25cf maintaining our relationships with our counterparties;\n\u25cf maintaining competitive pricing;\n\u25cf competing in a competitive landscape, including in the provision of products and services that have until recently been available only from our bank competitors;\n\u25cf the effectiveness, reliability and stability of our technology (including the success of our outage prevention efforts and our cybersecurity measures and defenses), products and services;\n\u25cf innovating effectively in launching new or enhanced products and services;\n\u25cf adjusting to a dynamic regulatory environment;\n\u25cf the differences in regulatory oversight regimes to which we and our competitors are subject; and\n\u25cf general economic and market trends, including customer demand for financial products and services.\nOur competitive position within our markets could be adversely affected if we are unable to adequately address these factors, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to retain existing customers or attract new customers, or if our customers decrease their use of our products and services, our growth could be slower than we expect and our business may be harmed.\nOur continued business and revenue growth is dependent on our ability to attract new customers, retain existing customers, increase the amount that our customers use our products and services and sell our premium services, and we cannot be sure that we will be successful in these efforts. There are a number of factors that could lead to a decline in our number of customers or their usage of our products and services, or that could prevent us from increasing our number of customers, including:\n\u25cf our failure to introduce new products or services, or our introduction of new products or services, or changes in our existing products or services, that are not favorably received;\n\u25cf pricing for our products and services;\n\u25cf harm to our brand and reputation, or decreases in the perceived quality, reliability or usefulness of our products and services;\n\u25cf our customers engaging with competitive products and services;\n\u25cf our customers having difficulty installing, updating or otherwise accessing the our app on mobile devices as a result of actions by us or third parties that we rely on to distribute our app;\n\u25cf our customers experiencing security breaches, account intrusions or other unauthorized access as a result of actions by us or our business partners, including third parties that we rely on to distribute the application;\n\u25cf our failure to provide adequate customer service to our customers;\n\u25cf a cybersecurity attack, data breach or other security incident resulting in loss in customer confidence;\n\u25cf our inability to manage network or service outages, interruptions and internet disruptions, including during times of high trading activity, or other performance or technical problems that prevent our customers from accessing and managing their accounts or assets in a rapid and reliable manner;\n\u25cf changes in our customers\u2019 investment strategies or level of interest in investing;\n\u25cf the enactment of proposed legislation that would impose taxes on certain financial transactions;\n\u25cf changes mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities or litigation that adversely affect our products and services, or our ability to provide them to our customers;\n\u25cf any restrictions on trading that we impose on our platform as a result of the capital requirements and cash deposit and collateral requirements to; and\n\u25cf deteriorating general economic conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or a general downturn in the equity markets.\nAs we expand our business operations and enter new markets, new challenges in attracting and retaining customers will arise that we may not successfully address. Our success, and our ability to increase revenues and operate profitably, depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively acquire new customers, to retain existing customers and to keep existing customers engaged so that they continue to use our products and services. Our customers may choose to cease using our platform, products and services at any time, and may choose to transfer their accounts to another broker-dealer.\nMany of our customers could be first-time investors and our trading volumes and revenues could be reduced if these customers stop trading altogether or stop using our platform for their investing activities.\nOur platform focuses on making the financial markets accessible to a broad demographic of retail investors. Our success, and our ability to increase revenues and operate profitably, depends in part on such customers continuing to utilize our platform, even as global social and economic conditions shift. However, our customers do not have long-term contractual arrangements with us and can utilize our platform on a transaction-by-transaction basis and may also cease to use our platforms at any time. We may face particular challenges in retaining these investors as customers, for example as a result of a return to pre-COVID-19 behaviors, increased volatility in the financial markets or increasing availability of competing products that seek to target the same demographic. In particular, a broad decline in the equity or other financial markets could result in some of these investors exiting the markets and leaving our platform. Any significant loss of customers or a significant reduction in their use of our platform could have a material impact on our trading volumes and revenues, and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur introduction of new products and services, or changes to existing products and services, could fail to attract or retain customers or generate growth and revenue.\nOur ability to attract, engage and retain our customers and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to maintain and evolve our existing products and services and to create successful new products and services. We may introduce significant changes to our existing products and services or acquire or introduce new and unproven products and services, including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience. We continue to incur substantial costs, and we may not be successful in continuing to generate profits, in connection with these efforts. In addition, the introduction of new products and services, or changes to existing products and services, may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny or other complications that could adversely affect our business and results of operations. If our new or enhanced products and services fail to attract customers, or if our business plans are unsuccessful, we may fail to attract or retain customers or to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin or other value to justify our investments, and our business may be adversely affected.\nIf we do not keep pace with industry and technological changes and continue to provide new and innovative products and services, our business may become less competitive and our business may be adversely impacted.\nRapid and significant technological changes continue to confront the financial services industry, including developments in the methods in which securities are traded. If we fail to innovate and deliver products and services with market fit and differentiation, or fail to do so quickly enough as compared to our competitors, we may not be able to keep pace with industry and technological changes in our industry and we may face difficulty in competing within our market, which could harm our business.\nWe expect new technologies, products, services and industry norms to continue to emerge and evolve, and we cannot predict the effects of technological changes or industry practices on our business. Further, new technologies introduced in our markets may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currently use in our products and services. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time, and we may not be successful in realizing a return on these development efforts in a timely manner or at all. Our ability to successfully adopt new products and services and to develop and incorporate new technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, changes to laws and regulations, changing customer expectations, demands and preferences or third-party intellectual property rights. If we are unable to enhance our products and services or to innovate or to develop new products and services that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with rapid technological developments and evolving industry standards or practices, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe will need to continuously modify, enhance and improve our products and services to keep pace with changes in internet-related hardware, mobile operating systems such as iOS and other software, communication, browser and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications, enhancements and improvements or in bringing them to market quickly or cost-effectively in response to market demands. Furthermore, uncertainties about the timing and nature of new network platforms or technologies, or modifications to existing platforms or technologies, could increase our research and development expenses. Any failure of our products and services to keep pace with technological changes or to innovate or to operate effectively with future network platforms and technologies, or to do so in a timely and cost-effective manner, could reduce the demand for our products and services, result in customer dissatisfaction and negative publicity, reduce our competitive advantage and harm our business and reputation.\nOur products and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical, and if these systems contain errors, bugs or vulnerabilities, or if we are unsuccessful in addressing or mitigating technical limitations or vulnerabilities in our systems, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur trading platform relies on software, including software developed or maintained internally and by third parties, that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our platform and our internal systems depend on the ability of such software, which includes machine learning models, to collect, store, retrieve, transmit, manage and otherwise process immense amounts of data. The software on which we rely may contain errors, bugs or vulnerabilities, and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise our ability to meet our objectives. Some errors, bugs or vulnerabilities inherently may be difficult to detect and may only be discovered after code has been released for external or internal use. Errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, design defects or technical limitations within the software on which we rely may lead to negative customer experiences (including the communication of inaccurate information to customers), compromised ability of our products to perform in a manner consistent with customer expectations, delayed product introductions, compromised ability to protect the data (including personal data) of our customers and our intellectual property or an inability to provide some or all of our services. Such errors, bugs, vulnerabilities or defects could also be exploited by malicious actors and result in exposure of data of customers on our platform, or otherwise result in a security breach or other security incident. We may need to expend significant financial and development resources to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work around errors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any failure to timely and effectively resolve any such errors, bugs, vulnerabilities or defects in the software on which we rely, and any associated degradations or interruptions of service, could result in damage to our reputation, loss of customers, loss of revenue, regulatory or governmental inquiries, civil litigation, or liability for damages, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends in part upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, hardware and standards that we do not control.\nA substantial majority of our customers\u2019 activity on our platform occurs on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to feature our app, or that mobile device customers will continue to use our products and services rather than those of our competitors. We are dependent on the interoperability of our app with popular mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, hardware and standards that we do not control, such as mobile device operating systems. Any changes, bugs or technical issues in such systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners, device manufacturers or mobile carriers, or in their terms of service or policies that degrade the functionality of our app, reduce or eliminate our ability to distribute applications, give preferential treatment to competitive products, limit our ability to target or measure the effectiveness of applications, or impose fees or other charges related to our delivery of our application could adversely affect customer usage of our app. Further, we are subject to the standard policies and terms of service of these operating systems, as well as policies and terms of service of the various application stores that make our application and experiences available to our developers, creators and customers. These policies and terms of service govern the availability, promotion, distribution, content and operation generally of applications and experiences on such operating systems and stores. Each provider of these operating systems and stores has broad discretion to change and interpret its terms of service and policies with respect to our platform and those changes may be unfavorable to us and our developers\u2019, creators\u2019 and customers\u2019 use of our platform. If we were to violate, or an operating system provider or application store believes that we have violated, its terms of service or policies, that operating system provider or application store could limit or discontinue our access to its operating system or store. In some cases, these requirements may not be clear or our interpretation of the requirements may not align with the interpretation of the operating system provider or application store, which could lead to inconsistent enforcement of these terms of service or policies against us, and could also result in the operating system provider or application store limiting or discontinuing access to its operating system or store. Any limitation or discontinuation of our access to any third-party platform or application store could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAdditionally, in order to deliver a high-quality mobile experience for our customers, it is important that our products and services work well with a range of mobile technologies, products, systems, networks, hardware and standards that we do not control, and that we have good relationships with mobile operating system partners, device manufacturers and mobile carriers. We may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, products, systems, networks or standards. In the event that it is more difficult for our customers to access and use our app, or if our customers choose not to access or use our app on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to our app, our customer growth and engagement could be harmed. In the event that our customers are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate, our customer growth and engagement could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed.\nEmployee misconduct could expose the Company to significant legal liability and reputational harm.\nIntermediate\u2019s platforms will operate in industries in which integrity and the confidence of its users and clients are of critical importance. During Intermediate\u2019s daily operations, it will be subject to the risks of errors and misconduct by its employees, which include:\n\u25cf engaging in misrepresentation or fraudulent activities when marketing or performing services to users and clients;\n\u25cf improperly using or disclosing confidential information of its users and clients or other parties;\n\u25cf concealing unauthorized or unsuccessful activities; or\n\u25cf otherwise not complying with applicable laws and regulations or its internal policies or procedures.\nIf any of Intermediate\u2019s employees engages in illegal or suspicious activities or other misconduct, it could suffer serious harm to its reputation, financial condition, client relationships and ability to attract new clients and even be subject to regulatory sanctions and significant legal liability. Intermediate may also be subject to negative publicity from the sanction that would adversely affect its brand, public image and reputation, as well as potential challenges, suspicions, investigations or alleged claims against us. It is not always possible to deter misconduct by its employees or senior management during the operations of its business or uncover any misconduct occurred in their past employment, and the precautions Intermediate takes to detect and prevent any misconduct may not always be effective. Misconduct by Intermediate\u2019s employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in a material adverse effect on its reputation and its business.\nMICT anticipates that its operating costs and expenses will increase.\nMICT anticipates that its operating costs and expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as it endeavors to launch and grow Intermediate\u2019s business, attract users and clients, enhance and develop its service offerings, enhance its technology capabilities, and increase its brand recognition. These efforts may prove more costly than MICT anticipates, and it may not succeed in generating revenues sufficiently to offset these higher expenses. There are other external and internal factors that could negatively affect MICT\u2019s financial condition. For example, the transaction volume achieved on Intermediate\u2019s platforms may be lower than expected, which may lead to lower than expected revenues. Furthermore, MICT has adopted a share incentive plan in the past and may adopt new share incentive plans in the future, which have caused, and will result in, significant share-based compensation expenses to us. As a result of the foregoing and other factors, MICT may incur net losses in the future.\nIf there is any negative publicity with respect to MICT, its industry peers or its industries in general, MICT\u2019s business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nMICT\u2019s reputation and brand recognition plays an important role in earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of its current and potential users and clients. MICT\u2019s reputation and brand are vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or impossible to remediate. Regulatory inquiries or investigations, lawsuits initiated by clients or other third parties, employee misconduct, perceptions of conflicts of interest and rumors, among other things, could substantially damage MICT\u2019s reputation, even if they are baseless or satisfactorily addressed. In addition, any perception that the quality of its services may not be the same as or better than that of other companies can also damage its reputation. Moreover, any negative media publicity about the industries in general or product or service quality problems of other firms in these industries, including MICT\u2019s competitors, may also negatively impact MICT\u2019s reputation and brand. If MICT is unable to maintain a good reputation or further enhance its brand recognition, its ability to attract and retain users, clients, third-party partners and key employees could be harmed and, as a result, its business and revenues would be materially and adversely affected.\nMICT may not succeed in promoting and sustaining its brand, which could have an adverse effect on its future growth and business.\nA critical component of MICT\u2019s launch and growth will be its ability to promote and sustain its brand. Promoting and positioning MICT\u2019s brand and platforms will depend largely on the success of its marketing efforts, its ability to attract users and clients cost-efficiently and its ability to consistently provide high-quality services and a superior experience. MICT expects to incur significant expenses related to advertising and other marketing efforts, which may not be effective and may adversely affect its net margins.\nIn addition, to provide a high-quality user and client experience, MICT expects to invest substantial amounts of resources in the development and functionality of Intermediate\u2019s platforms, websites, technology infrastructure and client service operations. Intermediate\u2019s ability to provide a high-quality user and client experience will also be highly dependent on external factors over which it may have little or no control, including, without limitation, the reliability and performance of software vendors and business partners. Failure to provide Intermediate\u2019s users and clients with high quality services and experience for any reason could substantially harm its reputation and adversely impact its efforts to develop a trusted brand, which could have a material adverse effect on its stock trading platform business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIntermediate\u2019s platform and internal systems rely on software and technological infrastructure that is highly technical, and if they contain undetected errors, its business could be adversely affected.\nIntermediate\u2019s platforms and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and complex. In addition, Intermediate\u2019s platforms and internal systems depend on the ability of the software to store, retrieve, process and manage immense amounts of data. The software may now or in the future contain, undetected errors or bugs. Some errors may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. Errors or other design defects within the software on which Intermediate relies may result in a negative experience for users and clients, delay introductions of new features or enhancements, result in errors or compromise Intermediate\u2019s ability to protect data or its intellectual property. Any errors, bugs or defects discovered in the software on which it relies could result in harm to Intermediate\u2019s reputation, loss of users or financial service providers or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial conditions.\nAny failure to protect Intermediate\u2019s intellectual property could harm its business and competitive position.\nIntermediate expects to rely primarily on trade secret, contract, copyright, trademark and patent law to protect its proprietary technology. It is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use Intermediate\u2019s proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on its rights. Intermediate may not be able to successfully pursue claims for infringement that interfere with its ability to use its technology, website or other relevant intellectual property or have adverse impact on its brand. Intermediate cannot assure MICT\u2019s investors that any of its intellectual property rights would not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or such intellectual property will be sufficient to provide Intermediate with competitive advantages. In addition, other parties may misappropriate its intellectual property rights, which would cause it to suffer economic or reputational damages. Because of the rapid pace of technological change, MICT cannot assure you that all of Intermediate\u2019s proprietary technologies and similar intellectual property will be patented in a timely or cost-effective manner, or at all. Furthermore, parts of Intermediate\u2019s business rely on technologies developed or licensed by other parties, or co-developed with other parties, and Intermediate may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these other parties on reasonable terms, or at all.\nAny claims or litigation could cause Intermediate and us to incur significant expenses and, if successfully asserted against Intermediate or us, could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, restrict Intermediate or us from conducting our business or require that we or Intermediate comply with other unfavorable terms. We and Intermediate may also be obligated to indemnify parties or pay substantial settlement costs, including royalty payments, in connection with any such claim or litigation and to obtain licenses, modify applications or refund fees, which could be costly. Even if we and Intermediate were to prevail in such a dispute, any litigation regarding Intermediate\u2019s intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management from Intermediate and our business operations.\nFrom time-to-time MICT may evaluate and potentially consummate investments and acquisitions or enter into alliances, which may require significant management attention, disrupt Intermediate\u2019s stock trading platform business and adversely affect its financial results.\nMICT may evaluate and consider strategic investments, combinations, acquisitions or alliances to further increase the value of Intermediate\u2019s platforms and better serve Intermediate\u2019s users and clients. These transactions could be material to its financial condition and results of operations if consummated. MICT may not have the financial resources necessary to consummate any acquisitions in the future or the ability to obtain the necessary funds on satisfactory terms. Any future acquisitions may result in significant transaction expenses and risks associated with entering new markets in addition to integration and consolidation risks. MICT may not have sufficient management, financial and other resources to integrate any such future acquisitions or to successfully operate new businesses, and it may be unable to profitably operate its expanded company.\nInternet-related issues may reduce or slow the growth in the use of our services in the future. In particular, our future growth depends on the further acceptance of the Internet in China and particularly the mobile Internet as an effective platform for assessing trading and other financial services and content.\nCritical issues concerning the commercial use of the Internet, such as ease of access, security, privacy, reliability, cost, and quality of service, remain unresolved and may adversely impact the growth of Internet use. If Internet usage continues to increase rapidly, the Internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by this growth, and its performance and reliability may decline. Continuous rapid growth in Internet traffic may cause decreased performance, outages and delays. Our ability to increase the speed with which we provide services to users and clients and to increase the scope and quality of such services is limited by and dependent upon the speed and reliability of Intermediate\u2019s users\u2019 and clients\u2019 access to the Internet, which is beyond our control. If periods of decreased performance, outages or delays on the Internet occur frequently or other critical issues concerning the Internet are not resolved, overall Internet usage or usage of our web-based services could increase more slowly or decline, which would cause Intermediate\u2019s stock trading platform business, results of operations and financial condition to be materially and adversely affected.\nIntermediate faces risks related to natural disasters, health epidemics and other outbreaks, which could significantly disrupt its operations.\nIntermediate\u2019s stock trading platform business could be materially and adversely affected by natural disasters, health epidemics or other public safety concerns. Natural disasters may give rise to server interruptions, breakdowns, system failures, technology platform failures or Internet failures, which could cause the loss or corruption of data or malfunctions of software or hardware as well as adversely affect its ability to operate its platform and provide services and solutions. Intermediate\u2019s stock trading platform business could also be adversely affected if its employees are affected by health epidemics. In addition, Intermediates\u2019 results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that any health epidemic harms the economy in general. If any natural disasters, health epidemics or other public safety concerns were to affect the locations where Intermediate operates, its operation may experience material disruptions, which may materially and adversely affect its stock trading platform business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Doing Business in China\nChanges in China\u2019s economic, political or social conditions or government policies could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nIntermediate division\u2019s principal executive office and operations, through its operating subsidiaries, are located in China. We also plan to launch various platforms which are being built initially in China. Accordingly, MICT\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be influenced to a significant degree by political, economic, social conditions and government policies in China generally. The Chinese economy differs from the economies of most developed countries in many respects, including the level of government involvement, level of development, growth rate, control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. Although the PRC government has implemented measures emphasizing the utilization of market forces for economic reform, the reduction of state ownership of productive assets, and the establishment of improved corporate governance in business enterprises, a substantial portion of productive assets in China is still owned by the government. In addition, the PRC government continues to play a significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policies. The PRC government also exercises significant control over China\u2019s economic growth through allocating resources, controlling payment of foreign currency-denominated obligations, setting monetary policy, and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.\nWhile the Chinese economy has experienced significant growth over the past decades, such growth has been uneven, both geographically and among various sectors of the economy, and the rate of growth has been slowing since 2012. Any adverse changes in economic conditions in China, in the policies of the PRC government or in the laws and regulations in China, could have a material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of China. Such developments could adversely affect MICT\u2019s business and operating results, lead to reduction in demand for MICT\u2019s services and adversely affect MICT\u2019s competitive position. COVID-19 had a severe and negative impact on Chinese and global economy in the past few years. Whether this will lead to a prolonged downturn in the economy is still unknown. The PRC government has implemented various measures to encourage economic growth and guide the allocation of resources. Some of these measures may benefit the overall Chinese economy, but may have a negative effect on us. For example, our Intermediate division\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by government control over capital investments or changes in tax regulations. In addition, in the past the PRC government has implemented certain measures, including interest rate adjustment, to control the pace of economic growth. These measures may cause decreased economic activity in China, which may adversely affect our Intermediate division\u2019s business and operating results.\nThe PRC legal system embodies uncertainties which could limit the legal protections available to us.\nPRC laws and the PRC legal system in general may have a significant impact on our business operations in China. Although China\u2019s legal system has developed over the last several decades, PRC laws, regulations and legal requirements remain underdeveloped relative to the United States of America. Moreover, PRC laws and regulations change frequently and their interpretation and enforcement involve uncertainties. For example, the interpretation or enforcement of PRC laws and regulations may be subject to government rules or policies, some of which are not published on a timely basis or at all. In addition, the relative inexperience of China\u2019s judiciary system in some cases may create uncertainty as to the outcome of litigation. These uncertainties could limit our ability to enforce certain legal or contractual rights or otherwise adversely affect our business and operations.\nFurthermore, due to the existence of unpublished rules and policies, and since newly issued PRC laws and regulations may have expected and unexpected retrospective effects, we may not be aware of a violation of certain PRC laws, regulations, policies or rules until after the event.\nThe complexities, uncertainties and rapid changes in PRC regulation of the Internet-related businesses and companies require significant resources for compliance.\nThe PRC government extensively regulates the Internet industries, including foreign ownership of, and the licensing and permit requirements pertaining to, companies doing business in the Internet industry. These laws and regulations are relatively new and evolving, and their interpretation and enforcement involve significant uncertainty. As a result, in certain circumstances it may be difficult to determine what actions or omissions may be deemed to be in violation of applicable laws and regulations. Issues, risks and uncertainties relating to PRC regulation of these businesses include, but are not limited to, the following:\nThere are uncertainties relating to the regulation of the Internet-related businesses in China, including evolving licensing practices. This means that certain of our permits, licenses or operations may be subject to challenge, or we may fail to obtain permits or licenses that may be deemed necessary for operations.\nNew laws and regulations that regulate Internet activities, including operating online platforms for insurance intermediary may be promulgated. If these new laws and regulations are promulgated, additional licenses may be required for operations. If our operations do not comply with these new regulations after they become effective, or if we fail to obtain any licenses required under these new laws and regulations, MICT or its subsidiaries could be subject to penalties.\nThe principal regulation governing the operation of Internet insurance business is the Measures for the Regulation of Internet Insurance Business, or Regulation of Internet Insurance Business, promulgated by the CBIRC on December 7, 2020 and effective on February 1, 2021. There is no assurance that Intermediate would be able to meet all the requirements set forth under the Regulation of Internet Insurance Business and effectively operate an online insurance brokerage business. Please refer to \u201cRegulation of Internet Insurance Businesses\u201d.\nThe interpretation and application of existing PRC laws, regulations and policies and any new laws, regulations or policies relating to the Internet-related industries have created substantial uncertainties regarding the legality of existing and future foreign investments in, and the businesses and activities of companies in these industries. We cannot assure you that Intermediate had obtained all the permits or licenses required for conducting its business in China or will be able to maintain existing licenses or obtain any new licenses required under any new laws or regulations. There are also risks associated with being found in violation of existing or future laws and regulations given the uncertainty and complexity of China\u2019s regulation of these businesses.\nIn addition, new laws and regulations applicable to the Internet-related industries could be issued at the national or provincial level, or existing regulations could be interpreted more strictly. No assurance can be given that business on these industries in general or our services in particular will not be adversely impacted by further regulations. In particular, technical limitations on Internet use can also be developed or implemented. For example, restrictions can be implemented on personal Internet use in the workplace in general or access to Intermediate\u2019s sites in particular. All such regulations, restrictions and limitations could lead to a reduction of user activities or a loss of users, and restrict the types of products and services we may be able to offer in China, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in China.\nThe 2006 M&A Rules established complex procedures for some acquisitions of Chinese companies by foreign investors, which could make it difficult to pursue growth through acquisitions in China.\nOn August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory authorities promulgated the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestics Enterprises by Foreign Investors (the \u201c2006 M&A Rules\u201d), which were later amended on June 22, 2009. The 2006 M&A Rules and some other regulations and rules concerning mergers and acquisitions established additional procedures and requirements that could make merger and acquisition activities by foreign investors more time consuming and complex, including requirements in some instances that the Ministry of Commerce, People\u2019s Republic of China (\u201cMOFCOM\u201d) be notified in advance of any change-of-control transaction in which a foreign investor takes control of a PRC domestic enterprise. Moreover, the Anti-Monopoly Law of China requires that the anti-monopoly law enforcement authority shall be notified in advance of any concentration of undertaking if certain thresholds are triggered. In addition, the security review rules issued by the State Council that became effective in September 2011 specify that mergers and acquisitions by foreign investors that raise \u201cnational defense and security\u201d concerns and mergers and acquisitions through which foreign investors may acquire de facto control over domestic enterprises that raise \u201cnational security\u201d concerns are subject to strict review by the MOFCOM, and the rules prohibit any activities attempting to bypass a security review, including by structuring the transaction through a proxy or contractual control arrangement. In the future, we may grow our business by acquiring complementary businesses. Complying with the requirements of the above-mentioned regulations and other relevant rules to complete such transactions could be time consuming, and any required approval processes, including obtaining approval from the MOFCOM or its local counterparts may delay or inhibit our ability to complete such transactions, which could affect our ability to expand our business or maintain our market share.\nGovernmental control of currency conversion may affect the value of business in China.\nThe PRC government imposes controls on the convertibility of the RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of foreign currency out of China. Certain revenues may be received in RMB. Shortages in the availability of foreign currency may restrict our or our partners\u2019 ability in China to remit sufficient foreign currency to pay dividends or other payments, or otherwise satisfy their foreign currency-denominated obligations. Under existing PRC foreign exchange regulations, payments of current account items, including profit distributions, interest payments, expenditures from trade related transactions and services-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (\u201cSAFE\u201d) by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from SAFE or its local branch is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of loans denominated in foreign currencies. The PRC government may also at its discretion restrict access to foreign currencies for current account transactions in the future.\nFluctuations in exchange rates of the RMB could materially affect financial results.\nThe exchange rates between the RMB and the U.S. dollars and other foreign currencies are affected by, among other things, changes in China\u2019s political and economic conditions. The People\u2019s Bank of China regularly intervenes in the foreign exchange market to limit fluctuations in RMB exchange rates and achieve policy goals.\nRegulation and censorship of information disseminated over the Internet in China may adversely affect our business, and may cause liability for content that is displayed on any of its websites.\nChina has enacted laws and regulations governing Internet access and the distribution of products, services, news, information, audio-video programs and other content through the Internet. In the past, the PRC government has prohibited the distribution of information through the Internet that it deems to be in violation of PRC laws and regulations. If any of Intermediate\u2019s Internet information on its online platforms is deemed by the PRC government to violate any content restrictions, we or our partners may not be able to continue to display such content and could become subject to penalties, including confiscation of income, fines, suspension of business and revocation of required licenses, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We or our partners may also be subjected to liability for any unlawful actions of their customers or users of their websites or for content distributed by such subsidiaries or partners that is deemed inappropriate. It may be difficult to determine the type of content that may result in liability.\nIt may be difficult for overseas regulators to conduct investigation or collect evidence within China.\nShareholder claims or regulatory investigation that are common in the United States generally are difficult to pursue as a matter of law or practicality in China. For example, in China, there are significant legal and other obstacles to providing information needed for regulatory investigations or litigation initiated outside China. Although the authorities in China may establish a regulatory cooperation mechanism with the securities regulatory authorities of another country or region to implement cross-border supervision and administration, such cooperation with the securities regulatory authorities in the Unities States may not be efficient in the absence of mutual and practical cooperation mechanism. Furthermore, according to Article 177 of the PRC Securities Law, or Article 177, which became effective in March 2020, no overseas securities regulator is allowed to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within the territory of the PRC. While detailed interpretation of or implementation rules under Article 177 have yet to be promulgated, the inability for an overseas securities regulator to directly conduct investigation or evidence collection activities within China may further increase difficulties faced by you in protecting your interests.\nUnder the enterprise income tax (\u201cEIT\u201d) Law, we may be classified as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d of China. Such classification would likely result in unfavorable tax consequences.\nUnder the EIT Law, which has been revised effective as of December 29, 2018, and its implementation rules, (the \u201cImplementation Rules\u201d), which has been revised and effective as April 23, 2019, an enterprise established outside of the PRC with \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d within the PRC is considered a resident enterprise and is subject to enterprise income tax, or EIT, at the rate of 25% on its global income. The Implementation Rules define the term \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d as \u201cestablishments that carry out substantial and overall management and control over the manufacturing and business operations, personnel, accounting, properties, etc. of an enterprise.\u201d The State Administration of Taxation issued the Notice Regarding the Determination of Chinese-Controlled Offshore Incorporated Enterprises as PRC Tax Resident Enterprises on the Basis of De Facto Management Bodies, or Circular 82, on April 22, 2009. Circular 82 provides that a foreign enterprise controlled by a PRC company or a PRC company group will be classified as a \u201cresident enterprise\u201d with its \u201cde facto management bodies\u201d located within China if the following criteria are satisfied: (i) the place where the senior management and core management departments that are in charge of its daily operations perform their duties is mainly located in the PRC; (ii) its financial and human resources decisions are made by or are subject to approval by persons or bodies in the PRC; (iii) its major assets, accounting books, company seals, and minutes and files of its board and shareholders\u2019 meetings are located or kept in the PRC; and (iv) more than half of the enterprise\u2019s directors or senior management with voting rights frequently reside in the PRC.\nCurrently, we do not believe we meet all of the criteria above. If the PRC authorities consider that we meet all of the criteria above and treat us as a resident enterprise, a 25% EIT on global income could significantly increase our tax burden and materially and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, even if we are not deemed as a resident enterprise by the PRC authorities, pursuant to the EIT Law, dividends generated after January 1, 2008 and payable by a foreign-invested enterprise in China to its foreign investors will be subject to a 10% withholding tax, unless any such foreign investor\u2019s jurisdiction of incorporation has a tax treaty with China that provides for a different withholding arrangement and provided that relevant tax authorities approved the foreign investors as the beneficial owners of such dividends under applicable tax regulations.\nWe face uncertainty with respect to indirect transfers of equity interests in PRC resident enterprises by non-PRC holding companies.\nOn February 3, 2015, the China State Administration of Taxation (\u201cSAT\u201d) issued the Circular on issues of enterprise Income Tax on Indirect Transfer of Assets by Non-PRC Resident Enterprise, or the SAT Circular 7, pursuant to which if a non-resident enterprise transfers the equity interests of a PRC resident enterprise indirectly by transfer of the equity interests of an offshore holding company (other than the purchase and sale of shares in public securities market) without a reasonable commercial purpose, the PRC tax authorities have the power to reassess the nature of the transaction and the indirect equity transfer might be treated as a direct transfer. As a result, the gain derived from such transfer, which means the equity transfer price minus the cost of equity, will be subject to the PRC withholding tax at a rate of up to 10%. SAT Circular 7 also brings challenges to both foreign transferor and transferee (or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer) of taxable assets. Under the SAT Circular 7, the transfer which meets all of the following circumstances shall be deemed as having no reasonable commercial purpose: (i) over 75% of the value of the equity interests of the offshore holding company are directly or indirectly derived from PRC taxable properties; (ii) at any time during the year before the indirect transfer, over 90% of the total properties of the offshore holding company are investments within PRC territory, or in the year before the indirect transfer, over 90% of the offshore holding company\u2019s total income is directly or indirectly derived from within PRC territory; (iii) the function performed and risks assumed by the offshore holding company are insufficient to substantiate its corporate existence; or (iv) the foreign income tax imposed on the indirect transfer is lower than the PRC tax imposed on the direct transfer of the PRC taxable properties. In October 2017, SAT issued the Announcement of the State Administration of Taxation on Issues Concerning the Withholding of Non-resident Enterprise Income Tax at Source, or SAT Circular 37, which came into effect on December 1, 2017 and was amended on June 15, 2018. The SAT Circular 37 further clarifies the practice and procedure of the withholding of nonresident enterprise income tax. Where a non-resident enterprise transfers taxable assets indirectly by disposing of the equity interests of an overseas holding company, which is an indirect transfer, the non-resident enterprise as either transferor or transferee, or the PRC entity that directly owns the taxable assets, may report such indirect transfer to the relevant tax authority. Using a \u201csubstance over form\u201d principle, the PRC tax authority may disregard the existence of the overseas holding company if it lacks a reasonable commercial purpose and was established for the purpose of reducing, avoiding or deferring PRC tax.\nWe face uncertainties as to the reporting and other implications of certain past and future transactions that involve PRC taxable assets, such as offshore restructuring, sale of the shares in our offshore subsidiaries and investments. We may be subject to filing obligations or taxed if we are transferors in such transactions, and may be subject to withholding obligations if we are transferees in such transactions, under SAT Circular 7 or SAT Circular 37, or both.\nThe enforcement of the PRC Labor Contract Law and other labor-related regulations in the PRC may adversely affect MICT\u2019s business and results of operations.\nThe Standing Committee of the National People\u2019s Congress enacted the Labor Contract Law in 2008 and amended it on December 28, 2012. The Labor Contract Law introduced specific provisions related to fixed-term employment contracts, part-time employment, probationary periods, consultation with labor unions and employee assemblies, employment without a written contract, dismissal of employees, severance, and collective bargaining to enhance previous PRC labor laws. Under the Labor Contract Law, an employer is obligated to sign an unlimited-term labor contract with any employee who has worked for the employer for ten consecutive years. Further, if an employee requests or agrees to renew a fixed-term labor contract that has already been entered into twice consecutively, the resulting contract, with certain exceptions, must have an unlimited term, subject to certain exceptions. With certain exceptions, an employer must pay severance to an employee where a labor contract is terminated or expires. In the case of retrenching 20 or more employees or where the number of employees to be retrenched is less than 20 but comprises 10% or more of the total number of employees of such employer under certain circumstances, the employer shall explain the situation to the labor union or all staff 30 days in advance and seek the opinion of the labor union or the employees, the employer may carry out the retrenchment exercise upon reporting the retrenchment scheme to the labor administrative authorities. In addition, the PRC governmental authorities have continued to introduce various new labor-related regulations since the effectiveness of the Labor Contract Law.\nUnder the PRC Social Insurance Law and the Administrative Measures on Housing Fund, employees are required to participate in pension insurance, work-related injury insurance, medical insurance, unemployment insurance, maternity insurance, and housing funds and employers are required, together with their employees or separately, to pay the social insurance premiums and housing funds for their employees. If we fail to make adequate social insurance and housing fund contributions, or fail to withhold individual income tax adequately, we may be subject to fines and legal sanctions, and our business, financial conditions and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThese laws designed to enhance labor protection tend to increase our labor costs. In addition, as the interpretation and implementation of these regulations are still evolving, our employment practices may not be at all times be deemed in compliance with the regulations. As a result, we could be subject to penalties or incur significant liabilities in connection with labor disputes or investigations.\nPRC regulations relating to investments in offshore companies by PRC residents may subject our PRC-resident beneficial owners or our PRC subsidiaries to liability or penalties, limit our ability to inject capital into our PRC subsidiaries or limit our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to increase their registered capital or distribute profits.\nSAFE promulgated the SAFE Circular 37 on July 4, 2014, which replaced the former circular commonly known as \u201cSAFE Circular 75\u201d promulgated by SAFE on October 21, 2005. SAFE Circular 37 and its implementing rules require PRC residents to register with banks designated by local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct establishment or indirect control of an offshore entity, for the purpose of overseas investment and financing, with the PRC residents\u2019 legally owned assets or equity interests in domestic enterprises or offshore assets or interests, referred to in SAFE Circular 37 as a \u201cspecial purpose vehicle.\u201d\nWe notified substantial beneficial owners of ordinary shares who we know are PRC residents of their filing obligation, and pursuant to the former SAFE Circular 75, we filed the above-mentioned foreign exchange registration on behalf of certain employee shareholders who we know are PRC residents. However, we may not be aware of the identities of all of our beneficial owners who are PRC residents. We do not have control over our beneficial owners, and there can be no assurance that all of our PRC-resident beneficial owners will comply with relevant SAFE regulations. The failure of our beneficial owners who are PRC residents to register or amend their SAFE registrations in a timely manner or the failure of future beneficial owners of our company who are PRC residents to comply with the registration procedures set forth in SAFE Circular 37 and subsequent implementation rules, may subject the beneficial owners or our PRC subsidiaries to fines and legal sanctions.\nFurthermore, since it is unclear how those SAFE regulations, and any future regulation concerning offshore or cross-border transactions, will be further interpreted, amended and implemented by the relevant PRC government authorities, we cannot predict how these regulations will affect our business operations or future strategy. Failure to register or comply with relevant requirements may also limit our ability to contribute additional capital to our PRC subsidiaries and limit our PRC subsidiaries\u2019 ability to distribute dividends to our company. These risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure to comply with PRC regulations regarding our employee equity incentive plans may subject the PRC participants in the plans, us or our overseas and PRC subsidiaries to fines and other legal or administrative sanctions.\nPursuant to SAFE Circular 37, PRC residents who participate in share incentive plans in overseas non-publicly-listed companies may, prior to the exercise of an option, submit applications to SAFE or its local branches for the foreign exchange registration with respect to offshore special purpose companies. In the meantime, our directors, executive officers and other employees who are PRC citizens or who are non-PRC citizens residing in the PRC for a continuous period of not less than one year, subject to limited exceptions, and whom we or our overseas listed subsidiaries have granted restricted share units, or RSUs, options or restricted shares, may follow the Notice on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plan of Overseas Publicly Listed Company, issued by SAFE in February 2012, to apply for the foreign exchange registration. According to those regulations, employees, directors and other management members participating in any stock incentive plan of an overseas publicly listed company who are PRC citizens or who are non-PRC citizens residing in China for a continuous period of not less than one year, subject to limited exceptions, are required to register with SAFE through a domestic qualified agent, which may be a PRC subsidiary of the overseas listed company, and complete certain other procedures. Failure to complete the SAFE registrations may subject them to fines and legal sanctions and may also limit their ability to make payment under the relevant equity incentive plans or receive dividends or sales proceeds related thereto in foreign currencies, or our ability to contribute additional capital into our domestic subsidiaries in China and limit our domestic subsidiaries\u2019 ability to distribute dividends to us. We also face regulatory uncertainties under PRC law that could restrict our ability or the ability of our overseas listed subsidiaries to adopt additional equity incentive plans for our directors and employees who are PRC citizens or who are non-PRC citizens residing in the PRC for a continuous period of not less than one year, subject to limited exceptions.\nIn addition, the STA has issued circulars concerning employee RSUs, share options or restricted shares. Under these circulars, employees working in the PRC whose RSUs or restricted shares vest, or who exercise share options, will be subject to PRC individual income tax. The PRC subsidiaries of an overseas listed company have obligations to file documents related to employee RSUs, share options or restricted shares with relevant tax authorities and to withhold individual income taxes of those employees related to their RSUs, share options or restricted shares. Although we and our overseas listed subsidiaries currently withhold individual income tax from our PRC employees in connection with the vesting of their RSUs and restricted shares and their exercise of options, if the employees fail to pay, or the PRC subsidiaries fail to withhold, their individual income taxes according to relevant laws, rules and regulations, the PRC subsidiaries may face sanctions imposed by the tax authorities.\nIf our auditor is sanctioned or otherwise penalized by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\u201cPCAOB\u201d) or the SEC as a result of failure to comply with inspection or investigation requirements, our financial statements could be determined to be not in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act or other laws or rules in the United States, which could ultimately result in our Common Stock being delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nOur auditor Friedman LLP is not subject to the December 16, 2021 determination of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (\u201cHFCAA\u201d)and Friedman LLP is being inspected by PCAOB on a regular basis. Our auditor is located in USA and has been inspected and continues to be subject to PCAOB inspection. However, without approval from the Chinese government authorities, the PCAOB is currently unable to conduct inspections of the audit work and practices of PCAOB-registered audit firms within the PRC on a basis comparable to other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Since we have substantial operations in the PRC, if we utilize the services of our auditor\u2019s China based firm or various other auditors located in China, such auditors and their audit work are currently not fully inspected by the PCAOB.\nInspections of other auditors conducted by the PCAOB outside of China have at times identified deficiencies in those auditors\u2019 audit procedures and quality control procedures, which may be addressed as part of the inspection process to improve future audit quality. The inability of the PCAOB to conduct full inspections of auditors in China makes it more difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our auditor\u2019s audit procedures or quality control procedures as compared to auditors outside of China that are subject to PCAOB inspections.\nThe SEC previously instituted proceedings against mainland Chinese affiliates of the numerous accounting firms, including the affiliate of our auditor, for failing to produce audit work papers under Section 106 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act because of restrictions under PRC law. Each of the \u201cbig four\u201d accounting firms in mainland China agreed to a censure and to pay a fine to the SEC to settle the dispute and stay the proceedings for four years, until the proceedings were deemed dismissed with prejudice on February 6, 2019. It remains unclear whether the SEC will commence a new administrative proceeding against the four mainland China-based accounting firms. Any such new proceedings or similar action against our audit firm for failure to provide access to audit work papers could result in the imposition of penalties, such as suspension of our auditor\u2019s ability to practice before the SEC. If our independent registered public accounting firm, or its affiliate, was denied, even temporarily, the ability to practice before the SEC, and it was determined that our financial statements or audit reports were not in compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, we could be at risk of delisting or become subject to other penalties that would adversely affect our ability to remain listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIn recent years, U.S. regulators have continued to express their concerns about challenges in their oversight of financial statement audits of U.S.-listed companies with significant operations in China. More recently, as part of increased regulatory focus in the U.S. on access to audit information, on May 20, 2020, the U.S. Senate passed the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or the HFCA Act, which includes requirements for the SEC to identify issuers whose audit reports are prepared by auditors that the PCAOB is unable to inspect or investigate completely because of a restriction imposed by a non-U.S. authority in the auditor\u2019s local jurisdiction. While we understand that there has been dialogue among the CSRC, the SEC and the PCAOB regarding the inspection of PCAOB-registered accounting firms in China, there can be no assurance that our auditor or us will be able to comply with requirements imposed by U.S. regulators.\nFurthermore, on June 4, 2020, the U.S. President issued a memorandum ordering the President\u2019s Working Group on Financial Markets to submit a report to the President within 60 days of the memorandum that includes recommendations for actions that can be taken by the executive branch, the SEC, the PCAOB or other federal agencies and departments with respect to Chinese companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges and their audit firms, in an effort to protect investors in the United States. The recommendations are to include actions that could be taken under current laws and rules as well as possible new rulemaking recommendations.\nOn May 20, 2020, the HFCAA passed the United States Senate by unanimous consent. On December 2, 2020, the US House of Representatives passed by voice vote the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA), which would require auditors of foreign public companies to allow the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to inspect their audit work papers for audits of non-US operations as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley). If a company\u2019s auditors fail to comply for three consecutive years, then the Company\u2019s shares would be prohibited from trading in the United States. The legislation passed the Senate in May. The HFCAA was signed into law on December 18, 2020. Furthermore, on June 22, 2021. the U.S. Senate passed. and the US house of representative on February 4, 2022 passed the Accelerating Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (the \u201cAHFCAA\u201d), which, if signed into law, would amend the HFCAA and require the SEC to prohibit an issuer\u2019s securities from trading on any U.S. stock exchanges if its auditor is not subject to PCAOB inspections for two consecutive years instead of three consecutive years.\nThe HFCAA aims to address restrictions China has placed on the PCAOB\u2019s ability to inspect or investigate PCAOB-registered public accounting firms in connection with their audits of Chinese companies. Sarbanes-Oxley created the PCAOB \u201cto oversee the audit of public companies that are subject to the securities laws, and related matters, in order to protect the interests of investors and further the public interest in the preparation of informative, accurate, and independent audit reports for companies the securities of which are sold to, and held by and for, public investors.\u201d Specifically, the PCAOB is responsible for registering public accounting firms, establishing standards applicable to the preparation of audit reports for companies, conducting inspections and investigations of public accounting firms to ensure they are complying with those standards, and bringing enforcement actions when they are not.\nThe HFCAA could adversely affect the listing and compliance status of China-based issuers listed in the United States, such as our company, and may have a material and adverse impact on the trading prices of the securities of such issuers, including our Common Stock, and substantially reduce or effectively terminate the trading of our Common Stock in the United States.\nRisk Factors Related to our insurance business\nResults in our insurance brokerage segment may be adversely affected by a general decline in economic activity.\nDemand for many types of insurance and reinsurance generally rises or falls as economic growth expands or slows. This is especially the case with our automobile insurance which is dependent upon the ability of persons to own and operate an automobile. This dynamic affects the level of commissions and fees generated by our VIEs. To the extent our customers become adversely affected by declining business conditions, they may choose to limit their purchases of insurance and reinsurance coverage, as applicable, which would inhibit our ability to generate commission revenue and other revenue based on premiums placed by us. Also, the insurance they seek to obtain through us may be impacted by changes in their assets, property values, sales or number of employees, which may reduce our commission revenue, and they may decide not to purchase our risk advisory or other services, which would inhibit our ability to generate fee revenue. Moreover, insolvencies and combinations associated with an economic downturn, especially insolvencies and combinations in the insurance industry, could adversely affect our brokerage business through the loss of customers or by limiting our ability to place insurance and reinsurance business, as well as our revenues from insurers. We are especially susceptible to this risk given the limited number of insurance company clients and reinsurers in the marketplace.\nVolatility or declines in premiums and other market trends may significantly impede our ability to grow revenues and profitability.\nA significant portion of our insurance brokerage revenue consists of commissions paid to us out of the premiums that insurers and reinsurers charge our clients for coverage. We do not determine the insurance premiums on which our commissions are generally based. Our revenues and profitability are subject to change to the extent that premium rates fluctuate or trend in a particular direction. The potential for changes in premium rates is significant, due to the normal cycles of pricing in the commercial insurance and reinsurance markets.\nAs traditional insurance companies continue to rely on non-affiliated brokers or agents to generate premium, those insurance companies may seek to reduce their expenses by lowering their commission rates. The reduction of these commission rates, along with general volatility or declines in premiums, may significantly affect our revenue and profitability. Because we do not determine the timing or extent of premium pricing changes, it is difficult to accurately forecast our commission revenues, including whether they will significantly decline. As a result, we may have to adjust our plans for future acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividend payments, loan repayments and other expenditures to account for unexpected changes in revenues, and any decreases in premium rates may adversely affect the results of our operations.\nIn addition to movements in premium rates, our ability to generate premium-based commission revenue may be challenged by disintermediation and the growing availability of alternative methods for clients to meet their risk-protection needs. This trend includes a greater willingness on the part of corporations to self-insure, the use of captive insurers, and the presence of capital markets-based solutions for traditional insurance and reinsurance needs. Further, the profitability of our insurance brokerage segment depends in part on our ability to be compensated for the analytical services and other advice that we provide, including the consulting and analytics services that we provide to insurers. If we are unable to achieve and maintain adequate billing rates for all of our services, our margins and profitability could decline. Furthermore, the insurance business in China where we operate is maturing and developing and if we do not compete efficiently and keep current with the trends in the market, our business may decline.\nOur business may be harmed by any negative developments that may occur in the insurance industry or if we fail to maintain good relationships with insurance carriers.\nOur businesses are heavily dependent on the insurance industry. Any negative developments that occur in the insurance industry may have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations. In addition, if we fail to maintain good relationships with insurance carriers, it may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The termination, amendment or consolidation of our relationships with our insurance carriers could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe could incur significant liability or our reputation could be damaged if our information systems are breached or we otherwise fail to protect customer or Company data or information systems.\nIn operating our business and providing services and solutions to customers, we collect, use, store, transmit and otherwise process certain electronic information, including personal, confidential, proprietary and sensitive data such as information related to financial records, health care and personal data of our customers, colleagues and vendors. We rely on the efficient, uninterrupted and secure operation of complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business and securely process, transmit and store electronic information. In the normal course of business, we also share electronic information with our vendors and other third parties. This electronic information comprises sensitive and confidential data, including information related to financial records, health care and customers\u2019 personal data. Our information technology systems and safety control systems, and those of our numerous third-party providers, as well as the control systems of critical infrastructure they rely on are potentially vulnerable to unauthorized access, damage or interruption from a variety of external threats, including cyberattacks, computer viruses and other malware, ransomware and other types of data and systems-related modes of attack. Our systems are also subject to compromise from internal threats such as improper action by employees, vendors and other third parties with otherwise legitimate access to our systems. We could experience significant financial and reputational harm if our information systems are breached, sensitive customer or our data are compromised, surreptitiously modified, rendered inaccessible for any period of time or maliciously made public, or if we fail to make adequate or timely disclosures to the public or law enforcement agencies following any such event, whether due to delayed discovery or a failure to follow existing protocols.\nCyberattacks are increasing in frequency and evolving in nature. We are at risk of attack by a variety of adversaries, including state-sponsored organizations, organized crime, hackers, through use of increasingly sophisticated methods of attack. In particular, we are at increased risk of a cyberattack when geopolitical tensions are high, as diplomatic events and economic policies may trigger espionage or retaliatory cyber incidents. In addition, remote work arrangements in response to COVID-19 have increased the risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks or unauthorized dissemination of personal, confidential, proprietary or sensitive data.\nOur information systems must be continually updated, patched, and upgraded to protect against known vulnerabilities. The volume of new software vulnerabilities has increased markedly, as has the criticality of patches and other remedial measures. In addition to remediating newly identified vulnerabilities, previously identified vulnerabilities must also be continuously addressed. Accordingly, we are at risk that cyberattacks exploit these known vulnerabilities before they have been communicated by vendors or addressed. Any failure related to these activities could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have numerous vendors and other third parties who receive personal information from us in connection with the services we offer our customers. We also use tens of IT vendors and software providers to maintain and secure our global information systems infrastructure. In addition, we have migrated certain data, and may increasingly migrate data, to the cloud hosted by third-party providers. Some of these vendors and third parties also have direct access to our systems. We are at risk of a cyberattack involving a vendor or other third party, which could result in a breakdown of such third party\u2019s data protection processes or the cyberattacks gaining access to our infrastructure through a supply chain attack.\nWe have a history of making acquisitions and investments within the insurance market. The process of integrating the information systems of any businesses we acquire is complex and exposes us to additional risk. For instance, we may not adequately identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities in an acquired entity\u2019s information systems, either before or after the acquisition, which could affect the value we are able to derive from the acquisition, expose us to unexpected liabilities or make our own systems more vulnerable to a cyberattack. In addition, if we discover a historical compromise, security breach or other cyber incident related to the target\u2019s information systems following the close of the acquisition, we may be liable and exposed to significant costs and other unforeseen liabilities. We may also be unable to integrate the systems of the businesses we acquire into our environment in a timely manner, which could further increase these risks until such integration takes place.\nThe costs to comply with, or our failure to comply with laws related to privacy, data security and data protection could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and our reputation.\nImproper collection, use disclosure, cross border transfer, and retention of confidential, personal, or proprietary data could result in regulatory scrutiny, legal and financial liability, or harm to our reputation. In operating our business and providing services and solutions to clients, we store and transfer sensitive employee and client data, including personal data, in and across multiple jurisdictions. We collect data from client and individuals located all over the world and leverage systems and teams to process it. As a result, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, data security and cyber-security. These laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing. Some of these laws and regulations are increasing the level of data handling restrictions, including rules on data localization, all of which could affect our operations and result in regulatory liability and high fines. In particular, high-profile security breaches at major companies continue to be disclosed regularly, which is leading to even greater regulatory scrutiny and fines at the highest levels they have ever been.\nThe scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting. Given the breadth and depth of changes in data protection obligations, including classifying data and committing to a range of administrative, technical and physical controls to protect data, our compliance with laws will continue to require time, resources and review of the technology and systems we use.\nWe expect competition in the Chinese insurance industry to increase, which may materially and adversely affect the growth of our business.\nWe face competitive pressures from both domestic and foreign-invested insurance brokerage companies operating in China, which may compete with our insurance businesses, and other financial institutions that sell other financial investment products in competition with ours. If we are not able to adapt to these increasingly competitive pressures in the future, our growth rate may decline, which could materially and adversely affect our earnings.\nFurther development of regulations in China may impose additional costs or restrictions on our activities.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry. The CBIRC supervises and administers the insurance industry in China. In exercising its authority, it is given certain discretion to administer the law. China\u2019s insurance regulatory regime is undergoing significant changes toward a more transparent regulatory process and a convergent movement toward international standards. Some of these changes may result in additional costs or restrictions on our activities. For example, in November 2020, the Insurance Association of China issued a notice on revising the definition of critical illnesses, including revisions to the applicable scope and principles of critical illnesses as well as relevant provisions on insurance clauses for critical illnesses. From February 1, 2021, insurers may not continue to sell critical illness insurance products which were developed based on previous rules. The CBIRC in the same month also issued a notice stipulating that Critical Illness Morbidity Table in the Chinese Personal Insurance Industry (2020) promulgated by the China Association of Actuaries will serve as the evaluation table and pricing reference table for statutory liability reserve of life insurance products that include critical illness insurance liability. The notice also imposed restrictions on the applicable scope, evaluation of statutory reserves and pricing of the products. These new requirements apply to a number of key products sold by us. Although these new requirements are consistent with our long-term development strategy, making adjustments to relevant products during a short period of time may increase our operating costs and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, because the terms of our products are subject to regulations, changes in regulations may affect our profitability on the policies and contracts we issue.\nAny actions by the Chinese government, including any decision to influence our operations or to exert more oversight and control over any offering of securities conducted overseas and/or foreign investment in China-based issuers, may cause us to make material changes to our operations and could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to offer or continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.\nThe Chinese government has exercised and continues to exercise significant oversight and regulation over almost every sector of the Chinese economy, including the insurance industry, and has discretion over many aspects in which it exercises such authority. Our operations are subject to various regulatory requirements. The Chinese government may also impose new and stricter regulations or impose new interpretations of existing regulations and take other actions that may influence our operations. These government actions, including changes in laws and regulations, particularly those relating to insurance, overseas listing, taxation, land use rights, foreign investment limitations, may result in a material change in our operations and the value of our securities.\nOn December 24, 2021, CSRC published proposed tightening rules governing Chinese companies listing abroad, which require an offshore IPO application to be filed with the CSRC. The proposed rules reflect the continued efforts and plan of the Chinese government to scrutinize and exert more oversight and control over capital market activities including offshore listings. We believe that we are currently not required to file with or obtain permissions from the CSRC to maintain our listing in U.S., but the CSRC or any other PRC regulatory authorities may issue any laws or rules that would require us to file with or obtain approvals from the CSRC or other governmental agencies, and may also take actions imposing restrictions on our continued listing in the U.S. Any such actions could significantly limit or completely hinder our ability to continue to offer securities to investors and cause the value of such securities to significantly decline or be worthless.\nOur insurance business is exposed to various catastrophic events in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year.\nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes, have the potential to adversely affect our operating results. Other risks, such as man-made catastrophes or pandemic disease, could also adversely affect our business and operating results to the extent they are covered by our insurance products. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses.\nCatastrophic events, and any relevant regulations, could result in losses in any business in which we operate, and could expose us to:\n\u25cf widespread claim costs associated with property, workers\u2019 compensation, accident and health, travel, business interruption and mortality and morbidity claims;\n\u25cf loss resulting from a decline in the value of our invested assets;\n\u25cf limitations on our ability to recover deferred tax assets;\n\u25cf loss resulting from actual policy experience that is adverse compared to the assumptions made in product pricing;\n\u25cf revenue loss due to decline in customer base;\n\u25cf declines in value and/or losses with respect to companies and other entities whose securities we hold and counterparties we transact business with and have credit exposure to, including insurers and reinsurers; and\n\u25cf significant disruptions to our physical infrastructure, systems and operations.\nCatastrophes will require us to pay out on many insurance claims including weather related natural disasters. The possibilities that the insurance companies that we write policies for cannot pay for the insurance claim could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity and we may be held liable for the unpaid insurance claims.\nRisks Related to Our Corporate Structure\nIf the PRC government deems that the VIE Agreements do not comply with PRC regulatory restrictions on foreign investment in the relevant industries or other laws or regulations of the PRC, or if these regulations or the interpretation of existing regulations change in the future, we could be subject to severe penalties or be forced to relinquish our interests in those operations, which may therefore materially reduce the value of our ordinary shares.\nWe are a holding company. As a holding company with no material operations of our own, we conduct a substantial majority of our operations through our VIEs in the PRC. We receive the economic benefits of our VIE\u2019s business operations through certain contractual arrangements; however, our rights under the VIEs Agreements do not provide us with an equity interest in our VIEs and is not the same as actual ownership.\nOur PRC subsidiary has entered into the VIE Agreements with our consolidated VIEs and their shareholders, which enable us to (i) exercise effective control over the consolidated VIE, (ii) receive substantially all of the economic benefits of the consolidated VIEs, and (iii) have an exclusive option to purchase all or part of the equity interests and assets in the consolidated VIEs when and to the extent permitted by PRC law. As a result of these contractual arrangements, we have control over and are the primary beneficiary of the consolidated VIE and hence consolidate its financial results as our consolidated VIE under U.S. GAAP.\nWe believe that our corporate structure and contractual arrangements comply with the current applicable PRC laws and regulations. Our PRC legal counsel, Global Law Office, based on its understanding of the relevant laws and regulations, is of the opinion that each of the contracts among our wholly-owned PRC subsidiary, our consolidated VIE and its shareholders is valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms. However, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation and application of current and future PRC laws and regulations. Thus, the PRC governmental authorities may take a view contrary to the opinion of our PRC legal counsel. It is uncertain whether any new PRC laws or regulations relating to variable interest entity structure will be adopted or if adopted, what they would provide. PRC laws and regulations governing the validity of these contractual arrangements are uncertain and the relevant government authorities have broad discretion in interpreting these laws and regulations.\nIf our corporate structure and contractual arrangements are deemed by the relevant regulators that have competent authority, to be illegal, either in whole or in part, we may lose control of our consolidated VIEs, which holds significant assets and accounts for significant revenue, and has to modify such structure to comply with regulatory requirements. However, there can be no assurance that we can achieve this without material disruption to our business. Further, if our corporate structure and contractual arrangements are found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations, the relevant regulatory authorities would have broad discretion in dealing with such violations, including:\n\u25cf revoking our business and operating licenses;\n\u25cf levying fines on us;\n\u25cf confiscating any of our income that they deem to be obtained through illegal operations;\n\u25cf shutting down our services;\n\u25cf discontinuing or restricting our operations in China;\n\u25cf imposing conditions or requirements with which we may not be able to comply;\n\u25cf requiring us to change our corporate structure and contractual arrangements;\n\u25cf restricting or prohibiting our use of the proceeds from overseas offering to finance our consolidated VIE\u2019s business and operations; and\n\u25cf taking other regulatory or enforcement actions that could be harmful to our business.\nFurthermore, new PRC laws, rules and regulations may be introduced to impose additional requirements that may be applicable to our corporate structure and contractual arrangements. Occurrence of any of these events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our ordinary shares. In addition, if the imposition of any of these penalties or requirement to restructure our corporate structure causes us to lose the rights to direct the activities of our consolidated VIE or our right to receive their economic benefits, we would no longer be able to consolidate the financial results of such VIE in our consolidated financial statements, which may cause the value of our securities to significantly decline or even become worthless. However, we do not believe that such actions would result in the liquidation or dissolution of our company, our wholly-owned subsidiary in China or our consolidated VIE.\nOur current corporate structure and business operations and the market price of our ordinary shares may be affected by the newly enacted Foreign Investment Law which does not explicitly classify whether VIE that are controlled through contractual arrangements would be deemed as foreign-invested enterprises if they are ultimately \u201ccontrolled\u201d by foreign investors.\nThe VIE structure has been adopted by many Chinese-based companies, including us, to obtain necessary licenses and permits in the industries that are currently subject to foreign investment restrictions in China. On March 15, 2019, the National People\u2019s Congress, China\u2019s national legislative body (the \u201cNPC\u201d) approved the Foreign Investment Law, which took effect on January 1, 2020. On December 26, 2019, the PRC State Council approved the Implementation Rules of the Foreign Investment Law, which came into effect on January 1, 2020. Since they are relatively new, uncertainties exist in relation to their interpretation. The Foreign Investment Law does not explicitly classify whether variable interest entities that are controlled through contractual arrangements would be deemed as foreign-invested enterprises if they are ultimately \u201ccontrolled\u201d by foreign investors. However, it has a catch-all provision under definition of \u201cforeign investment\u201d that includes investments made by foreign investors in China through other means as provided by laws, administrative regulations or the State Council. Therefore, it still leaves leeway for future laws, administrative regulations or provisions of the State Council to provide for contractual arrangements being viewed as a form of foreign investment. Therefore, there can be no assurance that our control over our consolidated VIE through contractual arrangements will not be deemed as foreign investment in the future.\nFurthermore, if future laws, administrative regulations or provisions mandate further actions to be taken by companies with respect to existing contractual arrangements, we may face substantial uncertainties as to whether we can complete such actions in a timely manner, or at all. Failure to take timely and appropriate measures to cope with any of these or similar regulatory compliance challenges could materially and adversely affect our current corporate structure and business operations and the market price of our ordinary shares.\nWe conduct a significant portion of our operations through our VIEs, which is established in the PRC, and we rely on contractual arrangements with our consolidated VIEs and its shareholders to operate our business, which may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing operational control and otherwise have a material adverse effect as to our business.\nWe rely on contractual arrangements with our consolidated VIEs and its shareholders. A substantial majority of our revenue is generated by and a significant percentage of our consolidated assets are owned by the VIEs, whose financial statements are consolidated with ours. These contractual arrangements do not give us an equity interest in the VIEs and may not be as effective as direct ownership in providing us with control over our consolidated VIEs. If our consolidated VIEs or its shareholders fail to perform their respective obligations under these contractual arrangements, our recourse to the assets held by our consolidated VIEs is indirect and we may have to incur substantial costs and expend significant resources to enforce such arrangements in reliance on legal remedies under PRC law. These remedies may not always be effective, particularly in light of uncertainties in the PRC legal system. Furthermore, in connection with litigation, arbitration or other judicial or dispute resolution proceedings, assets under the name of any of record holder of equity interest in our consolidated VIEs, including such equity interest, may be put under court custody. As a consequence, we cannot be certain that the equity interest will be disposed pursuant to the contractual arrangement or ownership by the record holder of the equity interest.\nAll of these contractual arrangements are governed by PRC law and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in the PRC. Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with PRC laws and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures. The legal environment in the PRC is not as developed as in other jurisdictions, such as the U.S. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system could limit our ability to enforce these contractual arrangements. In the event that we are unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, or if we suffer significant time delays or other obstacles in the process of enforcing these contractual arrangements, it would be very difficult to exert effective control over our consolidated VIEs, and our ability to conduct our business and our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nAny failure by our consolidated VIEs or its shareholders to perform their contractual obligations would have a material adverse effect on our business and the market price of our ordinary shares.\nOur wholly foreign-owned enterprise in the PRC, has entered into the VIEs Agreements with our consolidated VIEs and its shareholders. If our consolidated VIEs or its shareholders fail to perform their respective obligations under these contractual arrangements, we may incur substantial costs and expend additional resources seeking to enforce such arrangements. We may also have to rely on legal remedies under PRC laws, including seeking specific performance or injunctive relief, and claiming damages, which we cannot assure you will be effective under PRC laws. For example, if the shareholders of our consolidated VIEs were to refuse to transfer their equity interests in the consolidated VIEs to our WFOE or its designee when our WFOE exercises the purchase option pursuant to these contractual arrangements, or if the shareholders of the VIEs were otherwise to act in bad faith toward MICT or our WFOE, then our WFOE may have to take legal actions to compel them to perform their contractual obligations.\nAll of the VIEs Agreements are governed by PRC laws and provide for the resolution of disputes through arbitration in China. Accordingly, these contracts would be interpreted in accordance with PRC laws and any disputes would be resolved in accordance with PRC legal procedures, but an arbitration proceeding is not as formal as a court proceeding and the arbitrator may apply PRC law in a manner different from a court. The legal system in the PRC is not as developed as in some other jurisdictions, such as the U.S., and the arbitrator may render a decision which is in conflict with our understanding of the laws of the PRC and we may have little if any recourse. As a result, uncertainties in the PRC legal system and the arbitration procedure could limit the ability of our WFOE to enforce these contractual arrangements. Meanwhile, there are very few precedents and formal guidelines as to how contractual arrangements in the context of a VIEs should be interpreted or enforced under PRC laws. There remain significant uncertainties regarding the ultimate outcome of such arbitration should it become necessary. In addition, under PRC laws, rulings by arbitrators are final and parties cannot appeal arbitration results in court unless such rulings are revoked or determined unenforceable by a competent court. If the losing parties fail to carry out the arbitration awards within a prescribed time limit, the prevailing parties may only enforce the arbitration awards in PRC courts through arbitration award recognition proceedings, which would require additional expenses and delay. In the event that our WFOE is unable to enforce these contractual arrangements, or if our WFOE suffers significant delay or other obstacles in the process of enforcing these contractual arrangements, MICT may not be able to exert effective control over our consolidated VIEs, in which event we may lose the value of the VIEs Agreements and the relevant rights and licenses held by the VIEs which MICT requires in order to operate its business, and its ability to conduct its business may be negatively affected. Any delay in effecting enforcement of our WFOE\u2019s rights under the VIEs Agreements could materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial condition, the results of our operations, our prospects, our ability to continue in business and the market for and market price of our ordinary shares. If our WFOE is not able to enforce its rights, we may not be able to include the VIE\u2019sfinancial statements with MICT, which could cause our ordinary shares to lose most, if not all, of their value.\nThe arbitration provisions under the VIEs Agreements have no effect on the rights of our shareholders to pursue claims against us under the United States federal securities laws, although any such actions would have no effect on our WFOE\u2019s ability to enforce its rights under the VIEs Agreements.\nThe shareholders of our consolidated VIEs may have potential conflicts of interest with us, which may materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition and the value of our ordinary shares.\nThe interests of the shareholders of our consolidated VIEs in their capacities as such shareholders may differ from the interests of our company as a whole, as what is in the best interests of our consolidated VIEs, including matters such as whether to distribute dividends or to make other distributions to fund our offshore requirement to the extent that such funding is permitted under PRC laws, may not be in our best interests. There can be no assurance that when conflicts of interest arise, any or all of these shareholders will act in our best interests of or that any conflicts of interest will be resolved in our favor. In addition, these shareholders may breach or cause our consolidated VIEs and its subsidiaries to breach or refuse to renew the existing contractual arrangements with us.\nOur WFOE, however, could, at all times, exercise its option under the exclusive option agreement to cause the VIEs shareholders to transfer all of their equity ownership in our consolidated VIEs to a PRC entity or individual designated by our WFOE as permitted by the then applicable PRC laws. In addition, if such conflicts of interest arise, our WFOE could also, in the capacity of attorney-in-fact of the shareholders of our consolidated VIEs as provided under the power of attorney, directly appoint new directors of our consolidated VIEs. We rely on the shareholders of our consolidated VIEs to comply with PRC laws and regulations, which protect contracts and provide that directors and executive officers owe a duty of loyalty to our company and require them to avoid conflicts of interest and not to take advantage of their positions for personal gains, and the laws of the Cayman Islands, which provide that directors have a duty of care and a duty to act honestly in good faith with a view to our best interests. However, the legal frameworks of both China and the Cayman Islands do not provide guidelines on resolving conflicts with other corporate governance regimes. If our WFOE cannot resolve any conflicts of interest or disputes between our WFOE and the shareholders of our consolidated VIEs, MICT would have to rely on the arbitration provisions of the VIEs Agreements, which, as discussed in the previous risk factor, could result in the disruption of our business and subject us to substantial uncertainty as to the outcome of any such. As a result, in the event that the shareholders of the VIEs do not comply with their obligations under the VIEs Agreements, our WFOE may not be able to enforce its rights, in which event we may not be able to include the VIEs financial statements with MICT\u2019s which could cause our ordinary shares to lose most, if not all, of their value.\nContractual arrangements in relation to our consolidated VIEs may be subject to scrutiny by the PRC tax authorities who may determine that our consolidated VIEs owes additional taxes, which could negatively affect our financial condition and the value of your investment.\nUnder applicable PRC laws and regulations, arrangements and transactions among related parties may be subject to audit or challenge by the PRC tax authorities. The PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, requires every enterprise in China to submit its annual enterprise income tax return together with a report on transactions with its related parties to the relevant tax authorities. The tax authorities may impose reasonable adjustments on taxation if they have identified any related party transactions that are inconsistent with the arm\u2019s length principles. We may face material and adverse tax consequences if the PRC tax authorities determine that the contractual arrangements among our wholly-owned PRC subsidiary, our consolidated VIEs and its shareholders were not entered into on an arm\u2019s length basis in such a way as to result in an impermissible reduction in taxes under applicable PRC laws, regulations and rules, and adjust their income in the form of a transfer pricing adjustment. A transfer pricing adjustment could, among other things, result in a reduction of expense deductions recorded by our wholly-owned PRC subsidiary or consolidated VIEs for PRC tax purposes, which could in turn increase their tax liabilities without reducing their tax expenses. Furthermore, the PRC tax authorities may impose late payment fees and other penalties on our PRC subsidiary and consolidated VIEs for adjusted but unpaid taxes according to applicable regulations. Our financial position could be materially and adversely affected if the tax liabilities of our PRC subsidiary and consolidated VIEs increase, or if they are required to pay late payment fees and other penalties.\nWe may lose the ability to use and enjoy assets held by our consolidated VIEs that are material to the operation of our business if the entity goes bankrupt or becomes subject to a dissolution or liquidation proceeding.\nOur consolidated VIEs holds substantially all of our assets. Under the contractual arrangements, our consolidated VIEs may not and its shareholders may not cause it to, in any manner, sell, transfer, mortgage or dispose of its assets or its legal or beneficial interests in the business without our WFOE\u2019s prior consent. However, in the event that the shareholders of our consolidated VIEs breach these contractual arrangements and voluntarily liquidate our consolidated VIEs, or our consolidated VIEs declares bankruptcy and all or part of its assets become subject to liens or rights of third-party creditors, or are otherwise disposed of without our WFOE\u2019s consent, we may be unable to continue some or all of our business activities, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If our consolidated VIEs undergoes a voluntary or involuntary liquidation proceeding, independent third-party creditors may claim rights to some or all of these assets, thereby hindering our ability to operate our business, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisk Factors Relating to Micronet\u2019s Business and Industry\nPotential political, economic and military instability in Israel could adversely affect operations.\nCertain of MICT and Micronet\u2019s principal offices and operating facilities are located in Israel. Accordingly, with respect to such Israeli facilities, political, economic and military conditions in Israel directly affect the operations of MICT and Micronet. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors. A state of hostility varying in degree and intensity has led to security and economic problems for Israel. Since October 2000, there has been an increase in hostilities between Israel and Palestinians, which has adversely affected the peace process and has negatively influenced Israel\u2019s relationship with its Arab citizens and several Arab countries, including the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Lebanon and Syria. Such ongoing hostilities may hinder Israel\u2019s international trade relations and may limit the geographic markets where Micronet can sell its products and solutions. Hostilities involving or threatening Israel, or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners, could materially and adversely affect operations.\nIn addition, Israel-based companies and companies doing business with Israel have been subject to an economic boycott by members of the Arab League and certain other predominantly Muslim countries since Israel\u2019s establishment, along with other private organizations around the world. Although Israel has entered into various agreements with certain Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority, and various declarations have been signed in connection with efforts to resolve some of the economic and political problems in the Middle East, whether or in what manner these problems will be resolved is unpredictable. Wars and acts of terrorism have resulted in significant damage to the Israeli economy, including reducing the level of foreign and local investment.\nSubstantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights may be incurred, which would have an adverse effect on the value of MICT\u2019s equity interest in Micronet.\nThird parties may challenge the validity of Micronet\u2019s intellectual property rights or bring claims regarding Micronet\u2019s infringement of a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. This may result in costly litigation or other time-consuming and expensive judicial or administrative proceedings, which could deprive Micronet of valuable rights, cause them to incur substantial expenses and cause a diversion for technical and management personnel. An adverse determination may subject Micronet to significant liabilities or require it to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially favorable terms, if at all. Further, if such claims are proven valid, through litigation or otherwise, Micronet may be required to pay substantial financial damages or be required to discontinue or significantly delay the development, marketing, sale or licensing of the affected products and intellectual property rights. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on the value of MICT\u2019s equity interest in Micronet.", "PERMNO": 13879, "SIC": 3812, "TIC": "MICT"}
