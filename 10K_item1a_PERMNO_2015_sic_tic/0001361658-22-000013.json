{"cik": "1361658", "company": "Travel & Leisure Co.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-23", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risk factors and all of the other information set forth in this report. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe that the following information identifies the material risk factors affecting our company. However, the risks and uncertainties we face are not limited to those set forth in the risk factors described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe not to be material risks may also adversely affect our business. In addition, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nWe may not be able to achieve the objectives of our acquisition of the Travel + Leisure brand or the future prospects and plans for Travel + Leisure Co.\nOn January 5, 2021, we acquired the Travel + Leisure brand and all related assets from Meredith Corporation. On February 17, 2021, Wyndham Destinations, Inc. changed its name to Travel + Leisure Co., and began trading under the ticker symbol NYSE: TNL. See Note 5-Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information concerning this acquisition.\nThe expected results of the transaction and the future prospects for, and plans of, our company, including our strategies to accelerate growth of our global businesses by broadening the strength of our cornerstone timeshare and exchange businesses and creating depth of leisure travel products and services through our business extensions, are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control.\nPromotion activities associated with our businesses may not yield increased revenue in the time expected or at all, and, even if revenue does increase, it may not be sufficient to offset the expenses we incur in building our brands. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our businesses and brands, or incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brands, we may fail to attract or retain customers to the extent necessary to realize a sufficient return with respect to the acquisition and our rebranding efforts, which would adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, a portion of the value associated with the Travel + Leisure brand is derived from the long-standing commitment to high-quality, independent travel journalism by Travel + Leisure magazine and associated media properties, which continue to be operated by Meredith outside of our control. If the quality or reach of such media properties deteriorates in the future, it could negatively impact the perception of the Travel + Leisure brand and adversely impact our business.\nThe timeshare industry is highly competitive and we are subject to risks related to competition that may adversely affect our performance.\nWe will be adversely impacted if we cannot compete effectively in the highly competitive timeshare industry. The continued success and future growth of our timeshare and exchange businesses, depends upon our ability to compete effectively in markets that contain numerous competitors, some of which may have significantly greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we have. We principally compete with short-term vacation options such as lodging, cruise, and home and apartment sharing services, as well as other timeshare developers. We compete based on brand name recognition and reputation, lifetime value, location, convenience, quality accommodations, service levels, amenities, and flexibility. In order to compete, we incent potential new owners and existing owners to tour with us to better understand our products and services. New resorts may be constructed and these additions to supply may create new competitors, in some cases without corresponding increases in demand. Competition may reduce fee structures, potentially causing us to lower our fees or prices, which may adversely impact our profits. New competition or existing competition that uses a business model that is different from our business model may require us to change our model so that we can remain competitive.\nOur RCI exchange business depends on vacation ownership developers for new members and existing members and participants to renew their memberships and engage in exchange and non-exchange transactions. Our new owner enrollment volumes dropped significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the industry wide drop in VOI sales to new owners. Although new owner sales levels have recovered from their lows in 2020, they have not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels and there is no assurance that they will recover in the timeframe or at the levels that we expect. Developers and members also supply resort accommodations for use in exchanges. If we are unable to negotiate new affiliation agreements with resort developers or secure renewals with existing members or developers in our RCI network, the number of new and/or existing members, the supply of resort accommodations available through our exchange networks and related revenue will decrease. The failure to secure the renewal of affiliation agreements with developers that have corporate member relationships, where the developer renews RCI membership fees for all of its active owners, has a greater adverse effect. The loss or renegotiation on less favorable terms of several of our largest affiliation agreements could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to maintain affiliate agreements with resort developers is also impacted by consolidation in the vacation ownership industry. For example, in connection with the acquisition of Welk Hospitality Group, Inc. (\u201cWelk\u201d) by Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation, the RCI contract with Welk was terminated. Consolidation can also lead to larger competitors with greater resources that compete with our vacation ownership business for customers, projects, and talent.\nOur new business extensions operate in a highly competitive global environment and may take longer than expected to achieve the levels of revenues, customer acceptance and profitability we expect.\nAs we continue to expand our business into the broader leisure travel industry, we will be adversely impacted if we cannot compete effectively. There are a great number of existing competitive travel services, some of which have significantly greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we have, and while the market is currently fragmented, existing travel service companies as well as new entrants may adversely impact our ability to achieve the level of revenues, transactions, and profitability we expect.\nOur Travel + Leisure Group\u2019s subscription business is largely dependent on the success of our direct-to-consumer marketing efforts and the willingness of consumers to subscribe to the Travel + Leisure Club for access to preferred travel pricing,\nexclusive experiences and customized concierge services. Our Panorama Travel Solutions business is largely dependent on the success of marketing efforts to closed user groups through partner brands and the subsequent propensity of the members of those groups to use the platform for their travel bookings and upgrade to receive premium services. Both businesses are also reliant on our ability to leverage new and existing relationships with travel suppliers, including hotels, airlines, rental car companies, and wholesale suppliers, and their willingness to distribute products and services through our platforms. There is no assurance that these efforts will be successful within the timeframe or at the levels we expect.\nWe will also need to regularly update our technology infrastructure to continually changing conditions, needs, and advancements, which may not at all times occur in the time or in the manner needed to achieve our desired results.\nWhile many of our activities in establishing and implementing each of these business extensions are using our existing expertise, resources and technologies, these subscription business extensions can be expected to require us to utilize and augment resources, including management and other personnel, beyond those required by our historic business offerings and, as a result, subject us to greater risks and uncertainties than historically considered for our core timeshare and exchange businesses.\nFailure to maintain the integrity of internal or customer data or to protect our systems from cyber-attacks could disrupt our business, damage our reputation, and subject us to costs, fines or lawsuits.\nIn connection with our business, we and our service providers collect and retain large volumes of certain types of personal and proprietary information pertaining to our guests, shareholders and employees. Such information includes, but is not limited to, large volumes of guest credit and payment card information, guest travel documents, other identification documents, account numbers, and other personally identifiable information. We are subject to attack by cyber-criminals operating on a global basis attempting to gain access to such information, and the integrity and protection of that guest, shareholder, and employee data is critical to us.\nWhile we maintain what we believe are reasonable security controls over personal and proprietary information, including the personal information of guests, shareholders, and employees, any breach of or breakdown in our systems that results in the theft, loss, fraudulent use or other unauthorized release of personal, confidential or other proprietary information or other data could nevertheless occur and persist for an extended period of time without detection, which could have a material adverse effect on our brands, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as subject us to significant regulatory actions and fines, litigation, losses, third-party damages and other liabilities. Such a breach or a breakdown could also materially increase our costs to protect such information and to protect against such risks. Our and our third-party service providers\u2019 vulnerability to attack exists in relation to known and unknown threats. As a consequence, the security measures we deploy are not perfect or impenetrable, and we may be unable to anticipate or prevent all unauthorized access attempts made on our systems or those of our third-party service providers.\nData breaches, viruses, ransomware and other serious cyber incidents have increased globally, along with the methods, techniques and complexity of attacks. We have been, and likely will continue to be, subject to such cyber-attacks. Also, the same cyber security issues exist for the third parties with whom we interact and share information, and cyber-attacks on third parties which possess or use our customer, personnel and other information could adversely impact us in the same way as would a direct cyber-attack on us.\nWhile we have not incurred any material adverse impact on our operations or financial results as a result of a cyber-attack, there is no guarantee that cyber-attacks have not gone generally undetected or without general recognition of magnitude or will not occur in the future, any of which could materially adversely affect our brands, reputation, costs and profitability.\nAdditionally, the legal and regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy in the U.S. and international jurisdictions is constantly evolving. For example, in the U.S., California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA provides to California consumers certain new access, deletion and opt-out rights related to their personal information, imposes civil penalties for violations and affords, in certain cases, a private right of action for data breaches. The CCPA was amended in November 2020 with passage of the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d) ballot initiative, adding further consumer rights and compliance obligations. Complying with the CCPA has increased our compliance cost and compliance with additional provisions of CCPA and CPRA that will take effect in 2023 could increase these costs further. Similar legislation has been proposed or adopted in other states (for example, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act that is also going into effect in 2023). Aspects of the CCPA and these other state laws and regulations, as well as their enforcement, remain unclear, and we may be required to modify our practices in an effort to comply with them. Moreover, foreign data protection, privacy, consumer protection, content regulation and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive or burdensome than those in the United States. For example, the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d)\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) imposes significant obligations to businesses that sell products or services to E.U. customers or otherwise control or process personal data of E.U. residents. Complying with GDPR caused us to update certain business practices and systems and incur costs related to continued compliance with GDPR and other international laws and regulations. In addition, should we violate or not comply with the CCPA, GDPR or any other applicable laws or regulations, contractual requirements relating to data security and privacy, or with our own privacy and security policies, either intentionally or unintentionally, or through the acts of intermediaries, it could have a material adverse effect on our brands, marketing, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as subject us to significant fines, litigation, losses, third-party damages and other liabilities.\nOur information technology infrastructure, including but not limited to our, and our third-party service providers\u2019, information systems and legacy proprietary online reservation and management systems, has been and will likely continue to be vulnerable to system failures such as server malfunction or software or hardware failures, computer hacking, phishing attacks, user error, cyber-terrorism, loss of data, computer viruses, ransomware and malware installation, and other intentional or unintentional interference, negligence, fraud, misuse and other unauthorized attempts to access or interfere with these systems and our personal and proprietary information. In addition, as we continue to transition from our legacy systems to new, cloud-based technologies, we may continue to face start-up issues that may negatively impact guests. The increased scope and complexity of our information technology infrastructure and systems could contribute to the risk of future material security breaches or breakdowns, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, brands, reputation and results of operations.\nAcquisitions, dispositions and other strategic transactions may not prove successful and could result in operating difficulties.\nWe regularly consider a wide array of acquisitions and other potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of businesses and real property, joint ventures, business combinations, strategic investments and dispositions. Any of these transactions could be material to our business. We often compete for these opportunities with third parties, which may cause us to lose potential opportunities or to pay more than we may otherwise have paid absent such competition. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify and consummate strategic transactions and opportunities on favorable terms or that any such strategic transactions or opportunities, if consummated, will be successful. Assimilating any strategic transactions may also create unforeseen operating difficulties and costs.\nOn May 9, 2018, we completed the sale of our European vacation rentals business and, on October 22, 2019, we completed the sale of our North American vacation rentals business. Dispositions of businesses, such as our European and North American vacation rentals transactions, pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business, including costs or disputes with buyers. Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement, as we may be required to retain responsibility for, or agree to indemnify buyers against, credit support obligations, contingent liabilities related to a divested business, such as lawsuits, tax liabilities, or other matters. Under these types of arrangements, performance by the divested business or other conditions outside of our control could affect our financial condition or results of operations. See Note 29-Transactions with Former Parent and Former Subsidiaries to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our obligations related to the European vacation rentals business and the North American vacation rentals business and Note 7-Held-for-Sale Business to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the North American vacation rentals transaction.\nOn August 7, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Alliance Reservations Network, a company that provides private-label travel booking technology solutions, and on January 5, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the Travel + Leisure brand of Meredith. Acquisitions of businesses, such as the ARN transaction, could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and/or the assumption of contingent liabilities. See Note 5-Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the consideration paid in connection with these acquisitions.\nAcquisitions may also be structured in such a way that we will be assuming unknown or undisclosed liabilities or obligations or we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following the acquisition, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, reductions in personnel, unexpected penalties or enforcement actions, and other liabilities. Moreover, we may be unable to efficiently integrate acquisitions, management attention and other resources may be diverted away from other potentially more profitable areas of our business and in some cases these acquisitions may turn out to be less compatible with our growth and operational strategy than originally anticipated. The success of our acquisitions is also subject to other risks, including, among others:\n\u2022failure to realize expected technological and product synergies, economies of scale and cost reductions;\n\u2022unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions related to the acquisitions, including those due to regulations;\n\u2022adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers, partners, employees or suppliers;\n\u2022risks associated with entering into markets in which we have limited or no prior experience, including less visibility into demand;\n\u2022inaccurate assumptions regarding the acquired business or integration process;\n\u2022financial and operational results that may differ materially from our assumptions and forecasts;\n\u2022unforeseen difficulties that may arise in integrating operations, processes and systems;\n\u2022higher than expected investments that may be required to implement necessary compliance processes and related systems, including information technology systems, accounting systems and internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022failure to retain, motivate and integrate any key management and other employees of the acquired business;\n\u2022higher than expected costs or other impacts resulting from unforeseen changes in tax, trade, environmental or other regulations in jurisdictions in which the acquired business conducts its operations; and\n\u2022issues with retaining customers and integrating customer bases.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and diversion of management\u2019s time and attention. Furthermore, we may not realize the degree or timing of benefits we anticipate when we first enter into these transactions. Failure to successfully execute these transactions and integrate acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur revenues are highly dependent on the health of the travel industry and declines in or disruptions to the travel industry such as those caused by economic conditions, terrorism or acts of gun violence, political strife, severe weather events and other natural disasters, war, and pandemics may adversely affect us.\nDeclines in or disruptions to the travel industry have in the past adversely impacted us and any future declines or disruptions are also likely to adversely impact us. Risks affecting the travel industry can be localized events or global in nature and include: economic slowdown and recession; economic factors such as increased costs of living and reduced discretionary income adversely impacting decisions by consumers to use and consume travel services and products; terrorist incidents and threats and associated heightened travel security measures; acts of gun violence or threats thereof; political and regional strife; natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods and volcano eruptions; war; concerns with, and increased governmental regulations in response to, pandemics, contagious diseases or health epidemics such as the continuing COVID-19 pandemic; environmental disasters; lengthy power outages; increased pricing, financial instability and capacity constraints of air carriers; airline job actions and strikes; and increases in gasoline and other fuel prices.\nThere has also been public discussion that climate change is associated with extreme weather conditions and other natural disasters, such as increased frequency and severity of storms and floods, coastal erosion and flooding due to higher sea levels, increased temperatures, increased forest fires, and other factors that may adversely impact the accessibility or desirability of travel to certain locations. Additionally, increased regulations related to climate change could have an adverse impact on the leisure travel industry generally.\nAny of the foregoing disruptions would likely adversely affect our affiliated resorts, our RCI affiliates and other developers of vacation ownership resorts and timeshare property owner associations, and our new business extensions, thereby impacting our operations and the trading price of our common stock. Further, Travel + Leisure Co. develops and manages resort properties throughout the world, a portion of which are in areas with greater exposure to the adverse effects of severe weather events and other natural disasters associated with climate change due to their location in coastal areas or states where wildfires are common, which could cause such resorts to suffer greater adverse effects from those events than the leisure travel industry faces in general.\nFor risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see \u201cRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic.\u201d\nWe are subject to numerous business, financial, operating and other risks common to the travel industry, including timeshare, any of which could reduce our revenues and our ability to make distributions and limit opportunities for growth.\nOur business is subject to numerous business, financial, operating and other risks common to the travel industry, including adverse changes with respect to any of the following:\n\u2022consumer travel and vacation patterns and consumer preferences;\n\u2022increased or unanticipated operating costs, including as a result of inflation;\n\u2022energy costs, labor shortages, including such shortages as have occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, and labor costs such as minimum wage increases and unionization, workers' compensation and health-care related costs and insurance which may not be fully offset by price or fee increases in our business or otherwise;\n\u2022product and supply chain disruptions, such as have occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022desirability of geographic regions where resorts in or affiliated with our businesses are located;\n\u2022the supply and demand for vacation ownership products and services, exchange services and products, and travel subscription services and products;\n\u2022seasonality in our businesses, which may cause fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022geographic concentrations of our operations and customers;\n\u2022the availability of acceptable financing and the cost of capital as they apply to us, our customers, our RCI affiliates and other developers of vacation ownership resorts and timeshare property owner associations;\n\u2022the quality of the services provided by affiliated resorts and properties in our exchange business or resorts in which we sell VOIs or by participants in the Wyndham Rewards loyalty program, which may adversely affect our image, reputation and brand value;\n\u2022overbuilding or excess capacity in one or more segments of the timeshare industry or in one or more geographic regions;\n\u2022our ability to conduct tours of our properties and generate new owners, both of which were significantly reduced during the continuance of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022our ability to accurately plan for or estimate future timeshare inventory needs, which was adversely impacted by the effect of COVID-19 on vacation ownership tours and VOI sales, and balance our supply of new and existing timeshare properties with consumer demand for those properties;\n\u2022success of any actions we may take in seeking to increase our vacation ownership contract receivables portfolio, which was adversely impacted by the effect of COVID-19 on vacation ownership tours and VOI sales;\n\u2022success of any actions we may take to increase our exchange membership levels, which were adversely impacted by the effect of COVID-19 on VOI sales;\n\u2022our ability to develop and maintain positive relations and contractual arrangements with VOI owners, current and potential vacation exchange members, resorts with units that are exchanged through our exchange business and timeshare property owner associations;\n\u2022organized labor activities and associated litigation;\n\u2022the bankruptcy or insolvency of customers or other adverse economic factors impacting the financial health of customers, which has impaired and could continue to impair our ability to collect outstanding fees or other amounts due or otherwise exercise our contractual rights;\n\u2022our effectiveness in keeping pace with technological developments, including with respect to social media platforms, as well as any failure to upgrade our technology infrastructure to meet changing customer interfacing needs, which could impair our competitive position;\n\u2022our ability to grow the membership base of our businesses;\n\u2022our ability to offer acceptable customer pricing for products and services;\n\u2022our ability to identify and obtain industry specific talent (including digital, sales, marketing, and operational leadership skills) to execute our growth strategy;\n\u2022disruptions, including non-renewal or termination of agreements, in relationships with third parties including marketing alliances and affiliations with e-commerce channels;\n\u2022owners or other developers that have development advance notes with us, or who have received loans or other financial arrangements incentives from us, who have experienced and may continue to experience financial difficulties;\n\u2022consolidation of developers could adversely affect our exchange business;\n\u2022decrease in the supply of available exchange accommodations due to, among other reasons, a decrease in inventory included in the system or resulting from ongoing property renovations or a decrease in member deposits could adversely affect our exchange business;\n\u2022decrease in or delays or cancellations of planned or future development or refurbishment projects, such as have occurred during the continuance of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the viability of property owners' associations that we manage and the maintenance and refurbishment of vacation ownership properties, which depend on property owners associations levying sufficient maintenance fees and the ability of members to pay such maintenance fees, particularly in times of economic downturn such as caused by the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022impact of existing or future inflation;\n\u2022increases in maintenance fees, which could cause our product to become less attractive or less competitive;\n\u2022our ability to securitize the receivables that we originate in connection with sales of VOIs;\n\u2022defaults or delinquencies on loans to purchasers of VOIs who finance the purchase price of such vacation ownerships, which generally increase in times of economic downturn such as during the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the level of unlawful or deceptive third-party VOI resale schemes, which could damage our reputation and brand value;\n\u2022the availability of and competition for desirable sites for the development of vacation ownership properties, difficulties associated with obtaining required approvals to develop vacation ownership properties, liability under state and local laws with respect to any construction defects in the vacation ownership properties we develop, and risks related to real estate project development costs and completion;\n\u2022private resale of VOIs and the sale of VOIs on the secondary market, which could adversely affect our vacation ownership resorts and exchange business;\n\u2022disputes with owners of VOIs, property owners associations, and vacation exchange affiliation partners, which may result in litigation and the loss of management contracts;\n\u2022laws, regulations and legislation internationally and domestically, and on a federal, state or local level, concerning the leisure travel industry, which may make the operation of our business more onerous, more expensive or less profitable;\n\u2022our failure or inability to adequately protect and maintain our trademarks and other intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022market perception of the timeshare industry and negative publicity from online social media postings and related media reports, which could damage our brands.\nAny of these factors could increase our costs, reduce our revenues or otherwise adversely impact our opportunities for growth.\nThird-party Internet reservation systems and peer-to-peer online networks may adversely impact us.\nConsumers increasingly use third-party internet travel intermediaries and peer-to-peer online networks to search for and book their lodging accommodations. As the percentage of internet reservations increases, travel intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions and reduced room rates from us to the detriment of our business. Additionally, such travel intermediaries may divert reservations away from our direct online channels or increase the overall cost of internet reservations for our affiliated resorts through their fees. As the use of these third-party reservation channels and peer-to-peer online networks increases, consumers may rely on these channels, adversely affecting our vacation ownership and vacation exchange brands, travel subscription businesses, reservation systems, bookings and rates.\nWe are subject to risks related to our vacation ownership receivables portfolio.\nWe are subject to risks that purchasers of VOIs who finance a portion of the purchase price default or otherwise delay payments on their loans due to adverse macro or personal economic conditions, third-party organizations that encourage defaults, or otherwise, which necessitates increases in loan loss reserves and adversely affects loan portfolio performance. When such defaults or delinquencies occur during the early part of the loan amortization period, we may not have recovered the marketing, selling, administrative and other costs associated with such VOIs. Additional costs are incurred in connection with the resale of repossessed VOIs, and the value we recover in a resale is not in all instances sufficient to cover the outstanding debt on the defaulted loan.\nDuring 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we initiated a program permitting our owners to defer payment on their receivables to us in order to provide financial assistance to these owners during a period of unprecedented economic insecurity. While a majority of owners who participated in this deferral program resumed normal payments to us, financial difficulties of owners and customers arising from the continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in increased payment defaults and delinquencies both during the continuation of, and following, the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAlso during 2020, in response to COVID-19, we substantially increased our loan loss allowance on our vacation ownership receivables portfolio. In the future, we could have to increase our loan loss allowance above average historic levels again, whether due to COVID-19 or other unexpected causes.\nOur international operations are subject to additional risks not generally applicable to our domestic operations.\nOur international operations are subject to numerous risks, including exposure to local economic conditions; potential adverse changes in the diplomatic relations of foreign countries with the U.S.; hostility from local populations; political instability; threats or acts of war, hostilities, or terrorism; the effect of disruptions caused by severe weather, natural disasters, outbreak of disease or other events that make travel to a particular region less attractive or more difficult; the presence and acceptance of varying levels of business corruption in international markets and the effect of various anti-corruption and other laws; restrictions and taxes on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings; government policies against businesses or properties owned by non-U.S. citizens; investment restrictions or requirements; diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights in foreign countries; forced nationalization of assets by local, state or national governments; foreign exchange restrictions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; conflicts between local laws and U.S. laws including laws that impact our rights to protect our intellectual property; withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries; and changes in and application of foreign taxation structures including value added taxes. Any of these risks or any adverse outcome resulting from the financial instability or performance of foreign economies, the instability of other currencies\nand the related volatility on foreign exchange and interest rates, could impact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nChanges in U.S. federal, state and local or foreign tax law, interpretations of existing tax law, or adverse determinations by tax authorities, could increase our tax burden or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxation at the federal, state and local levels in the U.S. and various other countries and jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rate and future cash flows could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, changes in statutory rates and other legislative changes, including as a result of the change in the U.S. presidential administration, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in determinations regarding the jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax, and our ability to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, U.S. federal, state and local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and their application, and which are being contemplated in the U.S. and certain other countries, and which could result in materially higher corporate taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law and could otherwise adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to ongoing and periodic tax audits and disputes in U.S. federal and various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. An unfavorable outcome from any tax audit could result in higher tax costs, penalties and interest, thereby adversely affecting our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain risks related to our indebtedness, hedging transactions, securitization of certain of our assets, surety bond requirements, the cost and availability of capital and the extension of credit by us.\nWe are a borrower of funds under credit facilities, credit lines, senior notes, and term loan and securitization financings. We use financial instruments to reduce or hedge our financial exposure to the effects of currency and interest rate fluctuations from time to time. We are required to post surety bonds in connection with our development and sales activities. In connection with our debt obligations, hedging transactions, securitization of certain of our assets, surety bond requirements, the cost and availability of capital and the extension of credit by us, we are subject to numerous risks, including:\n\u2022our cash flows from operations or available lines of credit may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, which could result in a default and acceleration of the underlying debt and other debt instruments that contain cross-default provisions;\n\u2022we may be unable to comply with the terms of the financial covenants under our revolving credit facility or other debt agreements, including a breach of the financial ratio tests, which could result in a default and acceleration of the underlying revolver debt and under other debt instruments that contain cross-default provisions;\n\u2022our leverage may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all;\n\u2022our leverage may require the dedication of a significant portion of our cash flows to the payment of principal and interest thus reducing the availability of cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases or other operating needs;\n\u2022negative ratings and/or downgrades of our debt by rating agencies could increase our borrowing costs and prevent us from obtaining additional financing on favorable terms or at all, such as when during the second quarter of 2020, Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Inc. downgraded our secured debt rating from Ba2 to Ba3 with a \u201cnegative outlook;\u201d\n\u2022failure or non-performance of counterparties to foreign exchange and interest rate hedging transactions could result in losses;\n\u2022an inability to securitize our vacation ownership loan receivables on terms acceptable to us because of, among other factors, the performance of the vacation ownership loan receivables, adverse conditions in the market for vacation ownership loan-backed notes and asset-backed notes in general, and the risk that the actual amount of uncollectible accounts on our securitized vacation ownership loan receivables and other credit we extend is greater than expected;\n\u2022breach of portfolio performance triggers under securitization transactions which if violated may result in a disruption or loss of cash flow from such transactions;\n\u2022a reduction in commitments from surety bond providers, which may impair our vacation ownership business by requiring us to escrow cash in order to meet regulatory requirements of certain states;\n\u2022prohibitive or increased cost, or inadequate availability, of capital could restrict the development or acquisition of vacation ownership resorts by us and the financing of purchases of VOIs;\n\u2022increases in interest rates, which would increase the cost of our existing variable rate debt and cost of our subsequent fixed rate debt, and which also may prevent us from passing along the full amount of such increases to purchasers of VOIs to whom we provide financing; and\n\u2022increases in interest rates on consumer financing to VOI purchasers could diminish our VOI sales;\n\u2022disruptions in the financial markets, including potential financial uncertainties surrounding the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d and the failure of financial institutions that support our credit facilities, general economic conditions and market liquidity factors outside of our control, which may limit our access to short- and long-term financing, credit and capital.\nChanges in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR rates are determined and phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may affect our financial results.\nThe chief executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), previously announced that the FCA intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In response, the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized the Alternative Reference Rates Committee which identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as its preferred alternative to USD-LIBOR in derivatives and other financial contracts. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, including the pace at which sufficient liquidity in the LIBOR replacement rate markets will develop. During 2021, the LIBOR rate administrator announced its intention to extend publication of LIBOR rates for most USD LIBOR tenors through June 30, 2023.\nIn the transition from the use of LIBOR to SOFR or other alternatives, the level of interest payments we incur under our debt agreements may change. In addition, although certain of our LIBOR based obligations provide for alternative methods of calculating the related interest rate payable (including transition to an alternative benchmark rate) if LIBOR is not reported, uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher than, lower than, or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the interest rates and/or payments that would have been made on our obligations if LIBOR was available in its current form.\nWe are subject to risks related to litigation.\nWe are subject to a number of claims and legal proceedings and the risk of future litigation as described in these Risk Factors and throughout this report and as may be updated in subsequent SEC filings from time to time, including, but not limited to, with respect to Cendant and the Spin-off. See further discussion in Note 20-Commitments and Contingencies and Note 29-Transactions with Former Parent and Former Subsidiaries to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We cannot predict with certainty the ultimate outcome or related damages and costs of litigation and other proceedings filed or asserted by or against us. Unfavorable rulings or outcomes in litigation and other proceedings may harm our business.\nOur operations are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect us.\nOur operations are regulated by federal, state and local governments in the countries in which we operate. In addition, U.S. and international, federal, state and local regulators may enact new laws and regulations that may reduce our revenues, cause our expenses to increase or require us to modify our business practices substantially. If we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including, among others, those governing timeshare (including required government registrations), consumer financings and other lending, information security, data protection and privacy (including the General Data Protection Regulation \u201cGDPR\u201d), credit card and payment card security standards, marketing, sales, consumer protection and advertising, unfair and deceptive trade practices, fraud, bribery and corruption, telemarketing (including do-not-call and call-recording regulations), licensing, labor, employment, anti-discrimination, health care, health and safety, accessibility, immigration, gaming, environmental (including climate change) and remediation, intellectual property, securities, stock exchange listing, accounting, tax and regulations applicable under the Dodd-Frank Act, Office of Foreign Asset Control, Americans with Disabilities Act, the Sherman Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local equivalents in international jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom Bribery Act, we may be subject to regulatory investigations or actions, fines, civil and/or criminal penalties, injunctions and potential criminal prosecution. In the past, when we have been subjected to regulatory investigations, the amount of the fines involved were not material to our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, we cannot predict whether any future fines, penalties or other sanctions that regulators might seek to impose would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe insurance we carry may not always pay, or be sufficient to pay or reimburse us, for our liabilities, losses or replacement costs.\nWe carry insurance for general liability, property, business interruption, cyber security, directors and officers (\u201cD&O\u201d), and other insurable risks with respect to our business operations. We also self-insure for certain risks up to certain monetary limits. The terms and conditions or the amounts of coverage of our insurance may not at all times be sufficient to pay or reimburse us for the amount of our liabilities, losses or replacement costs, and there may also be risks for which we do not obtain insurance\nin the full amount or at all concerning a potential loss or liability, due to the cost or availability of such insurance. As a result, we may incur liabilities or losses in the operation of our business that are substantial which are not sufficiently covered by the insurance we maintain, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Following the significant casualty losses incurred by the insurance industry due to hurricanes, fires, cyber security breaches and other events, property, cyber security and D&O insurance costs have increased and in the future may be higher, and availability may be lower, in future periods, particularly in certain geographies. In addition, the effects of climate change, such as increased storm intensity and rising sea levels, may also increase the cost and decrease the available coverage levels of property insurance.\nWe rely on information technologies and systems to operate our business, which involves reliance on third-party service providers and on uninterrupted operation of service facilities.\nWe rely on information technologies and systems to operate our business, which involves reliance on third-party service providers and on uninterrupted operation of service facilities, including those used for our travel subscription businesses, reservation systems, payments systems, vacation exchange systems, property management, communications, procurement, member record databases, call centers, operation of our loyalty programs and administrative systems. We also maintain physical facilities to support these systems and related services. Any natural disaster, cyberattack, disruption or other impairment in our technology capabilities and service facilities or those of our third-party service providers could result in denial or interruption of service, financial losses, customer claims, litigation or damage to our reputation, or otherwise harm our business and financial results. In addition, any failure of our ability to provide our reservation systems, as a result of failures related to us or our third-party providers, may deter prospective resort owners from entering into agreements with us, and may expose us to liability from other parties with whom we have contracted to provide reservation services. Similarly, failure to keep pace with developments in technology, including continuing upgrades to our technology system which interface with customers, which is a significant part of our business, could impair our operations, financial results and competitive position. Any failure of our business continuity planning as to any of these matters could have a material adverse impact on our business, brand and financial results.\nThe growth of our business and the execution of our business strategies depend on the services of our senior management and our associates.\nWe believe that our business success and future growth depends, in part, on the continued services of our senior management team, including our President and Chief Executive Officer, Michael D. Brown, and on our ability to successfully implement succession plans for members of our senior management team. The loss of any members of our senior management team, or the failure to identify successors for such positions, could adversely affect our strategic growth, new business extensions and customer relationships and impede our ability to execute our business strategies. In addition, insufficient numbers of talented associates could constrain our ability to maintain and expand our business. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel. If we cannot recruit, train, develop or retain sufficient numbers of talented associates, we could experience increased associate turnover, decreased guest satisfaction, low morale, inefficiency, or internal control failures.\nWe are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility.\nMany factors influence our reputation and the value of our brands including the perception held by our customers and other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business. Our business faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance activities and risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our brands if we fail to act responsibly or comply with regulatory requirements in a number of areas, such as business ethics and compliance, safety and security, responsible tourism, public health, environmental stewardship and sustainability, supply chain management, climate change, diversity, human rights and modern slavery, philanthropy and support for local communities.\nWe have publicly stated our goals related to environmental sustainability, which include reducing our water intensity and carbon emissions and increasing our renewable energy consumption. We may also take additional actions related to climate change and environmental sustainability voluntarily or in response to increased regulations in the future that would materially increase the costs to develop and operate our resorts, which could have an adverse impact on our profitability even though such actions may be necessary to increase the long term sustainability of our business.\nCurrent and future international operations expose us to additional challenges and risks that may not be inherent in operating solely in the U.S. due to different social or cultural norms and practices that are not customary in the U.S., distance and language, including, but not limited to, our ability to sell products and services, enforce intellectual property rights and staff and manage operations.\nWe are responsible for certain of Cendant's contingent and other corporate liabilities.\nUnder the separation agreement and the tax sharing agreement that we executed with Cendant (now Avis Budget Group) and former Cendant units, Realogy and Travelport, Wyndham Worldwide Corporation and Realogy generally were responsible for 37.5% and 62.5% of certain of Cendant\u2019s contingent and other corporate liabilities and associated costs including certain contingent and other corporate liabilities of Cendant or its subsidiaries to the extent incurred on or prior to August 23, 2006. As a result of the completion of the Spin-off, Wyndham Hotels agreed to retain one-third of Cendant\u2019s contingent and other corporate liabilities and associated costs; therefore, we are responsible for 25% of these liabilities and costs subsequent to the Spin-off. These liabilities include those relating to certain of Cendant\u2019s terminated or divested businesses, the Travelport sale, certain Cendant-related litigation, actions with respect to the separation plan and payments under certain contracts that were not allocated to any specific party in connection with the separation.\nIf any party responsible for the liabilities described above were to default on its obligations, each non-defaulting party would be required to pay an equal portion of the amounts in default. Accordingly, we could under certain circumstances be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our share of the assumed obligations related to such liabilities including associated costs.\nWe may incur impairment charges related to the fair value of our assets.\nChanges to estimates or projections used to assess the fair value of our assets or operating results that are lower than our current estimates may cause us to incur impairment losses and require us to write-off all or a portion of the remaining value of our goodwill or other intangibles of companies we have acquired.\nOur total assets include goodwill and other intangible assets. We evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or at other times during the year if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value is below the carrying value. We may be required to record a significant non-cash impairment charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill, other intangible assets or other assets is determined, negatively impacting our results of operations and shareholders' equity.\nIn 2020, we recorded $56 million of asset impairment charges, primarily associated with the impact of COVID-19 on our business, $6 million of which was subsequently reversed in 2021. With the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to impact the U.S. and global economy and our business, we cannot assure that these charges will be adequate in response to these unprecedented events or that additional asset impairment charges may not be required in the future related to COVID-19 concerns or events or otherwise.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly negatively affected our operations and may significantly negatively affect our future business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCOVID-19 has led to significant disruptions in the global and U.S. economy, in the leisure travel industry and in our business. The extent and duration of the ongoing negative effects of COVID-19 continues to be impacted by uncertainty as the pandemic continues to evolve. As a result, the economic recovery, the recovery of our business, the market for our common stock and the capital markets generally remain volatile. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Impact of COVID-19 on our Business\u201d for more information.\nIn addition, the increase in the number of our employees working remotely has increased certain risks to our business, including increased demand on our information technology resources and systems, greater potential for phishing and other cybersecurity attacks, and an increase in the number of points of potential attack, and any failure to effectively manage these risks and to timely identify and respond to any cyberattacks may adversely affect our business. The pandemic may also have long-term effects on the nature of the office environment and remote working, which may present operational challenges that could adversely affect our culture and our business. Our corporate associates have been predominately working remotely since March 2020. We plan to reopen our corporate offices in 2022 and adopt a hybrid work environment in which many corporate associates will work both in the office and remotely on an ongoing basis. The re-opening of our offices may not be successful and could expose our personnel to health risks and will involve additional financial burdens.\nThere remains significant uncertainty concerning the current and future impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. and global economy, consumer confidence, the leisure travel industry and our business. Some of these uncertainties and risks include the following:\n\u2022resurgences, continued high rates of infection and hospitalization, and continued high death rates related to COVID-19, including in regions and locations where we have a significant number of resorts;\n\u2022uncertainty regarding the U.S. and global economic impact caused by the continuation of COVID-19;\n\u2022changes in governmental policies, rules and regulations which could change or otherwise impact our safety protocols and measures intended to protect our owners, guests, and team members;\n\u2022continued governmental restrictions on and recommendations and warnings against travel in certain regions, including in or to areas or locations where we have resorts, as well as between the U.S. and other countries, including restrictions placed by foreign governments on U.S. citizens traveling to their countries;\n\u2022continued closures and/or limitations on the number of individuals that may gather in one location at many popular tourist and entertainment center destinations, reducing the demand for leisure travel;\n\u2022our inability to predict the length of time it will take for all of our properties to return to normal operations;\n\u2022leisure travel may take longer to recover than expected, and we may see lower VOI sales or reductions in bookings, even after the risks associated with the pandemic decrease to acceptable levels, due to changing behavior of individuals and decrease in willingness to travel and stay at resorts, timeshares and other lodging facilities or reluctance to engage in discretionary spending or otherwise;\n\u2022whether the steps we have taken, and in the future may continue to take, to reduce our operating costs and improve operating efficiencies, including our ongoing operating cost reductions implemented in 2020, may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain associates, the image of our brands and market share, sales of VOIs, and our near-term and long-term financial results;\n\u2022our virtual tours and tele sales activities increased since the start of the pandemic and may not be as successful as we expect during the continuance of the pandemic or thereafter, and our VOI sales can be expected to be negatively impacted until in-person tours return to normal levels;\n\u2022average number of exchange members in our Travel and Membership segment is down as a result of the pandemic, and we expect this to continue into 2022;\n\u2022we have elected not to reopen certain sales offices which were closed as a result of the pandemic, which may adversely impact VOI sales and exchange memberships;\n\u2022the U.S. has experienced significant labor shortages, which has impacted most industries including the leisure travel industry and our business;\n\u2022unemployment rates increased sharply in 2020 to record high levels as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and, although as of December 31, 2021, unemployment rates had recovered to near pre-pandemic levels, volatility in unemployment may continue to impact consumer confidence and leisure travel generally, and negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022owner defaults, delinquencies and payment delays may increase if the U.S. and global economies and consumer confidence do not rebound to pre-pandemic levels or remain volatile;\n\u2022there is no assurance that, post-pandemic, owner upgrades will return to levels which existed pre-pandemic;\n\u2022our urban resort locations may be slower to recover to pre-pandemic levels than resorts in other locations;\n\u2022potential cases of infection and transmission at our resorts despite the implementation of our safety measure efforts, which would be disruptive and may lead to exposure to assertions of liability; and\n\u2022other actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic that may result in investigations, legal claims (regardless of merit) or litigation against us.\nEach of these uncertainties, risks and events associated with COVID-19 may cause a significantly negative impact on our future business and financial results, and we are unable to predict the full extent or nature of these impacts at this time. While we have made and continue to make efforts to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful, and as a result, our future business, financial condition and results of operations may be significantly negatively impacted. The volatile conditions stemming from COVID-19, as well as reactions to future pandemics or resurgences of COVID-19, could also precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors that we identify in this Item 1A, which in turn could significantly negatively affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) and/or stock price. Further, COVID-19 may affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present material risks to our operations.\nCOVID-19 has impacted and may continue to impact our credit facilities and securitization facilities.\nThe effects of COVID-19 may negatively affect our ability to comply with existing covenants under our debt agreements, increase our cost of capital or make additional capital more difficult to obtain or available only on terms less favorable to us, if at all. In response to the impact of COVID-19 on our business, on July 15, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility and term loan B (the \u201cFirst Amendment\u201d), which among other changes, provided financial covenant flexibility and imposed certain restrictions during a relief period that commenced on July 15, 2020 and was scheduled to end on April 1, 2022 (the \u201cRelief Period\u201d). As a result of improved business conditions, on October 22, 2021, we entered into a second amendment to our credit agreement (the \u201cSecond Amendment\u201d), which among other changes terminated the Relief Period early. See 16-Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. However, the continued impact of COVID-19 on our industry and business may impact our ability to maintain compliance with\nour debt covenants in the future. If we fail to comply with our debt covenants, the lenders under our secured revolving credit facility and term loan B, subject to our right to cure, would have the right to terminate and declare the outstanding loans to be immediately due and payable, and any such default could trigger a cross-default, acceleration or other consequences under other indebtedness or financial instruments to which we are a party.\nCOVID-19 also temporarily impacted the asset-backed securities market in 2020, and thus impacted the cost of issuing asset-backed securities. As of December 31, 2021, we had $698 million of availability under our asset-backed conduit facilities. Any disruption to the asset-backed securities market could negatively impact our ability to obtain asset-backed financings or the terms of such financings. Our liquidity, as it relates to our vacation ownership contract receivables (\u201cVOCRs\u201d) securitization program, could be adversely affected if we were to fail to renew or replace our conduit facilities on their expiration dates, or if a particular receivables pool were to fail to meet certain ratios, which could occur in certain instances if the default rates or other credit metrics of the underlying VOCRs deteriorate as a result of the COVID-19 crisis or otherwise. Our ability to sell securities backed by our VOCRs depends on the continued ability and willingness of capital market participants to invest in such securities, which may be negatively affected by COVID-19 and its impact on economic conditions and the credit of our VOCRs pools.\nWe utilize surety bonds in our vacation ownership business for sales and development transactions in order to meet regulatory requirements of certain states. The availability, terms and conditions and pricing of bonding capacity are dependent on, among other things, continued financial strength and stability of the insurance company affiliates providing the bonding capacity, general availability of such capacity and our corporate credit rating. As a result of COVID-19, we could see a reduction in commitments from our surety providers. Any such reduction in commitments or reduced availability of bonding capacity, or a negative change to the terms and conditions and pricing of the bonding capacity, may negatively impact our vacation ownership business.\nRisks Related to the Spin-Off\nThe Spin-off and related transactions may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements.\nWhile we did receive a solvency opinion from an investment bank confirming that we and Wyndham Hotels were adequately capitalized immediately after the Spin-off, the Spin-off could be challenged under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. An unpaid creditor could claim that we did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the Spin-off, and that the Spin-off left us insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that we intended or believed we would incur debts beyond our ability to pay such debts as they mature. If a court were to agree with such a plaintiff, then such court could void the Spin-off as a fraudulent transfer and could impose a number of different remedies, including without limitation, returning the assets or the shares of common stock in Wyndham Hotels being distributed as part of the Spin-off or providing us with a claim for money damages against the spun-off business in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by Travel + Leisure Co. and the fair market value of Wyndham Hotels at the time of the Spin-off.\nFollowing completion of the Spin-off, our success depends in part on our ongoing relationship with Wyndham Hotels.\nIn connection with the Spin-off, we entered into a number of agreements with Wyndham Hotels that govern the ongoing relationships between Wyndham Hotels and Travel + Leisure Co. following the Spin-off. Our success depends, in part, on the maintenance of these ongoing relationships with Wyndham Hotels as well as Wyndham Hotels\u2019 performance of its obligations under these agreements. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with Wyndham Hotels, or if Wyndham Hotels does not perform its obligations under these agreements, fails to protect the trademarks, trade names and intellectual property that we license from it or if these brands deteriorate or materially change in an adverse manner, or the reputation of these brands declines, our brand may be negatively affected, our profitability and revenues could decrease and our growth potential may be adversely affected. We also have successfully utilized and leveraged our relationship with Wyndham Hotels\u2019 loyalty program and any cessation of or adverse change in that loyalty program could be expected to materially adversely impact our business, growth strategy and financial results.\nWe are responsible for certain contingent and other corporate liabilities incurred prior to the Spin-off.\nIn accordance with the agreements we entered into with Wyndham Hotels in connection with the Spin-off, Wyndham Hotels assumed one-third and Travel + Leisure Co. assumed two-thirds of certain contingent and other corporate liabilities of Wyndham Worldwide incurred prior to the Distribution, including liabilities of Wyndham Worldwide related to certain terminated or divested businesses, certain general corporate matters, and any actions with respect to the separation plan. See Note 29-Transactions with Former Parent and Former Subsidiaries to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our obligations related to Wyndham Hotels.\nIf Wyndham Hotels was to default on its obligations, we would be required to pay the amounts in default. Accordingly, we could under certain circumstances be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our share of the assumed obligations related to such liabilities including associated costs.\nCertain directors who serve on our Board also serve on the board of directors of and own common stock of Wyndham Hotels.\nCertain directors who serve on our Board currently serve as directors of and own shares of common stock of Wyndham Hotels, which may create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest, in particular when our or Wyndham Hotels\u2019 management and directors face decisions that could have different implications for us and Wyndham Hotels, including the resolution of any dispute regarding the terms of the agreements governing the Spin-off and the relationship between us and Wyndham Hotels or any other commercial agreements entered into in the future between Travel + Leisure Co. and Wyndham Hotels.\nIf the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, were to fail to qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code, then our shareholders, we and Wyndham Hotels might be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes.\nIn conjunction with the Distribution, we received opinions of our Spin-off tax advisors to the effect that, subject to the assumptions and limitations described therein, the Distribution, together with certain related transactions, will qualify as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code in which no gain or loss is recognized by us or our shareholders, except, in the case of our shareholders, for cash received in lieu of fractional shares. The opinions of our Spin-off tax advisors were based on and relied on, among other things, certain assumptions as well as on the continuing accuracy of certain factual representations and statements that we and Wyndham Hotels made to the Spin-off tax advisors and certain covenants that Travel + Leisure Co. and Wyndham Hotels entered into, including covenants contained in the Tax Matters Agreement. If any of these representations or statements are or become inaccurate or incomplete, or if Travel + Leisure Co. or Wyndham Hotels breach any of such covenants, the Distribution and such related transactions might not qualify for such tax treatment. The opinions of the Spin-off tax advisors are not binding on the IRS or a court, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the validity of the distribution and such related transactions as a reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code eligible for tax-free treatment, or that any such challenge ultimately will not prevail.\nIn addition, we received a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain U.S. federal income tax aspects of transactions related to the Spin-off (the \u201cIRS Ruling\u201d). Although the IRS Ruling generally is binding on the IRS, the continued validity of the IRS Ruling will be based upon and subject to the continuing accuracy of factual statements and representations made to the IRS by us. The IRS Ruling is limited to specified aspects of the Spin-off under Sections 355 and 361 of the Code and does not represent a determination by the IRS that all of the requirements necessary to obtain tax-free treatment to holders of our common stock and to us have been satisfied.\nIf the Distribution does not qualify as a tax-free transaction for any reason, including as a result of a breach of a representation or covenant, we would recognize a substantial gain attributable to Wyndham Hotels for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such case, under U.S. Treasury regulations, each member of our consolidated group at the time of the Spin-off (including the hotel business) would be jointly and severally liable for the entire resulting amount of any U.S. federal income tax liability. Additionally, if the distribution of the common stock of Wyndham Hotels does not qualify as tax-free under Section 355 of the Code, our shareholders will be treated as having received a taxable distribution equal to the value of the stock distributed, treated as a taxable dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, and then would have a tax-free basis recovery up to the amount of their tax basis in their shares, and then would have taxable gain from the sale or exchange of the shares to the extent of any excess.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our shares of common stock may continue to fluctuate.\nThe trading price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate depending upon many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry; customer acceptance and success of our new business extensions; actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to seasonality and other factors related to our business; our ability or perceived ability to realize the benefits of the Spin-off; our credit ratings, including the impact of the Spin-off and the global COVID-19 pandemic on such ratings; changes in accounting principles or rules; announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions; the lack of securities analysts covering our\ncommon stock; lower than expected earnings or revenues or outlook for such financial measures, changes in earnings or revenues estimates by us or by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates; the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies; overall market fluctuations; and general economic conditions. Stock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and under Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of Travel + Leisure Co. which could impact the trading price of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions include that shareholders do not have the right to act by written consent, rules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings, the right of our Board to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval and limitations on the right of shareholders to remove directors. Delaware law also imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. We believe these provisions protect our shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board and by providing our Board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers. However, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some shareholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board determines is not in the best interests of our company and our shareholders.\nWe cannot provide assurance that we will continue to pay dividends or purchase shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program.\nThere can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash or surplus under Delaware law to be able to continue to pay dividends or purchase shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program. This may result from extraordinary cash expenses, actual expenses exceeding contemplated costs, funding of capital expenditures, increases in reserves or lack of available capital. Our Board may also suspend the payment of dividends or our share repurchase program if the Board deems such action to be in the best interests of our shareholders. During 2020, in response to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, our Board, acting prudently, reduced our dividend and suspended our share repurchase program. While the Relief Period restrictions under our First Amendment on share repurchases and dividend payments was terminated by amendment on October 22, 2021, we cannot assure that our Board may not need to consider limitations, reductions or other restrictions on share repurchases and dividends in the future in response to continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise.", "PERMNO": 91392, "SIC": 6531, "TIC": "WYND"}
