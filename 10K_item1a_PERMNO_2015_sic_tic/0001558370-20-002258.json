{"cik": "1551306", "company": "Progyny, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-10", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the sections titled \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d and Part II, Item 7.\u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe fertility market in which we participate is competitive, and if we do not continue to compete effectively, our results of operations could be harmed.\nThe market for our solutions is competitive and is likely to attract increased competition, which could make it hard for us to succeed. We compete on the basis of several factors, including the comprehensiveness of our benefits solutions and the Smart Cycle (our unique approach to benefits plan design which ensures that members always have coverage for a full treatment cycle as their access to treatment is not limited by a dollar maximum that could be exhausted mid-treatment), superior clinical outcomes, access for all employee groups (including LGBTQ+ and single mothers by choice), equitable access to care across geographies, quality of the member experience and comprehensive member support, access to our selective Center of Excellence (our proprietary, credentialed network of high-quality fertility specialists), data reporting and sharing and access to an integrated pharmacy solution. While we do not believe any single\ncompetitor offers a similarly robust and integrated fertility and family building benefits solution, we compete primarily with health insurance companies and benefits administrators that also provide fertility benefits management services as part of their overall healthcare coverage. These competitors include all conventional health insurers, such as UnitedHealthcare, Cigna, Aetna and members of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. Other competitors that currently provide fertility benefits management services to employers include WIN Fertility and Optum Fertility Solutions. We also compete with benefits managers that are new to the industry that do not have integrated health insurance carrier solutions, such as Carrot Fertility and Maven Clinic, which currently offer employees post-tax reimbursement programs for fertility benefits.\nAs we market our solutions to potential clients that currently utilize other vendors to manage their employees\u2019 fertility benefits, we may fail to convince their internal stakeholders that our offerings and our model are superior to their current solutions. Some of our competitors are more established, benefit from greater brand recognition and have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources. Our competitors may seek to develop or integrate solutions and services that may become more efficient or appealing to our existing and potential clients. For example, fertility-focused pharmacy benefits managers, or PBMs, could emerge that would compete with Progyny Rx. In addition, we believe one of our key competitive advantages is our purpose-built, data-driven platform. While we do not believe any competitors have developed a similarly robust data collection, analysis and reporting process at this time, current or future competitors may be successful in doing so in the future.\nIn addition, we believe that there is growing awareness of the demand for fertility benefits. As the fertility benefits field gains more attention, more competitors may be drawn into the market. We also could be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in market dynamics. As a result of any of these factors, we may not be able to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors, and this competition could result in the failure of our platform to continue to maintain market acceptance, which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a history of operating losses and may not sustain profitability in the future.\nWe experienced net losses from 2015 to 2019. Our net loss from continuing operations was $(8.6) million and $(5.1) million and for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. While we have experienced significant revenue growth since 2016, we are not certain whether we will obtain sufficient levels of sales to sustain our growth or maintain profitability in the future. We also expect our costs and expenses to increase in future periods, which could negatively affect our future results of operations if our revenue does not increase. In particular, we intend to continue to incrementally expand our sales and client account management teams to educate potential clients and drive new client adoption, as well as enhance the scope of Progyny benefits within our existing client base. We also expect to incur additional costs as we introduce new solutions and services to enhance our comprehensive fertility offering. We will also face increased compliance costs associated with growth, the expansion of our client base and being a public company. Our efforts to grow our business may be costlier than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset our increased operating expenses. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including the other risks described herein, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays, and other unknown events. If we are unable to sustain profitability, the value of our business and common stock may significantly decrease.\nWe have a limited operating history with our current platform of solutions, which makes it difficult to predict our future results of operations.\nWe went live with our fertility benefits solution in 2016 and Progyny Rx in 2018. As a result of our limited operating history with the current platform of solutions, as well as a limited amount of time serving a majority of our client base, our ability to accurately forecast our future results of operations is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. Our historical revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance. Further, in future periods, our revenue growth could slow or decline for a number of reasons, including slowing demand for our solutions and fertility benefits in general, change in utilization trends by our members, general economic slowdown, an increase in unemployment, an increase in competition, changes to health care trends and regulations, changes to science relating to the fertility market, a decrease in the growth of the fertility market, or our failure, for any reason, to continue to take advantage of growth opportunities. If our assumptions regarding these\nrisks and uncertainties and our future revenue growth are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations, and our business could suffer.\nIf we are unable to attract new clients, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nTo increase our revenue, we must continue to attract new clients. Our ability to do so depends in large part on the success of our sales and marketing efforts, and the success of attracting industry leaders in diversified sectors, which could prompt others in the same sectors to follow suit to remain competitive. Potential clients may seek out other options; therefore, we must demonstrate that our solutions are valuable and superior to alternatives. If we fail to provide high-quality solutions and convince clients of the benefits of our model and value proposition, we may not be able to attract new clients. The market for our solutions could decline or grow more slowly than we expect due to general economic conditions, outbreaks of contagious diseases, a decrease in business investments, including spending on employee benefits, and other factors. If the markets for our solutions decline or grow more slowly than we expect, or if the number of clients that contract with us for our solutions declines or fails to increase as we expect, our financial results could be harmed. As the markets in which we participate mature, fertility solutions and services evolve and competitors begin to enter into the market and introduce differentiated solutions or services that are perceived to compete with our solutions, particularly if such competing solutions are adopted by an industry leader in a particular sector, our ability to sell our solutions could be impaired. As a result of these and other factors, we may be unable to attract new clients, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on our ability to retain our existing clients and increase the adoption of our services within our client base. Any failure to do so would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we are focused on retaining and expanding our services within our existing client base. A client can expand the fertility benefits they offer to their employees a number of ways, including by adding egg freezing or increasing the number of Smart Cycle units under their benefits plan (i.e., from two to three Smart Cycles per household). For example, 6% of our existing 2019 clients increased their Smart Cycle benefit for their 2020 benefits plan year. In addition, our fertility benefits solution clients can purchase our add-on Progyny Rx solution. We went live with Progyny Rx in 2018 and 70% of our clients have now launched this solution, including approximately 75% of the clients we signed in 2019.\nFactors that may affect our ability to retain our existing clients and sell additional solutions to them include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u00b7\nthe price, timeliness and outcomes of our solutions;\n\u00b7\nthe availability, price, timeliness, outcome, performance and functionality of competing solutions;\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain and appropriately expand our Center of Excellence network of high-quality fertility specialists;\n\u00b7\nour ability to offer complementary solutions and services that will enhance our comprehensive fertility offering;\n\u00b7\nchanges in healthcare laws, regulations or trends;\n\u00b7\nany material increase in unemployment rate;\n\u00b7\nthe business environment of our clients and, in particular, reduction in our clients\u2019 headcount; and\n\u00b7\nconsolidation of our clients, resulting in a change to their benefits program or a shift to one of our competitors.\nAny of the above factors, alone or together, could negatively affect our ability to retain existing clients and sell additional solutions to them, which would have an adverse effect on our business, revenue growth and results of operations.\nOur largest clients account for a significant portion of our revenue and a significant number of our clients are in the technology industry. The loss of one or more of these clients or changes within the technology industry could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently serve over 130 self-insured employers in the United States across more than 25 industries. In 2019 and 2018, each of our largest three clients represented more than 10% of our total revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, one of our clients accounted for 16% and 24% of our total revenue, respectively. In addition, another client accounted for 15% of our revenue for year ended December 31, 2019. Finally, a third client accounted for 10% and 14% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Engagement with these clients is generally covered through contracts that are multi-year in duration. One or more of these clients may terminate early or decline to renew their existing contracts with us upon expiration and any such termination or failure to renew could have a negative impact on our revenue and compromise our growth strategy. In addition, we generate a significant portion of our revenue from clients in the technology industry. Any of a variety of changes in that industry, including changes in economic conditions, mergers or consolidations, reduced spending on benefits programs and other factors, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the health insurance market could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe market for private health insurance in the United States is evolving and, as our solutions are integrated with health insurance plans offered by insurance carriers for our clients, our future financial performance will depend in part on the growth in this market. Changes and developments in the health insurance system in the United States, including taxability of medical benefits like ours, could reduce demand for our solutions and harm our business. For example, there has been an ongoing national debate relating to the health care reimbursement system in the United States. Some members of Congress have introduced proposals that would create a new single payor national health insurance program for all United States residents, others have proposed more incremental approaches such as creating a new public health insurance plan option as a supplement to private sources of coverage. In the event that laws, regulations or rules that eliminate or reduce private sources of health insurance or require such benefits to be taxable are adopted, the subsequent impact on the insurance carriers may in turn adversely impact our ability to accurately forecast future results and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe health benefits industry may be subject to negative publicity, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe health benefits industry may be subject to negative publicity, which can arise from, among other things, increases in premium rates, industry consolidation, cost of care initiatives, drug prices and the ongoing debate over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA. There remain judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Further, the United States Supreme Court announced on March 2, 2020 that it will consolidate two cases regarding the constitutionality of the ACA. It is unclear when such oral arguments are to be held and when a decision is expected to be made. In addition, negative publicity may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices, which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability. For example, PBM programs and drug rebates have recently been criticized as leading to a lack of transparency about the true cost of a drug, and this negative publicity may lead to regulatory changes that could potentially affect our business and operations. Negative public perception or publicity of the health benefits industry in general, the insurance carriers with whom we integrate our solutions, or us could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our computer systems, or those of our provider clinics, specialty pharmacies or other downstream vendors lag, fail or suffer security breaches, we may incur a material disruption of our services, which could materially impact our business and the results of operations.\nOur business is increasingly dependent on critical, complex and interdependent information technology systems, including cloud-based systems, to support business processes as well as internal and external communications. Our success therefore is dependent in part on our ability to secure, integrate, develop, redesign and enhance our (or contract with vendors to provide) technology systems that support our business strategy initiatives and processes in a compliant, secure, and cost and resource efficient manner. If we or our provider clinics, specialty pharmacies or other downstream vendors have an issue with our or their respective technology systems, it may result in a disruption to our operations or downstream disruption to our relationships with our clients or our selective network of high-quality fertility specialists. Additionally, if we choose to insource any of the services currently handled by a third party, it may result in technological or operational disruptions.\nIn addition, despite the implementation of security measures, our internal computer systems, and those of our provider clinics, specialty pharmacies or other downstream vendors, are potentially vulnerable to damage from malicious intrusion, malware, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. While we are not aware that we have experienced any such system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption to our ability to deliver our solutions. In addition, to the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss or inappropriate disclosure of confidential information, we could incur liability. See \u201c-Risks Related to Government Regulation-We operate in a highly regulated industry and must comply with a significant number of complex and evolving requirements-Data Protection and Breaches.\u201d\nA significant change in the utilization of our solutions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not control or impact the level of utilization of our solutions for each of our clients, in particular for newer clients. A significant reduction in the number of members using our solutions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Factors that could contribute to a reduction in the use of our solutions include: reductions in workforce by existing clients; general economic downturn that results in business failures and high unemployment rates; outbreaks of contagious diseases; employers no longer offering comprehensive health coverage or offering alternative solutions such as coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis; federal and state regulatory changes; changes to taxability of medical benefits; failure to adapt and respond effectively to changing medical landscape, changing regulations, changing client needs, requirements or preferences; premium increases and benefits changes; negative publicity, through social media or otherwise and news coverage.\nIt is also difficult for us to predict the level of utilization of our services at the member level. If the actual utilization of our services by members is significantly greater than budgeted, the client may be responsible for corresponding costs that exceed its planned expenditure. If we cannot help our clients accurately predict the level of utilization by their employees, our clients may turn to alternative solutions, and our business and profitability would be adversely impacted.\nIf we fail to offer high-quality support, our reputation could suffer.\nOur clients rely on our client account management personnel and our members rely on our PCAs to resolve issues and realize the full benefits that our solutions and services provide. High-quality support is also important for the renewal and expansion of our services to existing clients. The importance of our support functions will increase as we expand our business and pursue new clients. If we do not help our clients quickly resolve issues and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to maintain and expand our offerings to existing and new clients could suffer, and our reputation with existing or potential clients could suffer. Further, to the extent that we are unsuccessful in hiring, training and retaining adequate PCAs and client account management personnel, our ability to provide adequate and timely support to our members and clients would be negatively impacted, and our members\u2019 and clients\u2019 satisfaction with our solutions and services would be adversely affected.\nOur marketing efforts depend significantly on our ability to receive positive references from our existing clients.\nOur marketing efforts depend significantly on our ability to call on our current clients to provide positive references to new, potential clients. Given our limited number of long-term clients, the loss or dissatisfaction of any client could substantially harm our brand and reputation, inhibit the market adoption of our offering and impair our ability to attract new clients and maintain existing clients. Any of these consequences could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to effectively develop and expand our marketing and sales capabilities could harm our ability to increase our client base and achieve broader market acceptance of solutions we provide.\nOur ability to increase our client base and achieve broader market acceptance of solutions we provide will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our marketing and sales capabilities. We plan to continue expanding our direct sales force and to dedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs, including direct sales, inside sales, targeted direct marketing, advertising, digital marketing, e-newsletter and conference sponsorships. All of these efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources. Our business and results of operations could be harmed if our sales and marketing efforts do not generate significant increases in revenue. We may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from expanding our sales and marketing efforts if we are unable to hire, develop, integrate and retain talented and effective sales personnel, if our new and existing sales personnel, on the whole, are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, or if our sales and marketing programs are not effective.\nOur future revenue may not grow at the rates they historically have, or at all.\nWe have experienced significant growth since the launch of our fertility benefits solution in 2016. Revenue and our client base may not grow at the same rates they historically have, or they may decline in the future. Our future growth will depend, in part, on our ability to:\n\u00b7\ncontinue to attract new clients and maintain existing clients;\n\u00b7\nprice our solutions and services effectively so that we are able to attract new clients, expand sales to our existing clients and maintain profitability;\n\u00b7\nprovide our clients and members with client support that meets their needs, including through dedicated PCAs;\n\u00b7\nmaintain successful collection of member cost shares and other applicable receivable balances directly from members;\n\u00b7\nretain and maintain relationships with high-quality and respected fertility specialists;\n\u00b7\nattract and retain highly qualified personnel to support all clients and members;\n\u00b7\nmaintain satisfactory relationships with insurance carriers; and\n\u00b7\nincrease awareness of our brand and successfully compete with other companies.\nWe may not successfully accomplish all or any of these objectives, which may affect our future revenue, and which makes it difficult for us to forecast our future results of operations. In addition, if the assumptions that we use to plan our business are incorrect or change in reaction to changes in our market, it may be difficult for us to maintain profitability. You should not rely on our revenue for any prior quarterly or annual periods as any indication of our future revenue or revenue growth.\nIn addition, we expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on:\n\u00b7\nsales and marketing;\n\u00b7\nour technology infrastructure, including systems architecture, scalability, availability, performance and security; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral administration, including increased legal and accounting expenses associated with being a public company.\nThese investments may not result in increased revenue growth in our business. If we are unable to increase our revenue at a rate sufficient to offset the expected increase in our costs, our business, financial position, and results of operations will be harmed, and we may not be able to maintain profitability over the long term. Additionally, we may encounter unforeseen operating expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may result in losses in future periods.\nIf our revenue growth does not meet our expectations in future periods, we may not maintain profitability in the future, our business, financial position and results of operations may be harmed.\nIf the estimates and assumptions we use to determine the size of the target markets for our services are inaccurate, our future growth rate may be impacted and our business would be harmed.\nMarket opportunity estimates and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate. Furthermore, the healthcare industry is rapidly evolving and the markets for fertility benefits management and the related fertility pharmacy benefits management are relatively immature. Market opportunity estimates and growth forecasts, including those we have generated ourselves, are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate, including the risks described herein. Even if the markets in which we compete achieve the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\nOur estimates of the market opportunity for our services are based on the assumption that the purpose-built, data-driven and disruptive fertility benefits platform with the Smart Cycle plan design we offer will be attractive to employers. Employers may pursue alternatives or may not see the value in providing enhanced fertility-related coverage and services to their employees. In addition, we believe we are expanding the size of the fertility market as we enhance demand and increase awareness for fertility benefits. If these assumptions prove inaccurate, or if the increase in awareness of fertility benefits attracts potential competitors to enter the market and results in greater competition, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIt is difficult to predict member utilization rates and demand for our solutions, the entry of competitive solutions or the future growth rate and size of the fertility market, and more specifically the fertility benefits management market and the pharmacy benefits management market. The expansion of the fertility market depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: the continued trend of individuals starting families later in life, increase in number of single mothers by choice, adoption of non-traditional paths to parenthood and continued de-stigmatization of infertility. Further, the expansion of the fertility benefits management market and the pharmacy benefits market both depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: the continued trends of a competitive workforce with employers competing for talent based on benefits that they provide and employers\u2019 focus on benefits to attract and retain top talent.\nIf fertility benefits management or pharmacy benefits management do not continue to achieve market acceptance, or if there is a reduction in demand caused by a lack of client or member acceptance, a reduction in employers\u2019 focus on enhancing benefits to employees, weakening economic conditions, data security or privacy concerns, governmental regulation, competing offerings or otherwise, the market for our solutions and services might not continue to develop or might develop more slowly than we expect, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully manage our growth, and if we are not able to grow efficiently, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nAs usage of our solutions grows, we will need to devote additional resources to improving and maintaining our infrastructure. In addition, we will need to appropriately scale our internal business systems and our client account management and member services personnel to serve our growing client base. Any failure of or delay in these efforts could result in reduced client and member satisfaction, resulting in decreased sales to new clients and lower renewal and utilization rates by existing clients, which could hurt our revenue growth and our reputation. Even if we are successful in these efforts, they will require the dedication of management time and attention. We could also face inefficiencies or service disruptions as a result of our efforts to scale our internal infrastructure. We cannot be sure that the expansion and improvements to our internal infrastructure will be effectively implemented on a timely basis, and such failures could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnfavorable conditions in our industry or the United States economy, or reductions in employee benefits spending, could limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our results of operations.\nUnfavorable changes in our industry or in the United States economy could have a negative effect on ours and our clients\u2019 and potential clients\u2019 results of operations. Negative conditions in the general economy in the United States, including conditions resulting from changes in gross domestic product growth, financial and credit market fluctuations, international trade relations, political turmoil, natural catastrophes, outbreaks of contagious diseases, warfare and terrorist attacks on the United States, could cause a decrease in business investments, including spending on employee benefits, and negatively affect the growth of our business. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions could result in the cancellation by certain clients or material defaults by members on their cost share. Further, economic conditions including interest rate fluctuations, changes in capital market conditions and regulatory changes, such as the taxability of medical benefits like ours, may affect our ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms. In addition, the increased pace of consolidation in the healthcare industry may result in competitors with greater market power. We cannot predict the timing, strength, or duration of any economic slowdown, instability, or recovery, generally or within any particular industry.\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our sales and results of operations.\nOur business experiences moderate seasonality in revenue with a slightly higher proportion of revenue during the second half of the year as compared with the first half. Given that the majority of our clients contract with us for a January 1st benefits plan start date and that the average cost of treatments earlier in the overall treatment process is somewhat lower than the average cost as treatment progresses, our revenue from treatment services tend to grow as the year continues, particularly for new clients. In addition, as with most medical benefits plans, members will typically seek to maximize the use of their benefits once they have reached their annual deductible and/or annual out-of-pocket maximums, thereby increasing treatments in the latter part of the year. We expect that this seasonality will continue to affect our revenue and results of operations in the future as we continue to target larger enterprise clients.\nIn addition, the seasonality of our businesses could create cash flow management risks if we do not adequately anticipate and plan for periods of comparatively decreased cash flow, which could negatively impact our ability to execute on our strategy, which in turn could harm our results of operations. Accordingly, our results for any particular quarter may vary for a number of reasons, and we caution investors to evaluate our quarterly results in light of these factors.\nIf our new solutions and services are not adopted by our clients or members, or if we fail to innovate and develop new offerings that are adopted by our clients, our revenue and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nTo date, we have derived a substantial majority of our revenue from sales of our fertility benefits and Progyny Rx solutions. As we operate in an evolving industry, our long-term results of operations and continued growth will depend on our ability to successfully develop and market new successful solutions and services to our clients. If our existing clients and members do not value and/or are not willing to make additional payments for such new solutions or services, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to predict clients\u2019 or members\u2019 preferences, if the markets in which we participate change, including in response to government regulation, or if we are\nunable to modify our solutions and services on a timely basis, we may lose clients. Our results of operations would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of the members, appropriately timed with market opportunity or effectively brought to market.\nIf we fail to adapt and respond effectively to the changing medical landscape, changing regulations, changing client needs, requirements or preferences, our offerings may become less competitive.\nThe market in which we compete is subject to a changing medical landscape and changing regulations, as well as changing client needs, requirements and preferences. The success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to adapt and respond effectively to these changes on a timely basis. Our business strategy may not effectively respond to these changes, and we may fail to recognize and position ourselves to capitalize upon market opportunities. We may not have sufficient advance notice and resources to develop and effectively implement an alternative strategy. There may be scientific or clinical changes that require us to change our solutions or that make our solutions, including the Smart Cycles, less competitive in the marketplace. If there are sensitivities to our model or our existing competitors and new entrants create new disruptive business models and/or develop new solutions that clients and members prefer to our solutions, we may lose clients and members, and our results of operations, cash flows and/or prospects may be adversely affected. The future performance of our business will depend in large part on our ability to design and implement market appropriate strategic initiatives, some of which will occur over several years in a dynamic industry. If these initiatives do not achieve their objectives, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to expand our client base will be impaired and our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing the Progyny brand is important to support the marketing and sale of our existing and future solutions to new clients and expand sales of our solutions to existing clients. We also believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market increases. Successfully maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, our ability to provide reliable services that continue to meet the needs of our clients at competitive prices, our ability to maintain our clients\u2019 trust, our ability to continue to develop new solutions, and our ability to successfully differentiate our platform from competitive solutions and services. Our brand promotion activities may not generate client awareness or yield increased revenue, and even if they do, any increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building our brand. If we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nIf we fail to retain and motivate members of our management team or other key employees, or fail to attract additional qualified personnel to support our operations, our business and future growth prospects could be harmed.\nOur success and future growth depend largely upon the continued services of our management team and our other key employees. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team or other key employees resulting from the hiring or departure of these personnel. Our executive officers and other key employees are employed on an at-will basis, which means that these personnel could terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of one or more of our executive officers, or the failure by our executive team to effectively work with our employees and lead our company, could harm our business.\nIn addition, to execute our growth plan, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for these personnel is intense, especially for experienced sales and client account management personnel. There is no guarantee we will be able to attract such personnel or that competition among potential employers will not result in increased salaries or other benefits. From time to time, we have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached their legal obligations, resulting in a diversion of our time and resources. In addition, prospective and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines, experiences significant volatility, or increases such that prospective employees believe there is limited upside to the value of our equity awards, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain key employees. If we fail to attract\nnew personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be harmed.\nIf we cannot maintain our company culture as we grow, our success and our business and competitive position may be harmed.\nWe believe our culture has been a key contributor to our success to date and that the critical nature of the mission we are pursuing promotes a sense of greater purpose and fulfillment in our employees. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel, which is critical to our growth, and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives. As we grow and develop the infrastructure of a public company, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our culture. If we fail to maintain our company culture, our business and competitive position may be harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Relationships with Third Parties\nOur business depends on our ability to maintain our Center of Excellence network of high-quality fertility specialists and other healthcare providers. If we are unable to do so, our future growth would be limited and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.\nOur success is dependent upon our continued ability to maintain a selective Center of Excellence, our proprietary, credentialed network of high-quality fertility specialists. Fertility specialists could refuse to contract, demand higher payments or take other actions that could result in higher medical costs, less attractive service for our members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. Identifying high-quality fertility specialists, credentialing and negotiating contracts with them and evaluating, monitoring and maintaining our network, requires significant time and resources. If we are not successful in maintaining our relationships with top fertility specialists, these fertility specialists may refuse to renew their contracts with us, and potential competitors may be effective in onboarding these or other high-quality fertility specialists to create a similarly high-quality network. There may be additional shifts in the fertility specialty provider space as the fertility market matures, and high-quality fertility specialists may become more demanding in re-negotiating to remain in our network. Our ability to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with high-quality fertility specialists also may be negatively impacted by other factors not associated with us, such as regulatory changes impacting providers or consolidation activity among hospitals, physician groups and healthcare providers. In addition, certain organizations of physicians, such as practice management companies (which group together physician practices for administrative efficiency), may change the way in which healthcare providers do business with us and may compete directly with us, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the perceived value of our solutions and our reputation may be negatively impacted if the services provided by one or more of our fertility specialists are not satisfactory to our members, including as a result of provider error that could result in litigation. For example, if a provider within our network experiences an issue with their cryopreservation techniques or releases sensitive information of our members, we could incur additional expenses and it could give rise to litigation against us. Any such issue with one of our providers may expose us to public scrutiny, adversely affect our brand and reputation, expose us to litigation or regulatory action, and otherwise make our operations vulnerable. Further, if a fertility specialist provides services that result in less than favorable outcomes, this could cause us to fail to meet our contractually guaranteed specified service metrics, and we could be obligated to provide the client with a fee reduction. The failure to maintain our selective network of high-quality fertility specialists or the failure of those specialists to meet and exceed our members\u2019 expectations, may result in a loss of or inability to grow or maintain our client base, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with, and monitoring of, third parties, including vendors, as well as insurance carriers.\nIn order to grow our business, we anticipate that we will continue to depend on our relationships with third parties, including vendors and insurance carriers. As the fertility management market and our client base grow, if we do not successfully maintain our relationships with insurance carriers, they may make integration more difficult or expensive, such as implementing an onerous fee structure in exchange for our ability to continue to integrate our solutions with their\nplatforms. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our results of operations may suffer.\nIn addition, our arrangements with these third parties may expose us to public scrutiny, adversely affect our brand and reputation, expose us to litigation or regulatory action, and otherwise make our operations vulnerable if we fail to adequately monitor their performance or if they fail to meet their contractual obligations to us or to comply with applicable laws or regulations.\nIf we fail to maintain an efficient pharmacy distribution network or if there is a disruption to our distribution network, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.\nThe timely delivery of fertility prescriptions is essential for fertility treatments. If prescriptions are delivered late, the delay may result in postponement of a member\u2019s treatment cycle and member dissatisfaction with our solutions. We believe that our ability to maintain and grow the adoption of Progyny Rx is highly dependent on our success in maintaining an efficient pharmacy distribution network and our record of on-time delivery. If we are unable to maintain an efficient pharmacy distribution network, or if a significant disruption thereto should occur, the use of Progyny Rx may decline due to the inability to timely deliver prescription to members, which could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to suffer.\nIf we lose our relationship with one or more key pharmaceutical manufacturers, or if the rebates provided by pharmaceutical manufactures decline, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe maintain contractual relationships with select pharmaceutical manufacturers which provide us with access to limited distribution specialty pharmaceutical rebates for drugs we purchase. The consolidation of pharmaceutical manufacturers, the shortages of drugs provided by such manufacturers, the termination or material alteration of our contractual relationships, or our failure to renew such contracts on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, PBM programs have been the subject of debate in federal and state legislatures and various other public and governmental forums. Adoption of new laws, rules or regulations or changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws, rules or regulations, relating to any of these programs could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur marketing efforts depend on our ability to maintain our relationship with benefits consultants.\nWe sell our solutions through our sales organization and, in many cases, we leverage our relationships with top benefits consultants to establish relationships with potential clients. Our sales team has broad experience in health benefits management and extensive pre-existing long-term relationships with industry participants and benefits executives at large employers. If we fail to maintain our relationship with the benefits consultants, our marketing efforts, business and profitability would be adversely impacted.\nWe are exposed to credit risk from our members.\nWe collect copayments, coinsurance and deductibles directly from members. We do not require collateral for such receivables. Our failure to collect a significant portion of the amount due on such receivables directly from members could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and must comply with a significant number of complex and evolving requirements.\nWe have attempted to structure our operations to comply with laws, regulations and other requirements applicable to us directly and to our clients and vendors, but there can be no assurance that our operations will not be challenged or impacted by regulatory authorities or enforcement initiatives. We have been, and in the future may become, involved in governmental investigations, audits, reviews and assessments. Any determination by a court or agency that our solutions or services violate, or cause our clients to violate, applicable laws, regulations or other requirements could subject us or our clients to significant administrative, civil or criminal penalties. Such a determination also could require us to change\nor terminate portions of our business, disqualify us from serving clients that do business with government entities, or cause us to refund some or all of our service fees or otherwise compensate our clients. In addition, failure to satisfy laws, regulations or other requirements could adversely affect demand for our solutions and could force us to expend significant capital, research and development and other resources to address the failure. Even an unsuccessful challenge by regulatory and other authorities or parties could be expensive and time-consuming, could result in loss of business, exposure to adverse publicity, and injury to our reputation and could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract clients. If we fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other requirements, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Such non-compliance could also require significant investment to address and may prove costly. There are several additional federal and state statutes, regulations, guidance and contractual provisions related to or impacting the healthcare industry that may apply to our business activities directly or indirectly, including, but not limited to:\n\uf0b7 Licensing and Licensed Personnel. Many states have licensure or registration requirements for entities acting as a third-party administrator, or TPA, and PBMs. The scope of these laws differs from state to state, and the application of such laws to the activities of TPAs and PBMs is often unclear. Given the nature and scope of the solutions and services that we provide, we are required to maintain TPA and PBM licenses and registrations in certain jurisdictions and to ensure that such licenses and registrations are in good standing on an annual basis. We are licensed, have licensure applications pending before appropriate regulatory bodies, are exempt from licensure or registration, or are otherwise authorized under such laws in those states in which we provide our TPA and PBM services. These licenses require us to comply with the rules and regulations of the governmental bodies that issued such licenses. Our failure to comply with such rules and regulations could result in significant administrative penalties, the suspension of a license, or the loss of a license, all of which could negatively impact our business. Additionally, from time to time, legislation is considered that would purport to declare a PBM a fiduciary with respect to its clients. While the validity of such laws is questionable and we do not believe any such laws are currently in effect, we cannot predict what effect, if any, such statutes, if enacted, may have on our business and financial results.\nSeparately, states impose licensing requirements on insurers, risk-bearing entities, and insurance agents, as well as those entities that provide utilization review services. We do not believe that the nature of our services requires us to be licensed under applicable state law. We are unable to predict, however, how our services may be viewed by regulators over time, how these laws and regulations will be interpreted, or the full extent of their application. If a regulatory authority in any state determines that the nature of our business requires that we be licensed under applicable state laws, we may need to restructure our business to comply with any related requirements, such as maintaining adequate reserves, creating new compliance processes, hiring additional personnel to manage regulatory compliance, and paying additional regulatory fees, which could adversely affect our results of operation. Additionally, we may need to cease operations until we are able to obtain appropriate licensure, which may adversely affect our revenue for a period of time that we cannot estimate.\nIn addition, we employ PCAs to support and guide our members as part of our fertility benefits management services. The PCAs do not provide any licensed healthcare services, and in turn, are not licensed by any regulatory body to provide these services. We otherwise do not employ individuals to provide any healthcare services requiring licensure. If a professional board in any state determines that the services provided by our employed PCAs require a license to be provided, we may need to conduct additional training and credentialing, replace staff, obtain additional insurance, and pay increased salaries, which could adversely affect our results of operation. We may additionally need to suspend the PCA services we provide while our personnel obtains the necessary licensure, which may adversely affect our relationships with our clients and members and cause us to be in breach of our contracts.\n\uf0b7 HIPAA Privacy and Security Requirements. There are numerous federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of health information. In particular, regulations promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of certain individually identifiable health information (known as \u201cprotected health information\u201d) and require the implementation of administrative, physical and technological safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity and\navailability of electronic protected health information. The privacy regulations established under HIPAA also provide patients with rights related to understanding and controlling how their protected health information is used and disclosed. As a provider of services to entities subject to HIPAA, we are directly subject to certain provisions of the regulations as a \u201cBusiness Associate.\u201d When acting as a Business Associate under HIPAA, to the extent permitted by applicable privacy regulations and contracts and associated Business Associate Agreements with our clients, we are permitted to use and disclose protected health information to perform our services and for other limited purposes, but other uses and disclosures, such as marketing communications, require written authorization from the patient or must meet an exception specified under the privacy regulations. We also have downstream Business Associates, which provide us with services and are also subject to HIPAA regulations.\nIf we, or any of our downstream Business Associates, are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of protected health information entrusted to us, we could be found to have breached our contracts with our clients and be subject to investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, Office for Civil Rights, or OCR. In the event OCR finds that we have failed to comply with applicable HIPAA privacy and security standards, we could face civil and criminal penalties. In addition, OCR performs compliance audits of Covered Entities and Business Associates in order to proactively enforce the HIPAA privacy and security standards. OCR has become an increasingly active regulator and has signaled its intention to continue this trend. OCR has the discretion to impose penalties and may require companies to enter into resolution agreements and corrective action plans which impose ongoing compliance requirements. OCR enforcement activity, or a third-party audit related to a HIPAA incident regarding us or a third-party vendor, can result in financial liability and reputational harm, and responses to such enforcement activity can consume significant internal resources. In addition to enforcement by OCR, state attorneys general are authorized to bring civil actions under either HIPAA or relevant state laws seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations that threaten the privacy of state residents. Although we have implemented and maintain policies, processes and compliance program infrastructure to assist us in complying with these laws and regulations and our contractual obligations, we cannot provide assurance regarding how these laws and regulations will be interpreted, enforced or applied to our operations. In addition to the risks associated with enforcement activities and potential contractual liabilities, our ongoing efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations at the federal and state levels also might require us to make costly system purchases and/or modifications or otherwise divert significant resources to HIPAA compliance initiatives from time to time.\n\uf0b7 Other Privacy and Security Requirements. In addition to HIPAA, numerous other federal and state laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to and confidentiality of personal information, some of which may be applicable to our business. Certain federal and state laws protect types of personal information that may be viewed as particularly sensitive. For example, New York\u2019s Public Health Law, Article 27-F protects information that could reveal confidential HIV-related information about an individual. In many cases, state laws are more restrictive than, and not preempted by, HIPAA, and may allow personal rights of action with respect to privacy or security breaches, as well as fines. State laws are contributing to increased enforcement activity and may also be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities. Further, California recently enacted the CCPA, which went into operation on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. Some observers have noted that the CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States, which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business.\nCertain of our solutions and services involve the transmission and storage of client and member data in various jurisdictions, which subjects the operation of those solutions and services to privacy or data protection laws and regulations in those jurisdictions. While we believe these solutions and services comply with current regulatory and security requirements in the jurisdictions in which we provide these solutions and services, there can be no assurance that such requirements will not change or that we will not otherwise\nbe subject to legal or regulatory actions. These laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and changing, and could have an adverse impact on our operations. These laws and regulations are subject to uncertainty in how they may be interpreted and enforced by government authorities and regulators. The costs of compliance with, and the other burdens imposed by, these and other laws or regulatory actions may increase our operational costs, prevent us from providing our solutions, and/or impact our ability to invest in or jointly develop our solutions. We also may face audits or investigations by one or more government agencies relating to our compliance with these laws and regulations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could result in fines, penalties, other liability, or could result in adverse publicity or a loss of reputation, and adversely affect our business. Any failure or perceived failure by us or by our solutions to comply with these laws and regulations may subject us to legal or regulatory actions, damage our reputation or adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions in the jurisdiction that has enacted the applicable law or regulation. Moreover, if these laws and regulations change, or are interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our policies and processes or the operation of our solutions, we may need to expend resources in order to change our business operations, policies and processes or the manner in which we provide our solutions. This could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\uf0b7 Data Protection and Breaches. In recent years, there have been a number of well-publicized data breaches involving the improper dissemination of personal information of individuals both within and outside of the healthcare industry. Laws in all 50 states require businesses to provide notice to clients whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. The laws are not consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is costly. States are also constantly amending existing laws, requiring attention to frequently changing regulatory requirements. Most states require holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals or the state\u2019s attorney general. In some states, these laws are limited to electronic data, but states increasingly are enacting or considering stricter and broader requirements.\nAdditionally, under HIPAA, Covered Entities must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay, not to exceed 60 days following discovery of the breach by a Covered Entity or its agents. Notification also must be made to OCR and, in certain circumstances involving large breaches, to the media. Business Associates must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to Covered Entities within 60 days of discovery of the breach by the Business Associate or its agents or such shorter period as set forth in the applicable Business Associate Agreement. A non-permitted use or disclosure of protected health information is presumed to be a breach under HIPAA unless the Covered Entity or Business Associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised consistent with requirements enumerated in HIPAA.\nDespite our security management efforts with respect to physical and technological safeguards, employee training, vendor (and sub-vendor) controls and contractual relationships, our infrastructure, data or other operation centers and systems used in our business operations, including the internet and related systems of our vendors (including vendors to whom we outsource data hosting, storage and processing functions) are vulnerable to, and from time to time experience, unauthorized access to data and/or breaches of confidential information due to a variety of causes. Techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or compromise systems change frequently, are becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, and are often not detected until after an incident has occurred. As a result, we might not be able to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate preventive measures, or immediately detect a potential compromise. If our security measures, some of which are managed by third parties, or the security measures of our service providers or vendors, are breached or fail, it is possible that unauthorized or illegal access to or acquisition, disclosure, use or processing of personal information, confidential information, or other sensitive client, member, or employee data, including HIPAA-regulated protected health information, may occur. A security breach or failure could result from a variety of circumstances and events, including third-party action, human negligence or error, malfeasance, employee theft or misuse, phishing and other social engineering schemes, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, failures during the process of upgrading or replacing\nsoftware, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, and catastrophic events.\nIf our security measures, or those of our service providers or vendors, were to be breached or fail, our reputation could be severely damaged, adversely affecting client or investor confidence. As a result, clients may curtail their use of or stop using our offering and our business may suffer. In addition, we could face litigation, damages for contract breach, penalties and regulatory actions for violation of HIPAA and other laws or regulations applicable to data protection and significant costs for remediation and for measures to prevent future occurrences. In addition, any potential security breach could result in increased costs associated with liability for stolen assets or information, repairing system damage that may have been caused by such breaches, incentives offered to clients or other business partners in an effort to maintain the business relationships after a breach and implementing measures to prevent future occurrences, including organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees and engaging third-party experts and consultants. Negative publicity may also result from real, threatened or perceived security breaches affecting us or our industry or clients, which could cause us to lose clients or partners and adversely affect our operations and future prospects. While we maintain cyber insurance covering certain security and privacy damages and claim expenses, we may not carry insurance or maintain coverage sufficient to compensate for all liability and such insurance may not be available for renewal on acceptable terms or at all, and in any event, insurance coverage would not address the reputational damage that could result from a security incident.\n\uf0b7 HIPAA Transaction and Identifier Standards. HIPAA and its implementing regulations mandate format and data content standards and provider identifier standards (known as the National Provider Identifier) that must be used in certain electronic transactions, such as claims, payment advice and eligibility inquiries. HHS has established standards that health plans must use for electronic fund transfers with providers, has established operating rules for certain transactions, and is in the process of establishing operating rules to promote uniformity in the implementation of the remaining types of covered transactions. The ACA also requires HHS to establish standards for health claims attachment transactions. HHS has modified the standards for electronic healthcare transactions (e.g., eligibility, claims submission and payment and electronic remittance) from Version 4010/4010A to Version 5010. Further, HHS now requires the use of updated standard code sets for diagnoses and procedures known as the ICD-10 code sets. Enforcement of compliance with these standards falls under HHS and is carried out by CMS.\nIn the event new requirements are imposed, we will be required to modify our systems and processes to accommodate these changes. We will seek to modify our systems and processes as needed to prepare for and implement changes to the transaction standards, code sets operating rules and identifier requirements; however, we may not be successful in responding to these changes, and any responsive changes we make to our systems and processes may result in errors or otherwise negatively impact our service levels. In addition, the compliance dates for new or modified transaction standards, operating rules and identifiers may overlap, which may further burden our resources.\n\uf0b7 Fraud and Abuse Laws. Many of our clients, insurance carriers, and network healthcare providers are impacted directly and indirectly by certain fraud and abuse laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Physician Self-Referral Law, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, and the False Claims Act, as well as their state equivalents. Because the solutions and services we provide are not reimbursed by government healthcare payors, such fraud and abuse laws generally do not directly apply to our business, however, some laws may be applicable. For example, certain states have anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope than analogous federal laws and may apply regardless of payor.\nThe laws, regulations and other requirements in this area are both broad and vague and judicial interpretation can also be inconsistent. We review our practices with regulatory experts in an effort to comply with all applicable laws, regulatory and other requirements. However, we are unable to predict how these laws, regulations and other requirements will be interpreted or the full extent of their application, particularly to services that are not directly reimbursed by federal healthcare programs. Any determination by a federal or\nstate regulatory authority that any of our activities or those of our clients or vendors violate any of these laws or regulations could subject us to significant administrative, civil or criminal penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines or imprisonment, require us to enter into corporate integrity agreements or similar agreements with ongoing compliance obligations, disqualify us from providing services to clients that are, or do business with, government programs and/or have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even an unsuccessful challenge by a regulatory authority of our activities could result in adverse publicity and could require a costly response from us.\n\uf0b7 ERISA Regulation. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA, regulates certain aspects of employee pension and health benefits plans, including self-funded corporate health plans sponsored by our clients, with which we have agreements to provide TPA services. As part of our agreements with a number of these clients, we offer PBM services through Progyny Rx. We believe the conduct of our business vis-\u00e0-vis these plans is not generally subject to the fiduciary obligations of ERISA. However, there can be no assurance the United States Department of Labor, or the DOL, which is the agency that enforces ERISA, would not in the future assert that the fiduciary obligations imposed by ERISA apply to certain aspects of our operations or courts would not reach such a ruling in private ERISA litigation. In addition to its fiduciary provisions, ERISA has broad preemptive effect and has been held to preempt state laws imposing transparency requirements on PBMs. ERISA also imposes civil and criminal liability on service providers to health plans subject to ERISA and certain other persons with relationships to such plans if certain forms of illegal or prohibited remuneration are made or received by such service providers or other persons. These provisions of ERISA are similar, but not identical, to the healthcare anti-kickback laws described above, although ERISA lacks the statutory and regulatory \u201csafe harbor\u201d exceptions incorporated into the healthcare anti-kickback laws. Like the healthcare anti-kickback laws, the corresponding provisions of ERISA are broadly written and their application to particular cases can be uncertain. Employee benefits plans subject to ERISA are subject to certain rules, published by the DOL, including certain reporting requirements for direct and indirect compensation received by plan service providers. However, many self-funded health plans such as the plans that we have contracts with are exempt from these reporting requirements under current law. At this time, we are unable to predict whether the DOL will issue additional regulations or guidance on reporting or which additional regulations, if any, may be proposed in formal rulemaking by the DOL.\n\uf0b7 Prompt Pay Laws. Certain states have laws regulating the amount of time that may elapse from when a third-party payor receives a claim for services rendered to when those services are paid. These \u201cprompt pay\u201d laws may impact us as well as our clients and insurance carriers. Under these \u201cprompt pay\u201d laws, we may be obligated to pay healthcare providers within established time periods, and such time periods may be shorter than existing contracted terms and/or via electronic transfer. In many states, we are deemed to be exempt from the prompt pay laws, however, we seek to comply with them in each state in which we do business to the extent applicable, and our efforts include the use of controls such as policies and processing systems that ensure we pay claims as quickly as possible and contract language related to timeframes permitted by applicable law. If we do not make payments to healthcare providers in a timely fashion consistent with prompt pay laws, we may be required to pay interest in addition to any amounts owed to such providers. In addition, our reputation may be harmed and our contractual obligations to certain clients may be breached, causing us to lose revenue or otherwise pay penalties under such contracts.\n\uf0b7 Network Adequacy and Access Requirements. Network adequacy and access laws require health plans to maintain a network of healthcare providers sufficient to deliver the benefits they contract to provide to their enrollees. In light of the increase in \u201cnarrow networks\u201d, there has been a legislative push to ensure that commercial payors contract with a sufficient number of healthcare providers to create an \u201cadequate network.\u201d Additionally, a majority of states now have some form of legislation affecting our payor clients\u2019 ability to limit access to a provider network or remove a provider from the network. Such legislation may require our clients to admit any healthcare provider including any pharmacy provider willing to meet the plan\u2019s price and other terms for network participation (\u201cany willing provider\u201d legislation) or may provide that a provider may not be removed from a network except in compliance with certain procedures (\u201cdue process\u201d legislation). Further, to ensure network adequacy and quality, a network may seek to accredit its healthcare providers through any number of accrediting bodies, such as the National Committee for Quality Assurance,\nor NCQA, and the Utilization Review Accreditation Commission. We follow NCQA standards to credential the health providers with whom we contract to provide services within our network, and engage Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare to conduct provider credentialing where required. Should any of the states we operate in determine that our network of providers does not meet adequacy or access requirements, we may be subject to administrative penalties and other administrative actions, as well as private litigation. In addition, if we are unable to contract with a sufficient number of providers, we may become subject to administrative penalties or enforcement actions from state regulatory agencies, litigation from consumers, and may be in breach of certain contractual covenants with our partners.\n\uf0b7 Consumer Protection Laws. Federal and state consumer protection laws are being applied increasingly by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, and states\u2019 attorneys general to regulate the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal or health information, through websites or otherwise, and to regulate the presentation of website content. Courts may also adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the FTC, which concern consumer notice, choice, security and access. Consumer protection laws require us to publish statements to users of our services that describe how we handle personal information and choices consumers may have about the way we handle personal information. If such information that we publish is considered untrue, we may be subject to claims of unfair or deceptive trade practices, which could lead to significant liabilities and consequences, including, costs of defending against litigation, settling claims and loss of willingness of current and future clients to work with us.\n\uf0b7 Restrictions on Communication. Communications with our members increasingly may be subject to and restricted by laws and regulations governing communications via telephone, fax, text, and email. We also use email and social media platforms as marketing tools. For example, we maintain social media accounts. As laws and regulations, including FTC enforcement, rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices, the failure by us, our employees or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations or subject us to fines or other penalties.\nThe healthcare regulatory and political framework is uncertain and evolving. Recent and future developments in the healthcare industry could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAll of our revenue is derived from the healthcare industry, which is highly regulated and subject to changing political, legislative, regulatory and other influences. Healthcare laws and regulations are rapidly evolving and may change significantly in the future. For example, while ACA does not directly regulate our business as a benefit area, it does affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by certain insurance carriers and certain of our clients, taxability of such plans, as well as the overall reimbursement and drug pricing environment for healthcare providers. There remain judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Further, the United States Supreme Court announced on March 2, 2020 that it will consolidate two cases regarding the constitutionality of the ACA. It is unclear when a decision is expected to be made. Health reform efforts, including reforms to the ACA, and measures that would expand the role of government-sponsored coverage, including single payer or so-called \u201cMedicare-for-All\u201d proposals, which could have far-reaching implications for the healthcare industry if enacted.\nWe are unable to predict the full impact of health reform initiatives on our operations in light of the uncertainty regarding whether, when and how the ACA will be further changed, what alternative reforms (including single payer proposals), if any, may be enacted, the timing of enactment and implementation of alternative provisions and the impact of alternative provisions on various healthcare industry participants.\nGovernment regulation, industry standards and other requirements create risks and challenges with respect to our compliance efforts and our business strategies.\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequently changing laws, regulations, industry standards and other requirements. Many healthcare laws and regulations are complex, and their application to specific\nsolutions, services and relationships may not be clear. Because our clients are subject to various requirements, we may be impacted as a result of our contractual obligations even when we are not directly subject to such requirements. In particular, many existing healthcare laws and regulations, when enacted, did not anticipate the solutions and services that we provide, and these laws and regulations may be applied to our solutions and services in ways that we do not anticipate. The ACA, efforts to repeal or materially change the ACA, and other federal and state efforts to reform or revise aspects of the healthcare industry or to revise or create additional legal or and regulatory requirements could impact our operations, the use of our solutions and services, and our ability to market new solutions and services, or could create unexpected liabilities for us. There have also been a number of reform efforts around PBMs including pricing and transparency which could affect our business. We also may be impacted by laws, industry standards and other requirements that are not specific to the healthcare industry, such as consumer protection laws and payment card industry standards. These requirements may impact our operations and, if not followed, could result in fines, penalties and other liabilities and adverse publicity and injury to our reputation.\nWe are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering, and similar laws, and non-compliance with such laws can subject us to criminal or civil liability and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we operate only in the United States, we remain subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.S. domestic bribery laws, and other anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws have been enforced aggressively in recent years and are interpreted broadly to generally prohibit companies, their employees and their third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to recipients in the public or private sector. If we expand our business and sales outside the United States and to the public sector, we may engage with business partners and third-party intermediaries to market our services and to obtain for us the necessary permits, licenses, and other regulatory approvals. In addition, we or our third-party intermediaries may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities.\nDetecting, investigating, and resolving actual or alleged violations of anti-corruption laws can require a significant diversion of time, resources, and attention from senior management. In addition, noncompliance with anti-corruption, anti-bribery, or anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, prosecution, enforcement actions, sanctions, settlements, fines, damages, other civil or criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension or debarment from contracting with certain persons, reputational harm, adverse media coverage, and other collateral consequences. If any subpoenas or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal proceeding, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny potential sales to government entities are subject to a number of challenges and risks.\nWe may sell our services or solutions to U.S. federal, state, and local government, and agency, clients. Sales to such entities are subject to a number of challenges and risks. Selling to such entities can be highly competitive, expensive, and time-consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale. Government contracting requirements may change and in doing so restrict our ability to sell into the government sector until we have attained the revised certification. Government demand and payment for our offerings is dependent on many factors outside our control, including general economic conditions, public sector budgetary constraints and funding authorizations, and general political priorities, with funding reductions or delays adversely affecting public sector demand for our offerings.\nFurther, governmental and highly regulated entities may demand contract terms that differ from our standard arrangements. Such entities may have statutory, contractual, or other legal rights to terminate contracts with us or our\npartners due to a default or for other reasons. Any such termination may adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny failure to protect our intellectual property rights could impair our ability to protect our proprietary technology and our brand.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to protect our brand and proprietary trade secret and confidential information, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, maintaining, defending and enforcing our intellectual property rights. We rely on our agreements with our clients, and non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties, and our trademarks, trade secrets, and copyrights to protect our intellectual property rights. However, any of these parties may breach such agreements and disclose our proprietary information, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain, maintain, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, or that such intellectual property rights will not be challenged, narrowed, held unenforceable or circumvented. Therefore, these legal protections and precautions may not prevent infringement, misappropriation or other violations of our intellectual property. Any litigation and any infringement, misappropriation or other violations of our intellectual property could hinder our ability to market and sell our solutions, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, we would have no right to prevent them from using that technology or information to compete with us and our competitive position would be harmed.\nThird parties may allege that our products and services, or the conduct of our business, infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate such third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. Even if such claims are without merit, defending such claims would cause us to incur substantial expenses and could cause us to pay substantial damages or seek a costly license if we are found to be infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. If we are unable to enter into a license on acceptable terms or at all, we could be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations or be forced to redesign our products or services so that we no longer infringe the third-party intellectual property rights, which may result in significant cost and delay to us, or which redesign could be technically infeasible. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our employees and management personnel from their normal responsibilities.\nMoreover, although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any third parties, including such individual\u2019s former employer. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nFurthermore, we currently own registered trademarks. In addition, any of our trademarks or trade names, whether registered or unregistered, may be challenged, opposed, infringed, cancelled, circumvented or declared generic, or determined to be infringing on other marks, as applicable. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we will need to build name recognition by potential collaborators or clients in our markets of interest.\nAny litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend and could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have in the past and may in the future become subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our clients or vendors in connection with commercial disputes or employment claims made by our current or former employees. We are currently in arbitration with a former vendor who alleges a breach of our contract with such vendor, as described in Part I, Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We are unable to predict the outcome of any of these legal proceedings. Such proceedings might result in substantial costs, regardless of the outcome, and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which might seriously\nharm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Insurance might not cover such claims, might not provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more such claims, and might not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, potentially harming our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAcquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, or alliances could be difficult to identify, pose integration challenges, divert the attention of management, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may in the future seek to acquire or invest in businesses, joint ventures, products and services, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. Any such acquisition or investment may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating and pursuing suitable opportunities, whether or not the transactions are completed, and may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. In particular, we may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products and services, personnel or operations of the acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired company choose not to work for us, they are operationally difficult to integrate, or we have difficulty retaining the clients of any acquired business due to changes in ownership, management or otherwise. These transactions may also disrupt our business, divert our resources, and require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for development of our existing business. Any such transactions that we are able to complete may not result in any synergies or other benefits we had expected to achieve, which could result in impairment charges that could be substantial. In addition, we may not be able to find and identify desirable acquisition targets or business opportunities or be successful in entering into an agreement with any particular strategic partner. These transactions could also result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, which could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, if the resulting business from such a transaction fails to meet our expectations, or we fail to successfully integrate such businesses into our own, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected or we may be exposed to unknown risks or liabilities.\nThe December 2017 U.S. federal tax reform may subject us to potential adverse tax consequences.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, enacted in December 2017, among other things, includes changes to U.S. federal tax rates, imposes additional limitations on the deductibility of interest, has both positive and negative changes to the utilization of future net operating loss carryforwards, allows for the expensing of certain capital expenditures, and puts into effect the migration from a \u201cworldwide\u201d system of taxation to a \u201cquasi-territorial system\u201d. Our net deferred tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowance have been revalued at the U.S. corporate rate, which the Tax Act reduced to 21%. We continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is uncertain and could be adverse.\nChanges in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur effective tax rate could increase due to several factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nchanges in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;\n\u00b7\nchanges in tax laws, tax treaties, and regulations or the interpretation of them, including the Tax Act;\n\u00b7\nchanges to our assessment about our ability to realize our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic and political environments in which we do business;\n\u00b7\nthe outcome of future tax audits, examinations, or administrative appeals; and\n\u00b7\nlimitations or adverse findings regarding our ability to do business in some jurisdictions.\nAny of these developments could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nCertain U.S. state tax authorities may assert that we have a state nexus and seek to impose state and local income taxes which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe currently file state income tax returns in certain states. There is a risk that certain state tax authorities where we do not currently file a state income tax return could assert that we are liable for state and local income taxes based upon income or gross receipts allocable to such states. States are becoming increasingly aggressive in asserting a nexus for state income tax purposes. We could be subject to state and local taxation, including penalties and interest attributable to prior periods, if a state tax authority in which we do not currently file a state income tax return successfully asserts that our activities give rise to a taxable nexus. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to utilize a significant portion of our net operating loss or research tax credit carryforwards, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $92 million and $71 million, respectively, due to prior period losses, some of which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2031 for federal and state purposes. Federal and California research and development tax credit carryforwards are approximately $729,000 and $830,000, respectively. The federal research and development tax credits begin to expire in 2030, and the California research and development tax credits have no expiration date. These net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nIn addition, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes in any taxable year may be limited if we experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d A Section 382 \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. Future issuances of our stock could cause an \u201cownership change.\u201d Any future ownership change, which could be outside of our control, could also have a material effect on the use of our net operating loss carryforwards or other tax attributes, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nOur reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and could affect the reporting of transactions already completed before the announcement of a change.\nFor example, in February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. As an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we are allowed under the JOBS Act to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. The adoption of new or revised accounting principles may require us to make changes to our systems, processes and control, which could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations, retroactively affect previously reported results or require us to make costly changes to our operational processes and accounting systems upon or following the adoption of these standards.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in Part II, Item 7. \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant estimates and judgments used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to the determination of fair value of our common stock, estimates of accounts receivable relating to member copayments and revenue recognition relating to services rendered but for which no claim has yet been reported, among others. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile, and the value of our common stock may decline.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and may fluctuate or decline substantially as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition or results of operations;\n\u00b7\nvariance in our financial performance from expectations of securities analysts;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the pricing of our solutions and services;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our projected operating and financial results;\n\u00b7\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our products and solutions;\n\u00b7\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant business developments, acquisitions, or new offerings;\n\u00b7\nsignificant data breaches of our company, providers, vendors or pharmacies;\n\u00b7\nour involvement in litigation;\n\u00b7\nfuture sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders, as well as the anticipation of lock-up releases;\n\u00b7\nchanges in senior management or key personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe trading volume of our common stock;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the anticipated future size and growth rate of our market; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic, industry, and market conditions.\nBroad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, regulatory, and market conditions, may also negatively impact the market price of our common stock. These and other factors may cause the market price\nand demand for our common stock to fluctuate substantially, which may limit or prevent investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity of our common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future, which could result in substantial expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nAn active public trading market for our common stock may not be sustained. The lack of an active market may impair your ability to sell your shares at the time you wish to sell them or at a price that you consider reasonable. The lack of an active market may also reduce the fair value of your shares. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations by selling shares and may impair our ability to acquire other companies or technologies by using our shares as consideration.\nWe expect fluctuations in our financial results, making it difficult to project future results, and if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors with respect to our results of operations, our stock price and the value of your investment could decline.\nOur results of operations may fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, our past results may not be indicative of our future performance. In addition to the other risks described herein, factors that may affect our results of operations include the following:\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in demand for or pricing of our solutions;\n\u00b7\nour ability to attract new clients;\n\u00b7\nour ability to retain our existing clients;\n\u00b7\nclient expansion rates;\n\u00b7\nchanges in clients\u2019 budgets and in the timing of their budget cycles and purchasing decisions;\n\u00b7\nour ability to control costs, including our operating expenses and healthcare costs;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of payment for operating expenses, particularly sales and marketing expenses;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of non-cash expenses, including stock-based compensation, goodwill impairments and other non-cash charges;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of costs associated with recruiting, training and integrating new employees and retaining and motivating existing employees;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic conditions, as well as economic conditions specifically affecting industries in which our clients participate;\n\u00b7\nthe impact of new accounting pronouncements;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the competitive dynamics of our market, including consolidation among competitors or clients; and\n\u00b7\nsignificant security breaches of, technical difficulties with, or interruptions to, the delivery and use of our solutions and services.\nAny of these and other factors, or the cumulative effect of some of these factors, may cause our results of operations to vary significantly. If our quarterly results of operations fall below the expectations of investors and securities analysts who follow our stock, the price of our common stock could decline substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nIn connection with our preparation of our annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could harm us.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In connection with our audit of the fiscal year 2018 consolidated financial statements, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified one material weakness in our controls related to the lack of review and oversight over financial reporting. We determined that we had insufficient financial statement close processes and procedures relating to the classification and presentation of certain revenue and expenses. Under standards established by the United States Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis. During 2019, we completed the remediation measures related to the material weakness and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019.\nCompletion of remediation does not provide assurance that our remediation or other controls will continue to operate properly. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to record, process and report financial information accurately, and to prepare financial statements within required time periods could be adversely affected, which could subject us to litigation or investigations requiring management resources and payment of legal and other expenses, negatively affect investor confidence in our financial statements and adversely impact our stock price. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or when required in the future, if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an unqualified opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected and we could become subject to litigation or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nAs a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting, and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020, which is the year covered by the second annual report following the completion of our IPO. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm will be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our first annual report required to be filed with the SEC following the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We have recently commenced the costly and challenging process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404, but we may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion once initiated. Our compliance with Section 404 will require that we incur substantial accounting expenses and expend significant management efforts. We currently do not have an internal audit group, and we will need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge and compile the system and process documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404.\nDuring the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to certify that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nFuture sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that such sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nAll of our directors and officers and the holders of substantially all of our capital stock and securities convertible into our capital stock are subject to lock-up agreements that restrict their ability to transfer shares of our capital stock through the end of the day on April 21, 2020. These lock-up agreements limit the number of shares of capital stock that may be sold immediately following our IPO. Subject to certain limitations, substantially all of these shares will become eligible for sale upon expiration of the 180-day lock-up period. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC and BofA Securities, Inc. may, in their sole discretion, permit our stockholders who are subject to these lock-up agreements to sell shares prior to the expiration of the lock-up agreements.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2019, there were an aggregate of 15,721,139 shares of our common stock subject to outstanding options, and we have registered all of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options or other equity awards we may grant in the future, for public resale under the Securities Act. Accordingly, these shares will be eligible for sale in the public market to the extent such options are exercised, subject to the lock-up agreements described above and compliance with applicable securities laws.\nFurther, holders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering the sale of their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders.\nOur issuance of additional capital stock in connection with financings, acquisitions, investments, our equity incentive plans or otherwise will dilute all other stockholders.\nWe expect to issue additional capital stock in the future that will result in dilution to all other stockholders. We expect to grant equity awards to employees, directors and consultants under our equity incentive plans. We may also raise capital through equity financings in the future. As part of our business strategy, we may acquire or make investments in businesses, joint ventures, products and services, or technologies and issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition or investment. Any such issuances of additional capital stock may cause stockholders to experience significant dilution of their ownership interests and the per share value of our common stock to decline.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, or publish unfavorable or inaccurate research, about our business, the market price and trading volume of our common stock could decline.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock will be heavily influenced by the way analysts interpret our financial information and other disclosures. We do not have control over these analysts. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if industry analysts cease coverage of us, our stock price would be negatively affected. If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, downgrade our common stock, or\npublish negative reports about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price to decline and could decrease the trading volume of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future and, as a result, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock, and we do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Accordingly, you may need to rely on sales of our common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on your investment.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Pursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company, we have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. As a result, our consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of issuers who are required to comply with the effective dates for new or revised accounting standards that are applicable to public companies, which may make our common stock less attractive to investors. In addition, if we cease to be an emerging growth company, we will no longer be able to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) December 31, 2024; (2) the last day of our first fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion; (3) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period; and (4) the last day of our first fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the prior June 30th.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. For example, if we do not adopt a new or revised accounting standard, our future results of operations may not be as comparable to the results of operations of certain other companies in our industry that adopted such standards. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance with our public company responsibilities and corporate governance practices.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, which we expect to further increase after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq Stock Market, or Nasdaq, and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to compliance with these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time- consuming and costly. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we will incur as a public company or the specific timing of such costs.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u00b7\nauthorize our Board of Directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, shares of undesignated preferred stock with terms, rights, and preferences determined by our Board of Directors that may be senior to our common stock;\n\u00b7\nrequire that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n\u00b7\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our Board of Directors, the chairperson of our Board of Directors, or our chief executive officer;\n\u00b7\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our Board of Directors;\n\u00b7\nestablish that our Board of Directors is divided into three classes, with each class serving three-year staggered terms;\n\u00b7\nprohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u00b7\nprovide that our directors may be removed for cause only upon the vote of at least 662/3% of our outstanding shares of voting stock;\n\u00b7\nprovide that vacancies on our Board of Directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; and\n\u00b7\nrequire the approval of our Board of Directors or the holders of at least 662/3% of our outstanding shares of voting stock to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder. Any of the foregoing provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, and they could deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you would receive a premium for your shares of our common stock in an acquisition.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the state courts in the State of Delaware or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, any state court located within the State of Delaware, or if all such state courts\nlack jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (2) any action asserting a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee, to us or our stockholders; (3) any action or proceeding asserting a claim against us or any of our current or former directors, officers or other employees, arising out of or pursuant to any provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws; (4) or any action or proceeding to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; (5) any action or proceeding as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; or (6) any action asserting a claim against us, or any of our directors, officers or other employees, that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court\u2019s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. For the avoidance of doubt, these choice of forum provisions will not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nThese choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees and may discourage these types of lawsuits. Furthermore, if a court were to find the choice of forum provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.", "PERMNO": 18968, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "PGNY"}
