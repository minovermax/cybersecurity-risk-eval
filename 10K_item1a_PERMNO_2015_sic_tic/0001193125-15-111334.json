RISK FACTORS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis report contains statements that may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe-harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, such as statements other than historical facts contained or incorporated by reference in this report. These forward-looking statements include statements with respect to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business, including statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d or \u201canticipates,\u201d references to estimates or similar expressions. Future filings by us with the SEC, and future statements other than historical facts contained in written material, press releases and oral statements issued by us, or on our behalf, may also constitute forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause actual results to differ from the results discussed above include, but are not limited to, the Risk Factors set forth below and any other risks identified in this report or in other filings we may make with the SEC. All forward-looking statements contained in this report or which may be contained in future statements made for or on our behalf are based upon information available at the time the statement is made and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.\nRisk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock contains a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information contained in, or incorporated by reference into, this Form 10-K, including the matters addressed under the caption \u201cForward Looking Statements\u201d above, you should carefully consider the risks described below before deciding whether to invest in our common stock. If any of the events highlighted in the following risks actually occur, or if additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we do not currently believe to be important to you, materialize, our business, results of operations or financial condition would likely suffer. In such an event, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in our filings with the SEC, including our financial statements and related notes.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are subject to specific market risks due to our focus on agricultural lending.\nWe primarily concentrate our lending activities in the state of Wisconsin, which is to some extent dominated by an agricultural economy. Historically, our senior management\u2019s primary business lending experience has been in agricultural lending, with a specific expertise in and focus\non dairy and dairy-related businesses. Although we attempt to maintain a diversified customer base and a diversified loan portfolio, we are more heavily dependent upon the agricultural economy than a typical commercial bank. At December 31, 2014, agricultural loans comprised $415 million, or approximately 64.1% of our total loan portfolio.\nThe agricultural economy is subject to certain risks that are either inherently volatile or are beyond our ability, or the ability of farmers or other participants in the agricultural economy, to predict or control. Some of these risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nWeather-Related Risks. Severe weather, including such things as drought, hail, excessive rain or other natural disasters, could impact the quantity and quality of feed necessary to support our borrowers\u2019 dairy operations and, in turn, increase their expenses. If significant adverse weather-related events occur, it could impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or impair the value of collateral securing loans and cause significant property damage, which could either result in loss of revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses;\n\u2022\nDisease-Related Risks. The operations of our dairy farm and dairy-related borrowers depend primarily on their cattle. If the livestock were to contract an illness or disease, the borrowers would incur additional expenses, and the viability of their operations may be compromised if the disease is not properly managed. The existence of a widespread livestock disease or pandemic could have a significant impact on our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay outstanding loans or impair the value of collateral securing loans, which could either result in loss of revenue or cause us to incur additional expenses;\n\u2022\nReal Property Value. Our dairy farm and dairy-related borrowers tend to grow and produce much of their feed as opposed to purchasing it from third parties, unlike many dairy farmers in other parts of the country. While this means they are often less subject to fluctuations in feed prices, they require more land. Accordingly, declines in real property values in the areas in which we operate could result in a deterioration of the credit quality of our borrowers or an increase in the number of loan delinquencies, default and charge-offs, and could reduce the value of any collateral we realize following a default on agricultural loans;\n\u2022\nMarket Prices. Agricultural markets are sensitive to real and perceived changes in supply and demand of agricultural products, and given that approximately 90% of our agricultural lending is to dairy farms, the credit quality of a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is closely related to the performance of, and supply and demand in, this sub-sector of the agricultural market. For example, the success of a dairy operation hinges in large part on the cost of feed and the price of milk. When feed costs are high and milk prices are low, it places a strain on our dairy borrowers\u2019 business, which may impair their ability to repay their outstanding loans to us.\n\u2022\nGovernmental Policies and Regulations. Our agricultural loans are dependent on the profitable operation and management of the farm properties securing the loans and their cash flows, and government policies and regulations (including the availability of price supports for crops and other agricultural products (in particular, milk), subsidies, or government-sponsored crop insurance) are outside the control of our borrowers and may affect the successful operation of a farm.\nOur focus on local markets and agricultural lending creates credit concentration risks.\nCredit concentration risk is primarily related to the risk that a borrower will not be able to repay some or all of its obligations to us. Concentrations of credit risk occur when the aggregate amount owed by one borrower, a group of related borrowers, or borrowers within the same or related markets, industries or groups, represent a relatively large percentage of the total capital or total credit extended by a bank. Although each loan in a concentration may be of sound quality, concentration risks represent a risk not present when the same loan amounts are extended to a more diversified group of borrowers. Loans concentrated in one borrower depend, to a large degree, upon the financial capability and character of the individual borrower. Loans made to a group of related borrowers can be susceptible to financial problems experienced by one or a few members of that group. Loans made to borrowers that are part of the same or related industries or groups, or that are located in the same market area, can all be adversely impacted with respect to their ability to repay some or all of their obligations when adverse conditions prevail in the broader economy generally, in the market specifically or even within just the respective industries or groups. For example, lenders who focused on certain types of real estate lending experienced greater financial difficulties during the recent recession than more diversified lenders or those with concentrations other than real estate lending.\nOur lending is primarily to borrowers located or doing business in Wisconsin. Furthermore, at December 31, 2014, we had certain loan-type concentrations of credit risk, specifically in agricultural lending, which are described in more detail in the section of this Form 10-K entitled \u201cBusiness-Lending Activities\u201d and \u201cBusiness-Market.\u201d Because of the concentration of agricultural loans in our lending portfolio and the volume of our borrowers in regions dependent upon agriculture, we could be disproportionately affected relative to others because these high concentrations present a risk to our lending operations. If any of these borrowers becomes unable to repay their loan obligations for any reason, our nonperforming loans and our allowance for loan losses could increase significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent on local economy, and a regional or local economic downturn affecting Wisconsin may magnify the adverse effects and consequences to us.\nWe operate as a community-oriented business bank, with a focus on servicing both business customers and individuals in our market areas, which include our headquarters in Manitowoc, a full-service branch in Stevens Point, and a loan production office in each of Eau Claire, Fond du Lac and Darlington. Although we have a primary focus on agricultural and business banking, future growth opportunities will depend\nlargely on market area penetration, market area growth and our ability to compete for traditional banking business within our market areas. We anticipate that as a result of this concentration, a downturn in the general economy in our market areas, including Wisconsin specifically, could increase the risk of loss associated with our loan portfolio. Although economic conditions in our markets have been generally stronger than those in other regions of the country recently, there can be no assurance that such conditions will continue to prevail.\nVolatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2014, approximately 64.1% of our total loan portfolio was comprised of agricultural loans. Volatility in certain commodity prices, including milk, could adversely impact the ability of those borrowers to perform under the terms of their borrowing arrangements with us. In terms of the dairy industry, milk prices have fluctuated. For the 15-year period ended November 30, 2014, the per-year average All-Milk price (a weighted average price of all uses of milk in a particular milk order) in the United States paid to producers has ranged from an average low price of $12.32 per hundred weight (cwt) in 2000 to an average high price of $24.34 per cwt in 2014 year-to-date through November 30, 2014, according to the USDA National Agricultural Statistics. \u201cHundredweight\u201d or \u201ccwt\u201d is a measure equal to 100 pounds of milk shipped. A decrease in milk prices may result in an increase in the number of non-performing loans in our agricultural portfolio, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, earnings and capital.\nOur business is significantly dependent on the real estate markets where we operate, as a large portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate.\nAt December 31, 2014, approximately 64% of our aggregate loan portfolio, comprising our agriculture real estate loans (including agricultural construction loans), commercial real estate loans and residential real estate loans, was primarily secured by interests in real estate predominantly located in Wisconsin. Additionally, some of our other lending occasionally involves taking real estate as primary or secondary collateral. Real property values in Wisconsin may be different from, and in some instances worse than, real property values in other markets or in the United States as a whole, and may be affected by a variety of factors outside our control and the control of our borrowers, including national and local economic conditions generally. Declines in real property prices, including prices for farmland, commercial property and homes in Wisconsin could result in a deterioration of the credit quality of our borrowers, an increase in the number of loan delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs, and reduced demand for our products and services generally. Moreover, declines in real property values in Wisconsin could reduce the value of any collateral we realize following a default on these loans and could adversely affect our ability to continue to grow our loan portfolio consistent with our underwriting standards. Our failure to effectively mitigate these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or result of operations.\nStrong competition could hurt our earnings and slow growth.\nWe face intense competition in making loans and attracting deposits. Price competition for loans and deposits sometimes results in us charging lower interest rates on our loans and paying higher interest rates on our deposits, which may reduce our net interest income. Competition also makes it more difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees. Many of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. We also face competition for agricultural loans from participants in the nationwide Farm Credit System and much larger regional, national and global banks. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of non-bank competition in the financial services industry. If we are not able to effectively compete in our market areas and targeted business segments, our profitability may be negatively affected.\nOur ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business, and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance.\nWe have benefited from strong relationships with our customers, and also from our relationships with financial intermediaries. As a result, our reputation is an important component of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to leverage our reputation for customer service and knowledge of our customers\u2019 needs and business to expand our presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in and outside of our local market areas. We strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. We aim to enhance our reputation, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities and markets we serve, who are able to connect with customers through on-site visits and knowledge of our customers\u2019 business, and who care about and deliver superior service to our customers. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or by events beyond our control, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans generally carry greater credit risk than loans secured by owner occupied one-to-four family real estate, and our credit risk may increase if we succeed in our plan to increase our commercial lending.\nAt December 31, 2014, $191.3 million, or approximately 29.5%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. Given their generally larger balances and the complexity of the underlying collateral, commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans generally expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by owner occupied one-to-four family real\nestate. For commercial real estate loans, the principal risk is that repayment is generally dependent on income from tenant leases being generated in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service. For commercial and industrial loans, the principal risk is that repayment is generally dependent upon the successful operation of the borrower\u2019s business. If loans that are collateralized by real estate or other business assets become troubled and the value of the collateral has been significantly impaired, then we may not be able to recover the full contractual amount of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loan, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses and would adversely affect our operating results.\nChanges in interest rates may hurt our earnings and asset value.\nLike other financial institutions, we are subject to interest rate risk. Our primary source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments (consisting primarily of loans and securities) and the interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities (consisting primarily of deposits and borrowings). Changes in both the general level of interest rates and in the difference between short-term and long-term rates can affect our net interest income. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including government monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control.\nWhile we pursue an asset/liability strategy designed to mitigate our risk from changes in interest rates, including by seeking to originate variable rate loans and balancing the respective terms of assets and liabilities, changes in interest rates may still have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect our ability to originate loans, the value of our assets and liabilities and our ability to realize gains from the sale of our assets, all of which could affect our earnings.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings and capital could decrease.\nAt December 31, 2014, our allowance for loan losses, totaled $10.6 million, which represented 1.64% of gross loans. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate other factors including, among other things, current economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, or if delinquencies or non-performing loans increase, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which would require additions to our allowance, and could decrease our net income or reduce our capital.\nIn addition, our regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase the allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to expense, or to charge off loans, which, net of any recoveries, would decrease the allowance for loan losses. Any such additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe dividend rate on our SBLF Preferred Stock will increase to 9.0% during the first quarter of 2016 if we have not redeemed the SBLF Preferred Stock, which would impact the net income available to holders of our common stock and earnings per share of our common stock.\nThe per annum dividend rate on the 15,000 shares of our Series C Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, no par value (the \u201cSBLF Preferred Stock\u201d) we sold to the U.S. Department of Treasury (the \u201cU.S. Treasury\u201d) in connection with our participation in the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Small Business Lending Fund (the \u201cSBLF Program\u201d) is currently 1.0%. During the first quarter of 2016, the per annum dividend rate will increase to a fixed rate of 9.0% if any SBLF Preferred Stock remains outstanding at that time. The total dividends paid on our SBLF Preferred Stock for each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 were $150,000, respectively. Assuming the increased dividend rate of 9.0% per annum and assuming we have not redeemed any of our SBLF Preferred Stock, the total dividends payable on our SBLF Preferred Stock would be $1.3 million for the 12-month period beginning in February 2016. Depending on our financial condition at the time, any such increase in the dividend rate could have a material negative effect on our financial condition, including reducing our net income available to holders of our common stock and our earnings per share.\nFailure to pay dividends on our SBLF Preferred Stock may have negative consequences, including limiting our ability to pay dividends in the future.\nOur SBLF Preferred Stock pays a noncumulative quarterly dividend in arrears. Such dividends are not cumulative but we may only declare and pay dividends on our common stock (or any other equity securities junior to the SBLF Preferred Stock) if we have declared and paid dividends on the SBLF Preferred Stock for the current dividend period. Moreover, our ability to pay dividends is always subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. Any payment of dividends in the future will depend, in large part, on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by the our board of directors. There is no assurance that we will pay dividends on our common stock in the future, or that if we do pay dividends that such dividends will continue.\nWe rely on the accuracy and completeness of information about our customers and counterparties, and inaccurate or incomplete information could subject us to various risks.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with our customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We may also rely on representations as to the accuracy and completeness of such information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors.\nWhile we strive to verify the accuracy and sufficiency of such information, if this information is inaccurate or incomplete, we may be subject to loan losses, regulatory action, reputational harm, or other adverse effects on the operation of our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe depend on our management team to implement our business strategy and on our relationship managers to maintain and grow our agricultural and commercial relationships; we could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nWe are dependent upon the services and expertise of our founders and the other members of our management team who direct our strategy and operations, especially relating to our agricultural lending focus, and, we have benefited from our management\u2019s extensive banking knowledge and experience in this regard. We also rely heavily upon the talents, experience and customer relationships of our loan officers and have benefited from their expertise and relationship-building skills, especially with respect to our agricultural and commercial lending. Members of our executive management team and our seasoned loan officers could be difficult to replace. Our loss of the services of one or more of these persons, or our inability to hire additional qualified personnel, could impact our ability to implement our business strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nLimits on our ability to use brokered deposits as part of our funding strategy may adversely affect our ability to grow.\nA \u201cbrokered deposit\u201d is any deposit that is obtained from or through the mediation or assistance of a deposit broker, which includes larger correspondent banks and securities brokerage firms. These deposit brokers attract deposits from individuals and companies throughout the country and internationally whose deposit decisions are based almost exclusively on obtaining the highest interest rates. We have used brokered deposits in the past, and we intend to continue to use brokered deposits as one of our funding sources to support future growth. At December 31, 2014, brokered deposits represented approximately 20.7% of our total deposits and equaled $125.4 million. There are risks associated with using brokered deposits. In order to continue to maintain our level of brokered deposits, we may be forced to pay higher interest rates than contemplated by our asset-liability pricing strategy. In addition, banks that become less than \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under applicable regulatory capital requirements may be restricted in their ability to accept or prohibited from accepting brokered deposits. If this funding source becomes more difficult to access, we will have to seek alternative funding sources in order to continue to fund our growth. This may include increasing our reliance on the FHLB borrowings, attempting to attract non-brokered deposits, reducing our available for sale securities portfolio and selling loans. There can be no assurance that brokered deposits will be available, or if available, sufficient to support our continued growth.\nA lack of liquidity could adversely affect our ability to fund operations and meet our obligations as they become due.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. Liquidity risk is the potential that we will be unable to meet our obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding. The primary sources of our liquidity are customer deposits and loan repayments, in addition to borrowings. Our access to deposits and other funding sources in adequate amounts and on acceptable terms is affected by a number of factors, including rates paid by competitors, returns available to customers on alternative investments and general economic conditions. Any decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, pay dividends to our shareholders, or to fulfill obligations such as repaying our borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on all business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives relating to our financial and accounting systems, procedures and controls in order to satisfy our new public company reporting requirements.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, and these expenses may increase even more after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a stand-alone public company, and we expect that the obligations of being a public company, including the substantial public reporting obligations, will require significant expenditures and place additional demands on our management team. These obligations increase our operating expenses and could divert management\u2019s attention from other aspects of our business. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Dodd-Frank Act, as well as rules adopted, and to be adopted, by the SEC, and the NASDAQ Global Market, except for such requirements that we may elect not to comply with during the period we are an emerging growth company, which could require us to further upgrade our systems and/or hire additional staff, which would increase our operating costs. Our management and other personnel need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, we expect these rules and regulations to substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly. The increased costs may cause us to incur losses. We cannot predict or estimate the amount or timing of additional costs we may incur to respond to these requirements. The impact of these requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nWe are dependent on our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party service providers, and systems failures, interruptions or breaches of security could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation.\nOur business is highly dependent on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party service providers. We outsource many of our major systems, such as data processing and deposit processing systems. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. If sustained or repeated, a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to provide customer service, compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business and/or subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, we provide our customers the ability to bank remotely, including online over the internet. The secure transmission of confidential information is a critical element of remote banking. Our network could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, phishing schemes, spam attacks, human error, natural disasters, power loss and other security breaches. We may be required to spend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches and computer viruses, or to alleviate problems caused by these incidents. Further, we outsource some of the data processing functions used for remote banking, and accordingly we are dependent on the expertise and performance of our third-party providers. To the extent that our activities, the activities of our customers, or the activities of our third-party service providers involve the storage and transmission of confidential information, security breaches and viruses could expose us to claims, litigation and other possible liabilities. Any inability to prevent security breaches or computer viruses could also cause existing customers to lose confidence in our systems and could adversely affect our reputation, results of operations and ability to attract and maintain customers and businesses. In addition, a security breach could also subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability and cause reputational damage, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on other companies to provide certain key components of our business infrastructure.\nThird-party service providers provide certain key components of our business infrastructure, such as data processing and deposit processing systems, mobile payment systems, internet connections, and network access. While we have selected these third-party service providers carefully, we do not control their operations. Any failure by these third parties to perform or provide agreed-upon goods and services for any reason or their poor performance of services, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and otherwise to conduct our business. Replacing these third-party service providers could also entail significant delay and expense.\nWe may face risks with respect to future acquisitions.\nIf we attempt to expand our business in Wisconsin or other states through mergers and acquisitions, we anticipate that we will seek targets that are culturally similar to us, have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through economies of scale or expanded services. In addition to the general risks associated with our growth plans, acquiring other banks, businesses or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisition and merger targets;\n\u2022\nunexpected delays, complications or expenses resulting from regulatory approval requirements or other conditions to closing;\n\u2022\ninaccuracies in the estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risks with respect to the target institution;\n\u2022\nthe time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring experienced local management, and the time lags between these activities and the generation of sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion;\n\u2022\nour ability to finance an acquisition and possible dilution to our existing shareholders;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management\u2019s attention to the negotiation of a transaction;\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of an impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and adverse effects on our results of operations;\n\u2022\nentry into new markets where we lack experience; and\n\u2022\nrisks associated with integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt existing customer relationships or result in decreased revenues resulting from any loss of customers.\nWith respect to the risks particularly associated with the integration of an acquired business, we may encounter a number of difficulties, such as: (1) customer loss and revenue loss; (2) the loss of key employees; (3) the disruption of our operations and business; (4) our inability to maintain and increase competitive presence; (5) possible inconsistencies in standards, control procedures and policies; and/or (6) unexpected problems with costs, operations, personnel, technology and credit.\nIn addition to the risks posed by the integration process itself, the focus of management\u2019s attention and effort on integration may result in a lack of sufficient management attention to other important issues, causing harm to our business. Also, general market and economic conditions or governmental actions affecting the financial industry generally may inhibit our successful integration of an acquired business.\nWe expect to continue to evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities that are presented to us and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur at any time. We do not expect to comment publicly on possible acquisitions or business combinations until we have signed a definitive agreement for the transaction. Historically, acquisitions of non-failed financial institutions involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our book value and net income per share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIf we fail to successfully keep pace with technological change, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry generally, and virtual banking in particular, could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nUpon completion of our initial public offering, we became subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. We designed our disclosure controls and procedures to reasonably assure that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected and any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer losses.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. We have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor and report the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit risk, operations risk, compliance risk, reputation risk, strategic risk, market risk and liquidity risk. We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a framework of policies, procedures, monitoring and reporting requirements. There may be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nFinancial reform legislation will result in new regulations that are expected to increase our costs of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the WDFI. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations or legislation, could have a material impact on us and our operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act was enacted on July 21, 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act represented a significant overhaul of many aspects of the regulation of the financial-services industry. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act created a new federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, tightened capital standards, and generally increased oversight and regulation of financial institutions and financial activities.\nIn addition to the self-implementing provisions of the statute, the Dodd-Frank Act calls for more than 300 administrative rulemakings by various federal agencies to implement various parts of the legislation. While some rules have been finalized or issued in proposed form, many have yet to be proposed. It is impossible to predict when additional rules will be issued or finalized, and what the content of such rules will be. We\nwill have to apply resources to ensure that we are in compliance with all applicable provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and any implementing rules, which may increase our costs of operations and adversely impact our earnings. The Dodd-Frank Act and any implementing rules that are ultimately issued could have adverse implications on the financial industry, the competitive environment, and/or our ability to conduct business.\nWe will become subject to more stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares.\nIn July 2013, each of the U.S. federal banking agencies adopted final rules implementing the recommendations of the International Basel Committee on Bank Supervision to strengthen the regulatory capital requirements of all banking organizations in the United States. The new capital framework, referred to as Basel III, will replace the existing regulatory capital rules for all banks, savings associations and U.S. bank holding companies with greater than $500 million in total assets, and all savings and loan holding companies. The final Basel III rules became effective for the Company and Bank on January 1, 2015, and the rules will be fully phased-in by January 1, 2019.\nBasel III creates a new regulatory capital standard based on Tier 1 common equity and increases the minimum leverage and risk-based capital ratios applicable to all banking organizations. Basel III also changes how a number of the regulatory capital components are calculated. Any significant increase in our capital requirements could reduce our growth and profitability and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. For more information about the regulations to which we are subject, see the section of this Form 10-K entitled \u201cSupervision and Regulation.\u201d\nOur growth or future losses may require us to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed or the cost of that capital may be very high.\nWe are required by our regulators to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. We believe the net proceeds that we raised in our initial public offering are sufficient to permit the Bank to maintain regulatory capital compliance for the foreseeable future. Nonetheless, we may at some point need to raise additional capital to support continued growth or to address losses.\nOur ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and on our financial condition and performance. Accordingly, we may not be able to raise additional capital if needed on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, our operations and our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to raise additional capital when required by the Federal Reserve, we may be subject to adverse regulatory action.\nIncreased FDIC insurance assessments could significantly increase our expenses.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the maximum Deposit Insurance Fund ratio of 1.5% of estimated deposits, and the FDIC has established a long-term ratio of 2.0%. The FDIC has the authority to increase assessments in order to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund ratio at particular levels. In addition, if our regulators issue downgraded ratings of the Bank in connection with their examinations, the FDIC could impose significant additional fees and assessments on us which could significantly increase our expenses.\nWe face a risk of noncompliance with and enforcement actions under the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations.\nWe maintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we comply with applicable laws and regulations. The federal Bank Secrecy Act, the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the PATRIOT Act, and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The federal Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, established by the U.S. Treasury to administer the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and Internal Revenue Service. Federal and state bank regulators also have begun to focus on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain aspects of our business plan, including future acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.\nChanges in accounting standards and policies may negatively affect our performance.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. From time to time there are changes in the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we report and record our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised accounting standard retroactively, which could have a negative impact on our reported results.\nOur ability to pay dividends is dependent upon the Bank\u2019s performance.\nThe Company\u2019s only source of funds to pay dividends is dividends or other distributions it may receive directly from the Bank. The Company\u2019s payment of dividends in the future, if any, will be subject to legal, regulatory and contractual restrictions (including with respect to our SBLF Preferred Stock and junior subordinated debentures (and related trust preferred securities (\u201cTruPS\u201d)), which are senior to our shares of preferred and common stock and have a preference on dividends), and will also depend on the Bank\u2019s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by our board of directors. Dividends are payable on shares at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to the provisions of the WBCL, and any regulatory restrictions.\nWe are subject to examinations and challenges by tax authorities that may be costly and time-consuming and may require expensive remedial action or other costs.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company and the Bank are routinely subject to examinations and challenges from federal and state tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due in connection with investments that both entities have made and the businesses in which they have engaged. Federal and state taxing authorities have over the past few years become increasingly aggressive in challenging tax positions taken by financial institutions. These tax positions may relate to tax compliance, sales and use, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property and income tax issues, including tax base, apportionment and tax credit planning. The challenges made by tax authorities may result in adjustments to the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. If not resolved in our favor, such challenges could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to an Investment in Our Common Stock\nThere may be a limited trading market in our common stock, which would hinder your ability to sell our common stock and may lower the market price of the stock.\nIn January 2015, our common stock was listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol \u201cICBK\u201d. The development of an active trading market depends on the existence of willing buyers and sellers, the presence of which is not within our control, or that of any market maker. The number of active buyers and sellers of the shares of common stock at any particular time may be limited. Under such circumstances, you could have difficulty selling your shares of common stock on short notice, and, therefore, you should not view the shares of common stock as a short-term investment. In addition, our public \u201cfloat,\u201d which is the total number of our outstanding shares less shares held by our directors and executive officers, if any, may be quite limited. As a result, it is unlikely that an active trading market for the common stock will develop or that, if it develops, it will continue. If you purchase shares of common stock, you may not be able to sell them at a price equal to or in excess of your per share purchase price. Purchasers of our common stock should have long-term investment intent and should recognize that there is a limited trading market in the common stock. The limited market for our stock may make it difficult to sell the common stock and may have an adverse impact on the price at which the common stock can be sold.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Wisconsin law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our shareholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the shareholders, up to 570,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\u2022\nestablish an advance notice procedure for shareholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of our shareholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022\nestablish that our board of directors is divided into two to three classes, with each class serving staggered three year terms;\n\u2022\nprovide that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum; and\n\u2022\nspecify that no shareholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our shareholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for shareholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Wisconsin, the Wisconsin control share acquisition statute and Wisconsin\u2019s \u201cfair price\u201d and \u201cbusiness combination\u201d provisions, in addition to other provisions of Wisconsin law, would apply and limit the ability of an acquiring person to engage in certain transactions or to exercise the full voting power of acquired shares under certain circumstances. As a result, offers to acquire us, which may represent a premium over the available market price of our common stock, may be withdrawn or otherwise fail to be realized.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act and are able to avail ourselves of reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFor so long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various requirements applicable to public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including:\n\u2022\nthe provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that our independent registered public accounting firm audit the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\nthe \u201csay on pay\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding shareholder vote to approve compensation of certain executive officers) and the \u201csay on golden parachute\u201d provisions (requiring a non-binding shareholder vote to approve golden parachute arrangements for certain executive officers in connection with mergers and certain other business combinations) of the Dodd-Frank Act and some of the disclosure requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act relating to compensation of our chief executive officer;\n\u2022\nthe requirement to provide detailed compensation discussion and analysis in proxy statements and reports filed under the Exchange Act and instead provide a reduced level of disclosure concerning executive compensation; and\n\u2022\nany rules that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the \u201cPCAOB\u201d), may adopt requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report on the financial statements.\nWe may take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d upon the earliest of: (i) the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial offering; (ii) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are $1 billion or more; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or (iv) as of the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile and may decline.\nOur common stock is equity and is subordinate to our existing and any future indebtedness.\nShares of our common stock represent equity interests in us and do not constitute indebtedness. Accordingly, the shares of our common stock are subordinate to our existing junior subordinated debentures with respect to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation and rank junior to all of our existing and future indebtedness and to other non-equity claims against us with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against us, including in our liquidation.\nOur board of directors may issue shares of preferred stock that would adversely affect the rights of our common shareholders.\nOur authorized capital stock includes 600,000 shares of preferred stock, which includes: (i) 15,000 shares of Series B Nonvoting Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (\u201cSeries B Preferred Stock\u201d) that are authorized, of which 8,000 shares are outstanding; (ii) 15,000 shares of our SBLF Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury under the SBLF Program that are issued and outstanding; and (iii) 570,000 shares of Preferred Stock that are not classified. Our SBLF Preferred Stock has rights that may be adverse to our common shareholders, including priority with regard to any dividends paid by the Company and any payment received in liquidation. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, may designate and issue one or more series of preferred stock from the authorized and unissued shares of preferred stock. Subject to limitations imposed by law or our articles of incorporation, our board of directors is empowered to determine:\n\u2022\nthe designation of, and the number of, shares constituting each series of preferred stock;\n\u2022\nthe dividend rate for each series;\n\u2022\nthe terms and conditions of any voting, conversion and exchange rights for each series;\n\u2022\nthe amounts payable on each series on redemption or our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up;\n\u2022\nthe provisions of any sinking fund for the redemption or purchase of shares of any series; and\n\u2022\nthe preferences and the relative rights among the series of preferred stock.\nWe could issue preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the shares of our common stock and with preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends and in liquidation.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nStock price volatility may negatively impact the price at which our common stock may be sold, and may also negatively impact the timing of any sale. Our stock price may fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors including the risk factors described herein and, among other things:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nrecommendations by securities analysts, including estimates of our financial performance or lack of research and reports by industry analysts;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\nnews reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry, such as cyber-attacks;\n\u2022\nnew technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u2022\nvariations in milk or other commodity prices;\n\u2022\nperceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors;\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nfailure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions;\n\u2022\nadditional investments from third parties;\n\u2022\nissuance of additional shares of stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations; or\n\u2022\ngeo-political conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism, pandemics or military conflicts.\nGeneral market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes, credit loss trends or currency fluctuations, could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of our operating results.\nShares of our common stock are not insured deposits and may lose value.\nShares of our common stock are not insured deposits or other obligations of any bank and are not insured by the FDIC or any other governmental agency and are subject to investment risk, including possible loss of principal.\nSecurities analysts may not initiate or continue coverage on our common stock.\nThe trading price of our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities analysts publish about us and our business. We do not have any control over these securities analysts, and they may not cover our common stock. If securities analysts do not cover our common stock, the lack of research coverage may adversely affect our common stock\u2019s market price. If we are covered by securities analysts, and our common stock is the subject of an unfavorable report, the price of our common stock may decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover us or fail to publish regular reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the price or trading volume of our common stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 15180, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "ICBK"}
