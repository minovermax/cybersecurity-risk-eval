Risk Factors\nThis report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this report. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this report and in any documents incorporated in this report by reference.\nIf any of the following risks, or other risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe to not be significant, develop into actual events, then our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially adversely affected. If that happens, the market price of our common stock could decline, and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe may change our plans for the development of solithromycin for the treatment of CABP or any of our other drug candidates or any of the indications we are pursuing for our drug candidates.\nIn late December, the FDA issued a complete response letter, or CRL, to our NDAs for solithromycin for the treatment of CABP. The FDA issues complete response letters to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval in its present form. The FDA determined that the risk of hepatotoxicity of solithromycin had not been adequately characterized. The FDA noted the size of the safety database is limited to 920 patients who received solithromycin at the proposed dose and duration, and is too small to adequately characterize the nature and frequency of serious hepatic adverse effects. To address this deficiency, the FDA is recommending a comparative study to evaluate the safety of solithromycin in patients with CABP. Specifically, the CRL recommends that we consider a study of approximately 9,000 patients exposed to solithromycin to enable exclusion of serious drug induced liver injury, or DILI, events occurring at a rate of approximately 1:3000 with a 95% probability. In addition, the CRL noted that while the FDA reserves comment on the proposed labeling until the NDAs are otherwise adequate, even in the absence of a case of Hy\u2019s Law or of another form of serious DILI in future studies, labeling will need to include adequate information about the potential for hepatotoxicity, limiting use to patients who have limited therapeutic options and limitations regarding duration of therapy. A comprehensive plan for post-marketing safety assessment including an enhanced pharmacovigilance program will also be required. Further, the CRL stated that during recent inspections of the Wockhardt and Hospira manufacturing facilities, the FDA field investigator conveyed deficiencies to representatives of the facilities. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required prior to approval of the NDAs. Details on these deficiencies were not provided in the CRL.\nWhile we have met with the FDA to obtain more clarity on the findings in the CRL, additional meetings will be required. In addition, the work to address the manufacturing issues could be lengthy and costly and is not within our control. Further, we are assessing the implications of the label warning on the marketability of solithromycin. In light of this, we are still determining the future of our development program for solithromycin. Depending on our resources, as well as any further insight into responding to the CRL and the development plans for solithromycin, including the cost and duration of responding to the CRL, as well as the anticipated market for solithromycin, we may choose to alter, reduce or terminate our development plans for solithromycin.\nGiven our need to conserve resources, we could change our plans for the other indications we are pursuing for solithromycin or our plans and research and development activities for any of our other product candidates.\nGiven the uncertainty at this time regarding our development plans for our drug product candidates, the other risks cited in this Section 1A generally do not reflect any possible changes to our current development plans for those product candidates. Consequently, the other risk factors should not be understood to indicate any decision by us to necessarily continue with our current development plans.\nWe may not realize the expected benefits of our recently initiated cost-saving initiatives.\nAs a result of the receipt of the CRL and the resulting uncertainty regarding our development plans for solithromycin, reducing costs to conserve our financial resources is a key focus of our management. In late February 2017, we initiated a reduction to our workforce. Personnel reductions were initiated across our entire organization that have resulted in a remaining workforce of 45 full-time employees. The principal objective of the reduction in workforce is to enable us to conserve our financial resources as we determine whether and how to respond to the CRL, as well as determine the future of the other indications we are pursuing for solithromycin and the development programs for our other drug candidates.\nWe expect to record an aggregate charge related to one-time termination benefits of approximately $3.5 million to be recorded in the first quarter of 2017. If we experience unanticipated inefficiencies or incremental costs in connection with restructuring activities, such as unanticipated inefficiencies or other negative impacts caused by reducing headcount, we may be unable to\nmeaningfully realize our expected cost savings and we may incur expenses in excess of what we anticipate. Either of these outcomes could prevent us from meeting our strategic objectives and could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may undertake additional cost-saving initiatives, but there is a risk that we might not achieve the desired savings and efficiencies with any future initiatives. Further, the termination of any program we currently are pursuing could result in termination fees and other fixed costs that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur efforts to explore external late-stage assets and other potential strategic business opportunities to determine the best use of our resources and clinical programs to deliver value to patients and shareholders may not result in any definitive transaction or deliver the expected benefits, and may create a distraction for our management and uncertainty that may adversely affect our operating results and business.\nIn February 2017, as a consequence of the solithromycin CRL we received, and subsequent discussions with the FDA, resulting in the delay of the potential approval of solithromycin, we initiated companywide cost and personnel reductions. The principal objective of the reductions is to enable us to conserve our financial resources as we evaluate our path forward on our existing pipeline and potential business development opportunities. No timetable has been set for completion of this evaluation process, and there can be no assurance that any transaction will result. Strategic alternatives we may pursue could include, but are not limited to, joint ventures or partnering or other collaboration agreements, licensing arrangements, or another transaction intended to maximize shareholder value, such as a merger, a sale of our company or some or all of its assets, or another strategic transaction. There can be no assurance that the exploration of strategic alternatives will result in any agreements or transactions, or that, if completed, any agreements or transactions will be successful or on attractive terms.\nThere are various uncertainties and risks relating to our evaluation and negotiation of possible strategic alternatives and our ability to consummate a definitive transaction, including:\n\u2022\nexpected benefits may not be successfully achieved;\n\u2022\nevaluation and negotiation of a proposed transaction may distract management from focusing our time and resources on our current operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business;\n\u2022\nthe process of evaluating proposed transactions may be time consuming and expensive and may result in the loss of business opportunities;\n\u2022\nperceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in increased difficulties in retaining key employees, particularly senior management;\n\u2022\neven if we negotiate a definitive agreement, successful integration or execution of the strategic alternative will be subject to additional risks;\n\u2022\nthe current market price of our common stock may reflect a market assumption that a transaction will occur, and during the period in which we are considering a transaction, the market price of our common stock could be highly volatile; and\n\u2022\na failure to complete a transaction could result in a negative perception by investors of our company generally and could cause a decline in the market price of our common stock, as well as lead to greater volatility in the market price of our common stock, all of which could adversely affect our ability to access the equity and financial markets, as well as our ability to explore and enter into different strategic alternatives.\nWe may not reduce our operating expenses as much as planned, which could negatively impact our cost-saving initiatives.\nAs part of our recently enacted corporate restructuring, we intend to reduce our research and corporate expenses while we determine whether and how to respond to the CRL, as well as determine the future of the other indications we are pursuing for solithromycin and the development programs for our other drug candidates, and consider potential business development opportunities. We might not be successful in reducing these expenses as much as we plan or to any significant degree, which could prevent us from meeting our strategic objectives and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $437.0 million. We have no product revenues, but do have revenue from contract research and upfront and milestone fees paid in connection with a license agreement. We have funded our operations to date from the private sale of equity and debt, our IPO and public offerings of our common stock. We expect to incur substantial additional losses over at least the next few years as we pursue our research, development, pre-clinical testing, clinical trial and commercialization activities, especially those related to solithromycin, especially to address the CRL, and fusidic acid, and we expect these losses to continue for a period of time until the approval of and any resulting launch of solithromycin, if any. In addition,\nwe also expect to incur additional costs operating as a public company. The amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are uncertain.\nIf we are unable to commercialize solithromycin for the treatment of CABP or experience significant delays in doing so, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to generate product revenues from our main product candidate solithromycin for the treatment of CABP will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of solithromycin for such indication, if approved.\nIn May 2016, we announced the completion of the NDAs for solithromycin for the treatment of CABP. In late December 2016, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, to our NDAs for solithromycin for the treatment of CABP. The FDA issues complete response letters to indicate that the review cycle for an application is complete and that the application is not ready for approval in its present form. The FDA determined that the risk of hepatotoxicity had not been adequately characterized. The FDA noted the size of the safety database is limited to 920 patients who received solithromycin at the proposed dose and duration, and is too small to adequately characterize the nature and frequency of serious hepatic adverse effects. To address this deficiency, the FDA is recommending a comparative study to evaluate the safety of solithromycin in patients with CABP. Specifically, the CRL recommends that we consider a study of approximately 9,000 patients exposed to solithromycin to enable exclusion of serious drug induced liver injury, or DILI, events occurring at a rate of approximately 1:3000 with a 95% probability.\nIn addition, the CRL noted that while the FDA reserves comment on the proposed labeling until the NDAs are otherwise adequate, even in the absence of a case of Hy\u2019s Law or of another form of serious DILI in future studies, labeling will need to include adequate information about the potential for hepatotoxicity, limiting use to patients who have limited therapeutic options and limitations regarding duration of therapy. A comprehensive plan for post-marketing safety assessment including an enhanced pharmacovigilance program will also be required.\nFurther, the CRL stated that during recent inspections of the Wockhardt and Hospira manufacturing facilities, the FDA field investigator conveyed deficiencies to representatives of the facilities. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required prior to approval of the NDAs.\nWhile we have met and expect to continue dialogue with the FDA to discuss the CRL and are working to address the issues raised in the CRL, approval of our NDAs may not be received for a number of reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may not prove the safety of solithromycin if there is a higher rate of DILI events than that set out in the CRL;\n\u2022\nour third party manufacturers may not provide proper manufacturing capabilities that meet regulatory approval; and\n\u2022\nthe FDA could raise other issues not set out in the CRL.\nOur MAA for solithromycin for the treatment of CABP remains under review in the EU. If the MAA is not approved by the EMA, we will not receive marketing authorization for solithromycin in the EU and will be unable to sell solithromycin in the EU.\nIf our current applications for marketing approval in the U.S. and the EU are denied, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials at significant delay and cost or abandon development of solithromycin altogether. The failure to achieve regulatory approval of solithromycin for the treatment of CABP could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval, any required post-marketing safety studies may fail to demonstrate safety, the labeling approved by the FDA may be so onerous as to prevent doctor and patient acceptance of solithromycin or other issues may arise with the administration, marketing or manufacture of solithromycin that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur planned commercialization of solithromycin for the treatment of CABP could be delayed or denied if our third party manufacturers do not meet regulatory requirements.\nEach component of our planned solithromycin products, both the oral and intravenous formulations that are the subjects of our NDAs for the treatment of CABP on file with both the FDA and the EMA, as well as the manufacturer of each component, must meet all applicable regulatory requirements in order to receive regulatory approval as well as maintain regulatory compliance after approval. This occurred in 2016 when the FDA imposed an import restriction on a Wockhardt facility in India that manufactures solithromycin for us and the FDA cited in the CRL that there were deficiencies at the Wockhardt and Hospira facilities regarding their compliance with cGMP.\nIn the future, any of the following could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects:\n\u2022\nIf any manufacturer we employ for the production of solithromycin cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA, in which event we would not receive approval from the FDA for solithromycin for the treatment of CABP;\n\u2022\nEven if our manufacturers are successful in ultimately meeting FDA requirements for our NDAs, compliance issues that arise prior to receipt of approval of the NDAs could cause significant and expensive delays prior to receiving approval;\n\u2022\nA delay in receiving approval of the NDAs could negatively impact any pre-launch activities for solithromycin;\n\u2022\nIf approval is received, the failure of our third party manufacturers to continue to meet applicable regulatory requirements could result in the loss of those manufacturing sources, which could cause shortages of commercial product.\nThese same risks apply to our current application to the EMA for solithromycin for the treatment of CABP.\nWe are heavily dependent on the success of solithromycin and, to a lesser extent, fusidic acid, which are still under clinical development. The FDA and foreign regulatory approval process is lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for solithromycin or fusidic acid our business will be substantially harmed.\nWe have no products that have been approved for sale. We cannot commercialize, market, or sell solithromycin or fusidic acid in the U.S. without FDA approval. FDA approval for either product, if received, is at least one year away. To commercialize solithromycin outside of the U.S., we would need applicable foreign regulatory approval, for which we have submitted an MAA to the EMA. The clinical development of solithromycin and fusidic acid for any indication is susceptible to the risk of failure inherent in any stage of drug development, including failure to achieve efficacy across a broad population of patients, the occurrence of severe adverse events and the FDA or any applicable foreign regulatory authority determining that a drug product is not approvable.\nThe process required to obtain approval for commercialization from the FDA and similar foreign authorities is unpredictable, and typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials depending on numerous factors. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to obtain regulatory approval may change during the course of a product\u2019s clinical development. We may fail to obtain regulatory approval for solithromycin, fusidic acid or any other product candidates for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for any indication;\n\u2022\nthe results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval, and/or the FDA may require additional, expensive trials;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to demonstrate that a product candidate is non-inferior or superior to the current standard of care, future competitive therapies in development, or over placebo in any indications for which the FDA requires a placebo-controlled trial;\n\u2022\nthe data collected from clinical trials of any product candidates that we develop may not be sufficient to support the submission of a new drug application, or NDA, or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the U.S. or elsewhere;\n\u2022\nthe approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from pre-clinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data generated at our clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the clinical practices of the third-party clinical research organizations, or CROs, we use for clinical trials; and\n\u2022\nthe FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we or our collaborators enter into agreements for clinical and commercial supplies.\nThis lengthy approval process as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results may prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval to market solithromycin, fusidic acid or any future product candidates for any indication, which would significantly harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nClinical trials involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nClinical testing is expensive, can take many years to complete and its outcome is highly uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process due to inadequate performance of a drug or inadequate adherence by patients or investigators to clinical trial protocols. Pursuant to FDA guidelines, new drugs must show non-inferiority or superiority to existing approved treatments. We conducted our solithromycin for CABP clinical trials pursuant to proposed guidelines published by the FDA. While we believed we had completed all the clinical trials necessary to support the NDA for solithromycin for CABP and have a sufficient database of both efficacy and safety, the FDA disagreed with our assessment and is requiring additional clinical data to support approval, specifically lack of liver toxicity. This has added to the duration and cost of the development of solithromycin for CABP, and the liver toxicity trial could take longer and be more expensive than we currently estimate. Any additional trials, for whatever reason, would add to the time and cost of solithromycin\u2019s development. We face these same risks with any other indication we are pursuing for solithromycin as well as for our other product candidates.\nIn addition, the results of pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials of product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. For example, the positive results of our Phase 3 trial for fusidic acid for the treatment of ABSSSI that we announced in late February 2017 may not be repeated in subsequent trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience than us, have suffered significant setbacks in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials despite achieving successful results in earlier stage trials. The failure to obtain positive results in any of our Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials could seriously impair the development prospects, and even prevent regulatory approval, of solithromycin or fusidic acid or any candidate in our existing proprietary macrolide library. Even with positive clinical trial results, there is risk that regulators will not accept the clinical trial findings or will require additional trials or other data, as we recently experienced with the CRL for solithromycin as a treatment for CABP.\nFurther, regulatory approvals in foreign countries are subject to risks associated with different regulatory requirements, including clinical trial guidance, and regulatory schemes, including, for example, multiple country regulation within the European Union. As a result, clinical trial results and other regulatory processes undertaken by us within the U.S. may not be accepted in foreign countries, which would add to the cost and time to develop our product candidates in foreign countries.\nWe have no experience as a company in bringing a drug to regulatory approval or to the market.\nAs a company, we have never obtained regulatory approval for, or commercialized, a drug. It is possible that the FDA may refuse to accept any or all of our planned NDAs for substantive review or may conclude after review of our data that our application is insufficient to obtain regulatory approval of solithromycin, fusidic acid or any future product candidates, as it did in issuing the CRL for our NDAs for solithromycin for the treatment of CABP in December 2016. As with the CRL, if the FDA does not accept or approve any or all of our future NDAs, it may require that we conduct additional clinical, pre-clinical or manufacturing validation studies, which may be time-consuming and costly, and submit that data before it will reconsider our applications. Depending on the extent of these or any other FDA required studies, approval of any NDA or application that we submit may be significantly delayed, possibly for several years, or may require us to expend more resources than we have planned or have available. We estimate that we will not be able to complete a response to the CRL until the second half of 2017 at the earliest. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing solithromycin for CABP or any other indication or fusidic acid, generating revenues and achieving and sustaining profitability. It is also possible that additional studies, if performed and completed, may not be considered sufficient by the FDA to approve any NDA we submit, including our current NDAs for solithromycin for CABP. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to abandon our current and any future NDAs for either solithromycin or fusidic acid or both, which would materially adversely affect our business and could potentially cause us to cease operations. We face similar risks for any approval in a foreign jurisdiction.\nWe might not successfully differentiate solithromycin from telithromycin (Ketek\u00ae), a macrolide found to cause severe side effects, including liver failure.\nKetek is a macrolide antibiotic that the FDA approved in 2004 for the treatment of multi-drug resistant pneumococci and other CABP bacteria. Soon after release, however, Ketek was found to cause reversible visual disturbances, exacerbate myasthenia gravis (a neurological disorder characterized by improper muscle regulation) and cause liver failure. These effects led the FDA to require the drug label for Ketek to include a strengthened warning section regarding specific drug-related adverse events and contributed to Ketek being withdrawn in 2007 for the treatment of all infections other than CABP. Through ongoing research, we have developed multiple ways to differentiate solithromycin from Ketek. Our research suggests these side effects may be caused by the pyridine moiety, which forms a part of the structure of Ketek. We have demonstrated that pyridine inhibits the action of nicotinic acid acetylcholine receptors that could result in the side effects caused by Ketek. Solithromycin and older generation macrolides, including azithromycin and clarithromycin, that have been widely marketed do not have a pyridine component.\nBecause of the Ketek experience, we believe solithromycin, which is a macrolide, was carefully scrutinized by the FDA as part of its review of our NDAs for solithromycin as a treatment for CABP. Another ketolide, cethromycin (Restanza) that is being developed by Advanced Life Sciences, received a complete response letter from the FDA in 2009, and it appears that development of the drug has not continued. The FDA attributed its rejection to the company\u2019s trial design, which enrolled patients with less severe CABP and was conducted prior to the release of the FDA\u2019s updated trial design guidance. Also, the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on one of our Phase 1 clinical trials for oral solithromycin over concern about possible toxicity related to solithromycin, and subsequently converted the partial clinical hold into a full clinical hold in April 2010. At the time, the FDA had concerns that solithromycin, as a fluoroketolide, may have similar toxicity issues as Ketek. While we addressed the FDA\u2019s concerns and were allowed to proceed with the trial, which we successfully completed, we believe that the clinical hold indicates the scrutiny that the FDA applied to our NDAs for solithromycin due to the Ketek experience.\nIf our prior research is proven to be incorrect or if in a study of liver toxicity in response to the CRL or in other research solithromycin demonstrates similar side effects to Ketek or poses high risk of liver injury or any other SAE, the FDA might not approve solithromycin. Even if we receive approval and future studies show no adverse events, the CRL stated the FDA will require a warning on the label (as stated in the CRL) and might withdraw approval, require us to conduct additional clinical trials, or require additional warnings on product labeling, which could limit the available market for solithromycin, any of which would significantly harm our ability to generate revenues from solithromycin.\nEven if the FDA approves solithromycin, physicians may not be convinced that solithromycin is a safe and effective treatment for CABP and other infections, especially with a label warning that the CRL stated will be required. If physicians believe solithromycin demonstrates characteristics similar to Ketek or poses other unacceptably high risks, they might not prescribe solithromycin, which would negatively affect our revenues.\nThe results of any ongoing or future study or trial involving solithromycin, if negative, could have an adverse effect on FDA and other regulatory approval of solithromycin as a treatment for CABP as well our commercialization efforts for solithromycin and market acceptance of the same.\nIf the results of any of our ongoing or future studies of solithromycin should be negative, it could have an adverse effect on the planned NDA and potential approval of solithromycin as a treatment for CABP, including a delay in or lack of approval, which was the case with our NDAs for solithromycin for CABP. If after approval were received, negative results in any study or trial of solithromycin could have a negative effect on our commercialization and market acceptance of solithromycin, including downward pressure on pricing.\nOur dependence upon third parties for the manufacture and supply of solithromycin, fusidic acid and any future product candidates may cause delays in, or prevent us from, successfully developing and commercializing our products.\nWe do not currently have nor do we plan to build the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture solithromycin or fusidic acid for use in the conduct of our clinical trials or for commercial supply. We have contracted with companies in India, Japan and North America to provide commercial supplies of solithromycin. Similarly, in July 2013, we contracted with Hospira Worldwide, Inc., or Hospira (now owned by Pfizer), to provide us with clinical and commercial supplies of the intravenous form of solithromycin. Under the terms of the agreement, if Hospira fails to supply a specified percentage of product to us, we may seek an alternate supplier. We aim to have several sources of oral and IV solithromycin in several locations worldwide and to that end we are working on developing at least one additional manufacturing source in North America for IV solithromycin. However, if any of these entities were unable to provide our needed supply of oral or intravenous solithromycin, we may not be able to negotiate an agreement with another source on acceptable terms or in a timely fashion, if at all.\nIn addition, regulatory requirements could pose barriers to the manufacture of our API and finished product for solithromycin and Fusidic acid. Our third-party manufacturers are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, regulations. As a result, the facilities used by any of our current and future manufacturers to manufacture solithromycin and fusidic acid must be approved by the FDA after we submit an NDA to the FDA and before approval of solithromycin and fusidic acid. Similar regulations apply to manufacturers of our products for use or sale in foreign countries. We do not control the manufacturing process of solithromycin or fusidic acid and are completely dependent on these third-party manufacturing partners for compliance with the applicable regulatory requirements for the manufacture of solithromycin and fusidic acid API and their finished product. If our manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA and any applicable foreign regulatory authority, they will not be able to secure the applicable approval for their manufacturing facilities. If these facilities are unable to comply with the FDA\u2019s cGMP requirements, or otherwise are not approved for the commercial manufacture of solithromycin or fusidic acid, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would result in significant delays of up to several years in obtaining approval for solithromycin or fusidic acid. In addition, our manufacturers will be subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies for compliance with cGMPs and similar regulatory requirements. Failure by any of our manufacturers to comply with applicable cGMP regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspensions or withdrawals of approvals, operating restrictions, interruptions in supply, and criminal prosecutions, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nAs part of its review of our NDAs for solithromycin for CABP, the FDA evaluated the CMC section of those NDAs. The FDA placed an import alert on a Wockhardt manufacturing facility in August 2016, several months after our NDAs had been submitted and accepted for review by the FDA. The FDA\u2019s concerns with Wockhardt\u2019s operations and facilities are related to the GMP quality systems at Wockhardt. In the CRL issued by the FDA on our NDAs, the FDA stated that during recent inspections of the Wockhardt and Hospira manufacturing facilities, the FDA field investigator conveyed deficiencies to representatives of the facilities. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required prior to approval of the NDAs. Details on these deficiencies were not provided in the CRL. In December 2016, the FDA issued a warning letter to Wockhardt regarding cGMP compliance deficiencies at their Ankleshwar facility. There can be no assurance if or when Wockhardt will be able to resolve these issues.\nSimilarly, one of two facilities in India at which Wockhardt produced capsules of solithromycin for clinical trials, was audited by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, the regulatory agency of Great Britain, which took issue with Wockhardt\u2019s practices at the plant and as a result the capsules of solithromycin produced at that plant could not be imported into Europe for use in our Phase 3 clinical trial. We had some capsules on hand and also produced new capsules, but the incident caused a several month delay in having drug available for our Phase 3 oral solithromycin trials in Europe, which, however, was planned to be in advance of the onset of flu season in Europe so the delay had minimal impact on the trial timeline. However, similar experiences could occur with more significant impact on our development program or commercialization of solithromycin.\nAs part of our earlier commercialization plans for the anticipated demand for solithromycin for the treatment of CABP, we have been developing various additional supply sources for the API of solithromycin. This includes manufacturing activities at Uquifa in Jiutepec, Mexico, which we began in the second quarter of 2014. We have accelerated our API manufacturing activities with Uquifa and expect to provide data from Uquifa to the FDA to address the issues noted in the CRL related to manufacturing. However, as we experienced, the issues cited by the FDA at the Wockhardt facility adversely affected our NDAs and similar issues, if experienced, could have similar consequences on any future applications.\nWe employ the services of Ercros S.A., or Ercros, to produce fusidic acid\u2019s API and intend to utilize a third-party manufacturer to produce the finished dosing formulation of fusidic acid. We have a long-term exclusive supply arrangement with Ercros to produce the fusidic acid we need in which Ercros agrees to exclusively supply us with fusidic acid in the U.S., and we agree to obtain our supply of fusidic acid for commercial sale exclusively from Ercros, subject to a right to develop a second source for limited supply quantities. We believe Ercros is one of only two currently known manufacturers that can produce fusidic acid compliant with the purity required for human use. The second manufacturer is not available as a supplier to us. Fusidic acid is difficult to produce at the required purity levels because of its complex fermentation process. As such, there are underlying risks associated with its manufacture, which could include cost overruns, new impurities, difficulties in scaling up or reproducing manufacturing processes and lack of timely availability of raw materials. We have yet to identify a viable second source of fusidic acid but continue to research alternatives. If Ercros cannot supply sufficient quantities of fusidic acid to make clinical supplies, it would harm our ability to develop fusidic acid. We may not be able to locate a second manufacturer or, if we do, we may not be able to negotiate an agreement on favorable terms, if at all. On June 20, 2012, the FDA issued a Warning Letter to Ercros, citing cGMP violations at the Ercros facility that manufactures the API for fusidic acid. Although some of the alleged violations may be related to products other than fusidic acid, the FDA\u2019s issuance of a Warning Letter signifies FDA concerns with cGMP compliance at the Ercros facility. We believe Ercros is actively working with FDA to resolve these issues. However, if Ercros is unable to satisfactorily address the FDA\u2019s concerns in a timely manner, the FDA may take further enforcement actions that could significantly jeopardize our supply of fusidic acid API for use in clinical trials or later commercialization. For example, the FDA might issue an import alert, which could preclude us from importing\nfusidic acid API manufactured at the Ercros facility. Particularly in light of the unavailability of alternative suppliers for fusidic acid API, this could significantly impact our ability to develop and commercialize fusidic acid.\nFinally, we also could experience manufacturing delays if our third-party manufacturers give greater priority to the supply of other products over our product candidates or otherwise do not satisfactorily perform according to the terms of the agreement between us. If Hospira, Ercros, or any alternate supplier of API or finished drug product for solithromycin or fusidic acid experiences any significant difficulties in its respective manufacturing processes, does not comply with the terms of the agreement between us or does not devote sufficient time, energy and care to providing our manufacturing needs, we could experience significant interruptions in the supply of solithromycin or fusidic acid, which could impair our ability to supply solithromycin or fusidic acid at the levels required for our clinical trials and commercialization, if approved, and prevent or delay their successful development and commercialization.\nIn addition, our reliance on foreign suppliers poses risks due to possible shipping delays, import restrictions and foreign regulatory regimes. Finally, any manufacturing facility is at risk of natural or man-made disaster, which could significantly reduce our clinical and commercial supplies of drug product.\nThese same risks apply to procuring comparator API or other comparator supplies needed for clinical trials in which we may compare our product candidates to currently approved drugs.\nIf we fail to obtain additional financing, we may not be able to complete the development and commercialization of solithromycin or fusidic acid.\nWe need substantial amounts of cash to complete the clinical development and commercialization of solithromycin and fusidic acid, especially to address the issues raised in the CRL and, if approved by the FDA, the commercial launch of solithromycin for CABP. Prior to the receipt of the CRL, and in conjunction with completing the second of two pivotal clinical trials and the submission of our NDAs for solithromycin for the treatment of CABP during the fourth quarter of 2015, and throughout the majority of 2016 we engaged in certain additional clinical and commercial activities, and accelerated others, including building inventory of solithromycin in preparation for commercial launch in the U.S. (which prior to approval is expensed as research and development expense in accordance with GAAP) and supporting certain investigator-led studies of solithromycin in additional indications. In addition, in 2016 we began to engage in additional sales and marketing preparation activities focused on solithromycin for the treatment of CABP, including hiring additional commercial management personnel, engaging in pricing research and other market research, and began building our specialty antibiotic sales force.\nAs a consequence of the solithromycin complete response letter received, and subsequent discussions with the FDA, resulting in a delay of the potential approval of solithromycin, we recently initiated companywide cost and personnel reductions. These actions have resulted in an approximately 67% reduction in our workforce from 136 to 45 employees, and significant reductions in external spending related to commercial preparedness and non-essential activities. The principal objective of the reductions is to enable us to conserve our financial resources as we evaluate the best path forward with our existing pipeline and potential business development opportunities.\nBased on current assumptions, we believe that our existing cash and equivalents will enable us to fund our current operating expenses and capital requirements for at least the next 12 months from the filing date of this report. Such operating and capital requirements do not contemplate incremental expenses associated with a full scale commercial launch of solithromycin or any additional clinical trials with any of our product candidates. However, we have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Moreover, changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more money than currently expected because of circumstances beyond our control. For example, our clinical trials may encounter technical, enrollment or other issues that could cause our development costs to increase more than we expect and we may be required to conduct additional trials requested by the FDA that could increase our costs significantly. We would also need to raise additional funds sooner if we choose to initiate clinical trials more rapidly than we presently anticipate or if we elect to conduct additional trials for alternate indications. In any event, the costs to develop and launch solithromycin and to develop fusidic acid will be significant and we will need to raise additional capital to execute a safety study for solithroymycin and to support any development for other indications for solithromycin, as well as to continue development activities to obtain regulatory approval of and to commercialize fusidic acid.\nWe may raise additional capital from the issuance of equity and/or debt securities, collaborations with third parties, out-licensing of rights to our product candidates and other means, or a combination of any of the above. Securing additional financing, however, will require a substantial amount of time and attention from our management and may divert a disproportionate amount of their attention away from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our management\u2019s ability to conduct our day-to-day operations. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may be required to:\n\u2022\nsignificantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of solithromycin and/or fusidic acid;\n\u2022\nseek collaborators for solithromycin and/or fusidic acid at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; and\n\u2022\nrelinquish or license, potentially on unfavorable terms, our rights to solithromycin and/or fusidic acid that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we will be prevented from pursuing discovery, development and commercialization efforts, and our ability to generate revenues and achieve or sustain profitability will be substantially harmed.\nThe commercial success of solithromycin, fusidic acid and any other product candidates that we develop, if approved in the future, will depend upon attaining significant market acceptance of these products among physicians and payors.\nAs a company, we have never commercialized a product candidate for any indication. Even if solithromycin, fusidic acid or any other product candidate that we develop is approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities for marketing and sale, physicians may not prescribe our approved products, which would prevent us from generating revenues or becoming profitable. Efforts to educate the medical community and third party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may not be successful. If a product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of market acceptance, we may not generate significant revenues and we may not become profitable. Market acceptance of solithromycin, fusidic acid and any other product candidates that we develop by physicians, patients and payors will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which the product is approved;\n\u2022\nacceptance by physicians and payors of each product as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022\nlimitations or warnings contained in a product\u2019s FDA-approved labeling, as will be the case if solithromycin is approved for CABP;\n\u2022\nprevalence and severity of adverse side effects;\n\u2022\nthe cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments, including numerous generic drug products, such as azithromycin, levofloxacin and vancomycin;\n\u2022\nthe relative convenience and ease of administration of solithromycin in the treatment of CABP and fusidic acid in the treatment of ABSSSI and/or refractory bone and joint infections;\n\u2022\nthe availability and efficacy of competitive drugs;\n\u2022\nour ability to recruit and retain a sales force, if necessary;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our or any third-party partner\u2019s sales force and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nour ability to forecast demand and maintain sufficient supplies of our drug products;\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture or obtain commercial quantities of our drug products;\n\u2022\nthe strength of our sales and marketing and distribution support;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our marketing and advertising campaigns;\n\u2022\nour ability to deliver our products on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which bacteria develop resistance to any antibiotic product candidate that we develop, thereby limiting its efficacy in treating or managing infections;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain pricing sufficient to realize a meaningful return on our investment;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which the product is approved for inclusion on formularies of hospitals and managed care organizations;\n\u2022\nwhether the product is designated under physician treatment guidelines as a first-line therapy or as a second- or third-line therapy for particular infections;\n\u2022\nthe availability of adequate reimbursement by third parties, such as insurance companies and other health care payors, and/or by government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity about a product or favorable publicity about competitive products; and\n\u2022\npotential product liability claims.\nEven if the medical community accepts that solithromycin and fusidic acid are safe and efficacious for their approved indications, physicians may not immediately be receptive to the use or may be slow to adopt solithromycin as an accepted treatment for CABP and fusidic acid as an accepted treatment for ABSSSI and/or bone and joint infections. While we believe each of solithromycin and fusidic acid has significant advantages, we cannot assure you that any labeling approved by the FDA will permit us to promote solithromycin or fusidic acid as being safe or superior to competing products. If either or both of solithromycin or fusidic acid are approved but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians and payors, we may not generate sufficient or any revenues from these products and we may not become profitable. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of solithromycin and fusidic acid may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nThe successful commercialization of our product candidates will depend on the pricing we are able to achieve for our product candidates, both inside and outside the U.S.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates will be dependent on whether we can obtain adequate pricing for any particular product candidate. Pricing may be substantially dependent on our ability to obtain reimbursement from third party payors, both in the U.S. and in foreign countries. Outside the U.S., certain countries, including a number of European Union members, set prices and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products, or medicinal products as they are commonly referred to in the E.U., with limited participation from those marketing the products. We cannot be sure that any prices and reimbursement will be acceptable to us or our strategic commercial partners. If the regulatory authorities in these foreign jurisdictions set prices or reimbursement that are not commercially attractive for us or our strategic commercial partners, our revenues from sales by us or our collaborators, and the potential profitability of our product candidates, in those countries would be negatively affected. Further, through contractual or other arrangements, the price we may be able to obtain in foreign countries may be dependent on the price we can achieve in the U.S.\nOur estimates of the market for and commercialization of solithromycin as a treatment for CABP or for any other product candidate may be inaccurate or vary significantly over the potential market size.\nThe potential market opportunities for solithromycin and any other product candidate are difficult to estimate precisely. Our estimates of the potential market opportunities are predicated on many assumptions, including industry knowledge and publications, third party research reports and other surveys. While we believe that our internal assumptions are reasonable, these assumptions involve the exercise of significant judgment on the part of our management, are inherently uncertain and the reasonableness of these assumptions has not been assessed by an independent source. If any of the assumptions proves to be inaccurate, the actual markets for our product candidates could be smaller than our estimates of the potential market opportunities.\nIn addition, our estimates regarding the timing and amount of acceptance of any product candidate, and the pricing achievable for any product candidate may prove incorrect. Further, our plans for commercialization of any product candidate may not materialize in the time or manner we anticipate and may be adversely impacted by any required label warnings, as will be the case if solithromycin is approved for CABP, or any perceived safety or efficacy concerns. Finally, we may underestimate the demand for a product candidate, which could lead to lack of commercial quantities when needed and result in market backlash against the product candidate. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our plans for commercialization of and the generation of any revenue from any product candidate.\nIf we believe regulatory approval and a sufficient market are likely for solithromycin for CABP, we would expect to build our own marketing and sales organization for solithromycin for CABP, but have no experience as a company in marketing drug products. If we are unable to successfully establish our own marketing and sales capabilities, or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our products after they are approved, we may not be able to generate product revenues.\nIf we believe regulatory approval of and a sufficient market for solithromycin for CABP are likely, we would expect to build our U.S. sales organization for the marketing, sales and distribution of solithromycin as a treatment for CABP, the size and nature of which would be determined by approved labeling and the potential market for solithromycin in light of that label. The establishment and development of our own sales force will be expensive and time consuming and could delay the planned launch of solithromycin, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully develop this capability. The timing of building any sales force will be dependent on many factors, including the anticipated approval date and our financial resources. We may seek one or more licensing partners to handle some or all of the sales and marketing of solithromycin for CABP in the U.S. In order to successfully\ncommercialize any other products, we must develop these capabilities on our own or make arrangements with third parties for the marketing, sales and distribution of our products. There also may be certain markets within the U.S. for solithromycin for which we may seek a co-promotion arrangement. If we are not successful in building our own sales force, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with third parties to sell solithromycin or fusidic acid on favorable terms or at all. We would not have control over a third-party sales organization and would be dependent on that organization for successfully selling any of our products. Such a third-party organization may not devote the necessary manpower, time, resources or priority to our products, which would negatively impact our results of operations. In the event we are unable to develop our own marketing and sales force or collaborate with a third-party marketing and sales organization, we would not be able to commercialize solithromycin, fusidic acid or any other product candidates that we develop, which would negatively impact our ability to generate product revenues. Further, whether we commercialize products on our own or rely on a third party to do so, our ability to generate revenue will be dependent on the effectiveness of the sales force. In addition, to the extent we rely on third parties to commercialize our approved products, we will likely receive less revenues than if we commercialized these products ourselves.\nA failure to maintain optimal inventory levels to meet commercial demand for any product that may be approved, including solithromycin, could harm our reputation and subject us to financial losses.\nBecause accurate product planning is necessary to ensure that we maintain optimal inventory levels for any product candidate that might be approved, including solithromycin, significant differences between our estimates and judgments and future actual demand for any approved products and the shelf life of inventory may result in significant charges for excess inventory or purchase commitments in the future. If we are required to recognize charges for excess inventories, such charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to maintain optimal inventory levels also depends on the performance of third-party contract manufacturers. If our manufacturers are unsuccessful in either obtaining raw materials, if we are unable to release inventory on a timely and consistent basis, if we fail to maintain an adequate level of product inventory, if inventory is destroyed or damaged, or if our inventory reaches its expiration date, patients might not have access to our products, sales could be lost, our reputation and brands could be harmed, and physicians may be less likely to prescribe our products in the future, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are obligated to provide Toyama with clinical and commercial supply of solithromycin at prices determined by our manufacturing costs, which could negatively impact our results of operations in the event we cannot provide those supplies on our own and have to purchase them outside of our contracted suppliers. To provide this supply, we entered into a supply agreement with Fujifilm, which contains a minimum purchase requirement, which if triggered, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nPursuant to the terms of our supply agreement with Toyama, we are the exclusive supplier (with certain limitations) to Toyama and its sublicensees of API for solithromycin for use in licensed products in Japan, as well as the exclusive supplier to Toyama and its sublicensees of finished forms of solithromycin to be used in clinical trials in Japan. Pursuant to the supply agreement, Toyama will pay us for such clinical supply of finished product and all supplies of API for solithromycin for any purpose, other than the manufacture of products for commercial sale in Japan, at prices equal to our costs. All API for solithromycin supplied by us to Toyama for use in the manufacture of finished product for commercial sale in Japan will be ordered from us at prices determined by our manufacturing costs, and which may, depending on such costs, equal, exceed, or be less than such costs. The supply agreement will continue until the expiration or termination of the license agreement. In the event we cannot provide Toyama\u2019s supplies under our own contracts with manufactures, we would have to either reduce our own supply of solithromycin or purchase it outside of our contracted manufacturers, which would negatively impact our results of operations. In January 2016, we entered into an API supply agreement with Fujifilm to provide a supply source in Japan to meet our obligations under the supply agreement with Toyama, but circumstances could occur that might render this source insufficient for our purposes. In the event that supply validation studies are completed and Fujifilm has constructed a facility to provide us the supply, we are subject to a minimum purchase requirement for a period of time that could run to an aggregated approximately $80 million, although such expense would be offset by sales to Toyama, if any.\nFuture legislation, and/or regulations and policies adopted by the FDA or other regulatory health authorities may increase the time and cost required for us to conduct and complete clinical trials for solithromycin, fusidic acid or other product candidates that we develop.\nThe FDA has established regulations, guidelines and policies to govern the drug development and approval process, as have foreign regulatory authorities. Any change in regulatory requirements due to the adoption by the FDA and/or foreign regulatory authorities of new legislation, regulations, or policies may require us to amend existing clinical trial protocols or add new clinical trials to comply with these changes. Such amendments to existing protocols and/or clinical trial applications or the need for new ones, may significantly impact the cost, timing and completion of the clinical trials.\nIn particular, drugs being tested and/or developed for the treatment of CABP, including solithromycin, are subject to proposed guidelines published by the FDA in 2009 (with new guidelines proposed in November 2011 and again in 2014). We have conducted our clinical trials to date according to the standards established by the 2009 and 2011 proposed guidelines. While we expected the FDA to revise the proposed guidelines for CABP, we could not delay development of solithromycin and began the Phase 3 oral trial in December 2012 and the Phase 3 IV-to-oral trial in December 2013, which was before the FDA issued revised proposed guidelines in 2014. While the 2014 proposed guidelines did not impose any new requirements on our Phase 3 trials, the FDA could further revise the guidelines. Any new proposed guidelines may require us to conduct additional clinical trials, re-run previously completed trials to gather data at different endpoints or according to different protocols, or otherwise materially alter our planned clinical development of solithromycin. Any such regulatory change may materially increase our costs, delay the completion of our clinical trials, and otherwise impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidate. Furthermore, the FDA\u2019s guidance documents are not binding on the FDA. As a result, the FDA may not accept the results of clinical trials we conduct even if they were to follow the FDA\u2019s most recent guidance.\nIn addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process, particularly in our areas of focus, may significantly delay or prevent regulatory approval, as well as impose more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nBacteria might develop resistance to solithromycin or fusidic acid, which would decrease the efficacy and commercial viability of that product.\nDrug resistance is primarily caused by the genetic mutation of bacteria resulting from sub-optimal exposure to antibiotics where the drug does not kill all of the bacteria. While antibiotics have been developed to treat many of the most common infections, the extent and duration of their use worldwide has resulted in new mutated strains of bacteria resistant to current treatments. We are developing solithromycin and fusidic acid to treat patients infected with drug-resistant bacteria. With respect to solithromycin, which is a next generation macrolide, resistance issues associated with earlier generations of macrolides have led to a decrease in their use for treating serious respiratory tract infections such as CABP. If physicians, rightly or wrongly, associate the resistance issues of earlier generation macrolides with solithromycin, physicians might not prescribe solithromycin for treating a broad range of infections. Similarly, resistance to fusidic acid has developed outside the U.S. Our in vitro studies have shown that the reason for resistance to the oral formulation is that it was not dosed optimally. We believe that overuse of topical formulations of fusidic acid also contributed to development of resistance outside the U.S. If fusidic acid is improperly dosed, or if our studies incorrectly attributed an increase in resistance to inappropriate dosing, bacteria might develop resistance to fusidic acid in the U.S. If these bacteria develop resistance to solithromycin or fusidic acid, the efficacy of these products would decline, which would negatively affect our potential to generate revenues from these products.\nDelays in clinical trials are common and have many causes, and any such delays could result in increased costs to us and jeopardize or delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval and commence product sales as currently contemplated.\nWe may experience delays in clinical trials of our product candidates. Our planned clinical trials might not begin on time, may be interrupted or delayed once commenced, might need to be redesigned, might not enroll a sufficient number of patients or might not be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial;\n\u2022\nimposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining required institutional review board, or IRB, approval at each site;\n\u2022\ndelays in identifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators;\n\u2022\ndelays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial;\n\u2022\ndelays in having patients complete participation in a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\nclinical sites dropping out of a trial to the detriment of enrollment;\n\u2022\ntime required to add new sites;\n\u2022\ndelays in obtaining sufficient supplies of clinical trial materials, including suitable active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, whether of our product candidates or comparator drugs; or\n\u2022\ndelays resulting from negative or equivocal findings of the data safety monitoring board, or DSMB, for a trial.\nWe were subject to such a delay in 2008 when the FDA placed a partial clinical hold on our Phase 2 clinical trial for oral solithromycin over concern about possible toxicity related to solithromycin. The FDA converted the partial clinical hold into a full clinical hold in April 2010. At the time, the FDA had concerns that solithromycin, as a fluoroketolide, may have similar toxicity issues as Ketek. While we addressed the FDA\u2019s concerns and were allowed to proceed with the trial, which we successfully completed, the trial was delayed by approximately 12 months. We could experience one or more such delays with other trials.\nPatient enrollment, a significant factor in the timing of clinical trials, is affected by many factors, including the size and nature of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the design of the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating. In addition, the timing of our clinical trials may be dependent on a specific disease seasonality, as, for example, were our trials for solithromycin, which were dependent on the onset, degree and timing of the CABP season, which tends to occur in the winter months in each hemisphere. We could encounter delays in our ongoing and future clinical trials of solithromycin (for indications other than CABP), fusidic acid or any other product if participating physician investigators encounter unresolved ethical issues associated with enrolling patients in clinical trials of solithromycin (for indications others than CABP), fusidic acid or any other product in lieu of prescribing approved antibiotics that have established safety and efficacy profiles. Any of these delays in completing our clinical trials could increase our costs, slow down our product development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues.\nWe may be required to suspend or discontinue clinical trials due to adverse side effects or other safety risks that could preclude approval of solithromycin or fusidic acid or any of our future product candidates.\nOur clinical trials may be suspended or terminated at any time for a number of reasons. A clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, our collaborators, the FDA or other regulatory authorities due to a failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, presentation of unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using the investigational drug, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions, lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial, or negative or equivocal findings of the DSMB or the IRB for a clinical trial. An IRB may also suspend or terminate our clinical trials for failure to protect patient safety or patient rights. We may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to participants. In addition, regulatory agencies may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials at any time if they believe the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or present an unacceptable safety risk to participants. If we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate any clinical trial of any product candidates that we are developing, the commercial prospects of such product candidates will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues, if at all, from any of these product candidates will be delayed or eliminated. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects significantly.\nWe recently completed a Phase 3 clinical trial of fusidic acid for the treatment of ABSSSI, and we have an ongoing exploratory study for bone and joint infections, but there is no guarantee that the results of our Phase 3 trial for ABSSSI or any other completed trial will demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA or that the results from the ongoing exploratory study for bone and joint infections or any other ongoing or future study will be consistent with the results of prior studies, including the Phase 3 trial for ABSSSI.\nWhile we have completed Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials comparing fusidic acid to linezolid for the treatment of ABSSSI the results of our completed Phase 2 and Phase 3 trial for the treatment of ABSSSI were not powered to show statistical superiority. Comparisons to results from other reported clinical trials, including our completed Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of ABSSSI, can assist in evaluating the potential efficacy of fusidic acid for the treatment of ABSSSI and refractory bone and joint infections; however, there are many factors that affect the outcome for patients in clinical trials, some of which are not apparent in published reports, and results from different trials often cannot be reliably compared. Therefore, there is no assurance that the results of any other trials we conduct for fusidic acid in the treatment of ABSSSI or refractory bone and joint infections will demonstrate safety or efficacy comparable to the results of trials conducted to date or will be sufficient to attain FDA approval.\nIn December 2012, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of fusidic acid for the treatment of prosthetic joint infections. In October 2013, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to fusidic acid for the treatment of PJI and we will work to have orphan drug designation granted for fusidic acid for refractory bone and joint infections. There is no published FDA guidance for clinical trials for PJI or for bone and joint infections. Further, we need to determine the impact of the orphan drug designation for PJI and possible designation for bone and joint infections on our clinical development plan and the Phase 2 clinical trial data to support an NDA. In the Phase 2 PJI trial we noted that although oral fusidic acid plus rifampin had similar efficacy to intravenous vancomycin, rifampin significantly diminished the blood levels of fusidic acid. We concluded the Phase 2 trial prior to completion because we demonstrated that fusidic acid in combination with rifampin was generally comparable to intravenous standard of care antibiotics. We believe that the proper dosing of fusidic acid is without rifampin and that the loading dose and maintenance dose that we had tested in the ABSSSI\nPhase 2 trial was optimal for a Phase 3 refractory bone and joint infection trial. We have met with the FDA to discuss the development plan for fusidic acid for ABSSSI and bone and joint infections. Based on that meeting, our plan involves testing fusidic acid for long-term suppressive therapy of refractory bone and joint infections, including PJI. Also based on our discussions with the FDA, in November 2015, we began a Phase 3 trial for the treatment of ABSSSI, for which we reported topline results in February 2017, and began a refractory bone and joint infection study in January2016 to determine fusidic acid\u2019s safety and efficacy. With the ABSSSI study now completed, we plan to meet with the FDA to discuss the next steps required to bring fusidic acid to patients in the United States. However, the FDA is not bound by discussions and if the FDA subsequently believes that the plan as discussed and developed is inadequate, it could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize fusidic acid for the treatment of ABSSSI and/or refractory bone and joint infections.\nFusidic acid is not well absorbed in animals, which could impair our ability to obtain FDA approval.\nAs required by FDA regulations, we conducted pre-clinical studies of fusidic acid to determine its level of absorption in animals. The studies indicated that fusidic acid is not very well absorbed and has a short half-life in animals, resulting in minimum exposure levels which limited the ability to test fusidic acid in animal models. Fusidic acid, the API in fusidic acid, has been used for several decades in humans outside the U.S. and we believe there is sufficient human clinical trial data for fusidic acid to overcome the lack of absorption in animal studies. Despite this human data, and while all of our pre-clinical tests were benign and indicated no safety or tolerability issues, our limited ability to test fusidic acid in animal models may adversely affect our ability to obtain FDA approval.\nEven if the FDA approves solithromycin for the treatment of CABP and fusidic acid for the treatment of ABSSSI and bone and joint infections, adverse effects discovered after approval could adversely affect the market for those products.\nIf we obtain regulatory approval for solithromycin, fusidic acid or any other product candidate that we develop, and we or others later discover that our products cause adverse effects, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change the way the product is administered, conduct additional clinical studies, implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, or restrict the distribution of the product;\n\u2022\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients and our liability insurance may not adequately cover those claims; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of, or prevent altogether, the commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe continue to have negative cash flows from operations since inception and might not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our existing indebtedness to Comerica Bank, the level of which indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOn July 10, 2015, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Comerica Bank, or Comerica, pursuant to which we could and did borrow $20.0 million in a term loan and, if the FDA approves our planned NDA, for solithromycin, we may also borrow, under a revolver, an aggregate amount equal to the lesser of (i) up to 75% of our eligible inventory and 80% of eligible accounts receivable or (ii) $10.0 million. If the FDA approves our planned NDA for solithromycin, we may convert the term loan to the revolver, in which event the revolver would have a maximum amount available to us of $25.0 million. Amounts borrowed under the term loan may be repaid and reborrowed at any time without penalty or premium. The term loan is interest-only through April 30, 2016, followed by an amortization period of 36 months of equal monthly payments of principal plus interest, beginning on May 1, 2016 and continuing on the same day of each month thereafter until paid in full. Amounts available to be borrowed under the revolver may also be repaid and reborrowed at any time without penalty or premium prior to December 31, 2017, at which time all advances under the revolver shall be immediately due and payable in full. Our ability to make payments on this indebtedness depends on our ability to generate cash in the future. We expect to experience negative cash flow for the foreseeable future as we fund our operations and capital expenditures. There can be no assurance that we will be in a position to repay this indebtedness when due or obtain extensions of the maturity date. We anticipate that we will need to secure additional funding in order for us to be able to satisfy our obligations when due. We cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If that additional funding involves the sale of equity securities or convertible securities, it would result in the issuance of additional shares of our capital stock, which would result in dilution to our stockholders.\nMoreover, this level of debt could have important consequences to you as an investor in our securities. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to payments owed to our licensors;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for the development, clinical testing, approval and marketing of our products;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our competitors that are less leveraged than we are;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to both general and industry-specific adverse economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional funds.\nIn addition, the loan is secured by substantially all of our personal property assets except our intellectual property and our stock in our subsidiaries. In the event we fail to make timely payments or breach any of our representations or other obligations in the agreement, or upon any circumstance or occurrence that has a material adverse effect on the loan collateral, our business operations, properties, assets, prospects or condition, or our ability to perform our obligations under the loan agreement, Comerica Bank can declare the loan in default. Upon an event of default, the loan principal and accrued interest would become immediately due and payable and Comerica Bank would be entitled to enforce its security interest in our assets.\nThe addition of further debt to our current debt levels could make it more difficult for us to repay our indebtedness and meet our other obligations and would intensify the leverage-related risks that we now face.\nA substantial portion of our future revenues may be dependent upon our strategic partnerships.\nOur success will depend in significant part on our ability to attract and maintain strategic partners and strategic relationships to support the development and commercialization of our product candidates. We currently expect that a substantial portion of our future revenues may be dependent upon our strategic partnership with Toyama and our ability to enter into strategic relationships in other territories. Under the license agreement we entered into in May 2013 with Toyama, Toyama has significant development and commercialization responsibilities with respect to solithromycin in Japan. If Toyama or any of our other strategic partners were to terminate their agreements with us, fail to meet their obligations or otherwise decrease their level of efforts, allocation of resources or other commitments under these agreements with us, our future revenues could be negatively impacted and the development and commercialization of product candidates could be negatively impacted and/or interrupted. In addition, if some or any of the development, regulatory and commercial milestones are not achieved or if certain net sales thresholds are not achieved, as set forth in the Toyama agreement or any agreements with other strategic partners, we will not fully realize the expected economic benefits of those agreements. Further, the achievement of certain of the milestones under our partnership agreements will depend on factors that are outside of our control and most are not expected to be achieved for several years, if at all. Any failure to successfully maintain our strategic partnership agreements could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues.\nStrategic partners may cease to pursue their own development of our product candidates or cease funding and other activities required by our agreements with those strategic partners for reasons beyond our control.\nIn May 2013, we entered into a license agreement with Toyama under which Toyama is to initiate certain clinical trials, obtain regulatory approval and launch and commercialize approved licensed products in Japan. If the results of Toyama\u2019s studies are disappointing or inconclusive, if Toyama were to breach its obligations under the license agreement, or if Toyama decides to cease developing solithromycin for any reason, the development of solithromycin in Japan could be materially harmed, and any negative clinical results could materially harm our own development efforts for solithromycin. In addition, the loss of milestone payments from Toyama called for under the license agreement could have a material adverse impact on our capital resources and ability to conduct our operations. These same risks will apply to any other strategic partnership into which we may enter in the future.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may be delayed in obtaining, or may ultimately not be able to obtain, regulatory approval for or commercialize solithromycin, fusidic acid or any other product candidates.\nWe have relied, and plan to continue to rely, on various CROs to recruit patients, monitor and manage data for our on-going clinical programs for solithromycin and fusidic acid, as well as for the execution of our pre-clinical and non-clinical studies. We control only certain aspects of our CROs\u2019 activities; nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our CROs are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s current good clinical practices, or cGCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA for all of our products in clinical development. The FDA enforces these cGCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with applicable cGCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable, and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before deciding whether to approve our product candidates. We cannot assure you that, upon\ninspection, the FDA will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with cGCPs. In addition, to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of solithromycin and fusidic acid to a statistically significant degree our clinical trials will require an adequately large number of test subjects. Any clinical trial that a CRO conducts abroad on our behalf is subject to similar regulation. Accordingly, if our CROs fail to comply with these regulations or recruit a sufficient number of patients, we may have to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nIn addition, our CROs are not our employees and we cannot control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our on-going clinical, non-clinical and pre-clinical programs. Our CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical studies or other drug development activities, which could impede their ability to devote appropriate time to our clinical programs. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements, or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize solithromycin, fusidic acid or any other product candidates that we seek to develop. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for solithromycin, fusidic acid or any other product candidates that we seek to develop would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed or ended.\nWe typically engage one or more CROs on a project-by-project basis for each study or trial. While we have developed and plan to maintain our relationships with CROs that we have previously engaged, we also expect to enter into agreements with other CROs to obtain additional resources and expertise in an attempt to accelerate our progress with regard to on-going clinical, non-clinical and pre-clinical programs and, specifically, the compilation of clinical trial data for submission with an NDA for each of solithromycin and fusidic acid. Switching or entering into new relationships with CROs involves substantial cost and requires extensive management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Although we try to carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nThe timing of the milestone, support and royalty payments we are required to make to Optimer Pharmaceuticals, Inc., The Scripps Research Institute and Macrolide Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is uncertain and could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nIn March 2006, we entered into a Collaborative Research and Development and License Agreement with Optimer Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Optimer (now owned by Merck), pursuant to which we acquired an exclusive license to certain patent applications and other intellectual property related to a series of compounds, including solithromycin, to develop and commercialize licensed products outside of the Association of South East Asian Nations, or ASEAN, countries (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar (Burma), the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam). We have an obligation to make additional payments upon achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercialization milestones. The aggregate amount of such milestone payments we may need to pay is based in part on the number of products developed under the agreement. The aggregate amount (including our two milestone payments to date) would be $27.5 million if four products are developed and gain FDA approval. Additional limited milestone payments would be due if we develop more than four products. We will also pay tiered mid-single-digit royalties based on the amount of annual net sales of solithromycin (or related licensed compounds), if and when approved by regulatory authorities. We have already paid a $0.5 million milestone in 2010 and a $1.0 million milestone in 2012. Optimer can elect to receive certain milestone payments in cash or in shares of our common stock having an equivalent fair market value. The timing of our achievement of these events and corresponding milestone payments to Optimer is subject to factors relating to the clinical and regulatory development and commercialization of solithromycin (or related licensed compounds), many of which are beyond our control. We may become obligated to make a milestone payment when we do not have the cash on hand to make such payment, which could require us to delay our clinical trials, curtail our operations, scale back our commercialization and marketing efforts or seek funds to meet these obligations on terms unfavorable to us. If we were unable to make a milestone payment, we would be in material breach of the agreement, in which event Optimer could terminate the agreement, which would result in the loss of our rights to develop and commercialize solithromycin, which would seriously harm our ability to generate revenues or achieve profitability.\nWe also must pay The Scripps Research Institute various milestone and annual payments, which, while significantly lower than amounts potentially due to Optimer, could become due when we do not have the cash on hand to make such payment, which could require us to delay our clinical trials, curtail our operations, scale back our commercialization and marketing efforts or seek funds to meet these obligations on terms unfavorable to us.\nIn January 2016, we entered into an Option and License Agreement with Macrolide Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or MP, pursuant to which MP granted us an exclusive option to license certain of MP\u2019s patents and know-how involving macrolides, including\nspecifically novel methods of synthesizing solithromycin (the \u201cCompound\u201d). Under the agreement, we will support research at MP focused on developing a novel, cost-competitive manufacturing approach to solithromycin. Under the evaluation program called for in the agreement, MP will conduct research activities for the manufacture of the Compound, which activities we will evaluate to determine whether to exercise the option to license. For conducting the evaluation program, we will pay MP the expected reasonable, documented, direct compensation-related costs of employees and advisors necessary to conduct MP\u2019s portion of the evaluation program in the aggregate amount of $1.5 million, which we will pay in 18 equal consecutive non-refundable, non-creditable monthly installments of $83,333, beginning with the first monthly anniversary of entry into the agreement. Further, we will pay MP up to an aggregate of $1.0 million upon the satisfaction of certain performance milestones. The timing of the milestone payments to MP are subject to factors relating to the Compound, which are beyond our control. Further, the monthly support payments or a milestone payment, if triggered, could be due when we do not have the cash on hand to make such payment, which could require us to seek funds to meet these obligations on terms unfavorable to us. If we were unable to make a support or milestone payment, we would be in material breach of the agreement, in which event MP could terminate the agreement, which would result in the loss of our rights to the synthetic version of solithromycin, which could harm our ability to reduce production costs and develop an alternate supply of solithromycin, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations\nOur loan agreement with Comerica Bank contains covenants that impose restrictions on our operations that may adversely impact the operation of our business.\nOur loan agreement with Comerica Bank contains customary restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, transfer or place a lien or security interest on our assets, merge with or acquire other companies, redeem any shares of our capital stock or pay cash dividends to our stockholders. These restrictions may inhibit our ability to conduct our business and to provide distributions to our stockholders. Future debt securities or other financing arrangements could contain similar or more restrictive negative covenants than the Comerica Bank loan.\nIf approved, solithromycin and fusidic acid will face significant competition from branded and generic antibiotics and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. If solithromycin or fusidic acid is approved, we will have competitors both in the U.S. and internationally, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies. Many of these companies have greater financial and other resources, such as larger research and development staffs and more experienced marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, these companies may obtain regulatory approval more rapidly and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products. They also may invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in-license novel compounds that could make solithromycin, fusidic acid or any other product candidates that we develop obsolete. As a result, our competitors may succeed in commercializing antibiotics before we do. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.\nIf approved, both solithromycin and fusidic acid will face competition from currently commercially available antibiotics, as well as any competing products that may be developed in the future. In July 2012, the United States Congress passed, and President Obama signed, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, which included the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act, or the GAIN Act. The GAIN Act is intended to provide incentives for the development of new, qualified infectious disease products. These incentives might result in more competition in the market for new antibiotics and might cause pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with more resources than we have to shift their efforts towards the development of products that could be competitive with our product candidates. Existing approved products that will compete with solithromycin include azithromycin (sold under the brand name Zithromax \u00ae by Pfizer Inc. and available as a generic), clarithromycin (sold under the brand name Biaxin \u00ae by Abbott Laboratories and available as a generic), moxifloxacin (sold under the brand name Avelox \u00ae by Bayer AG), levofloxacin (sold under the brand name Levaquin by Johnson & Johnson and available as a generic), linezolid (sold under the brand name Zyvox by Pfizer Inc.), ceftriaxone (sold under the brand name Rocephin \u00ae by F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd and available as a generic) and ceftaroline (sold under the brand name Teflaro \u00ae by Forest Laboratories, Inc.). There are two drugs in development to treat CABP: omadacycline, being developed by Paratek Pharmaceuticals, and lefamulin, being developed by Nabriva Therapeutics. Existing approved products that will compete with fusidic acid include vancomycin (available as a generic), linezolid (sold under the brand name Zyvox by Pfizer Inc.), daptomycin (sold under the brand name Cubicin by Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which was acquired by Merck), quinupristin/dalfopristin (sold under the brand name Synercid \u00ae by Sanofi-Aventis and Monarch Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), tigecycline (sold under the brand name Tygacil\u00ae by Pfizer Inc.), telavancin (sold under the brand name Vibativ \u00ae by Theravance, Inc. and Astellas Pharma, Inc.) and ceftaroline (sold under the brand name Teflaro by Forest Laboratories, Inc., now Allergan). Several antibiotics have been approved by the FDA in the past several years. Dalbavancin (Dalvance) and ceftazidime-avibactam (Avycaz) for Allergan, ceftolozane-tazobactam (Zerbaxa) and tedizolid (Sivextro) for Merck, and oritavancin (Orbactiv) for The Medicines Company. None of these approvals are for CABP. Omadacycline (Paratek Pharmaceuticals) and lefamulin (Nabriva Therapeutics), and dalafloxcacin (Melinta) all are expected to be pursued as a possible treatment for ABSSSI and other indications. Ceftobiprole has\nbeen approved in Canada and is being developed in the U.S. for MRSA. Generic antibiotics are typically sold at lower prices than branded antibiotics and are generally preferred by managed care providers of health services.\nIf we are unable to demonstrate the advantages of solithromycin or fusidic acid over competing drugs and drug candidates, we will not be able to successfully commercialize solithromycin or fusidic acid and our results of operations will suffer.\nReimbursement may not be available for solithromycin, fusidic acid or any other product candidates that we develop, which could make it difficult for us to sell our products profitably.\nMarket acceptance and sales of solithromycin, fusidic acid or any other product candidates that we develop will depend on reimbursement policies and may be affected by health care reform measures. Government authorities and third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for solithromycin, fusidic acid or any other product candidates that we develop. Also, we cannot be sure that the amount of reimbursement available, if any, will not reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize solithromycin, fusidic acid or any other product candidates that we develop.\nSpecifically, in both the U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. In the U.S., the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, also called the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for physician-administered drugs. In addition, this legislation provided authority for limiting the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policies and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively, PPACA, became law in the U.S. The goal of PPACA is to reduce the cost of health care and substantially change the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers. While we cannot predict what ultimate impact on federal reimbursement policies this legislation will have in general or on our business specifically, the PPACA may result in downward pressure on pharmaceutical reimbursement, which could negatively affect market acceptance of solithromycin or fusidic acid or any future products. Members of the U.S. Congress and some state legislatures had sought to overturn at least portions of the legislation including those on the mandatory purchase of insurance. However, on June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of these provisions. Members of the U.S. Congress have since proposed a number of legislative initiatives, including repeal of all or portions of the PPACA. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of current proposals or whether new proposals will be made or adopted, when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us if they are adopted.\nThe availability of numerous generic antibiotics at lower prices than branded antibiotics, such as solithromycin or fusidic acid if either were approved for commercial introduction, may also substantially reduce the likelihood of reimbursement for such products. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of solithromycin, fusidic acid and any other products that we develop, due to the trend toward managed health care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative proposals. If we fail to successfully secure and maintain reimbursement coverage for our products or are significantly delayed in doing so, we will have difficulty achieving market acceptance of our products and our business will be harmed.\nIf we are not successful in retaining or attracting as necessary highly qualified personnel, we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceuticals industries depends in large part on our ability to retain or attract as necessary highly qualified managerial, scientific, medical and sales and marketing personnel. This will be especially true in light of the significant reduction in our workforce that we undertook in late February 2017; the retention of the remaining employees may be difficult. While we have provided all of these remaining employees with retention bonuses, there can be no assurance that any of these employees will remain in our employment. Historically, in order to induce valuable employees to remain with us, we have provided stock options that vest over time. The retention bonuses we recently granted consist of stock options and restricted stock units. The value to employees of stock options and restricted stock units will be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that we cannot control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies.\nOur executive and scientific team has expertise in many different aspects of drug discovery and development and in selling and marketing antibiotics in both the inpatient and outpatient markets. We conduct our operations at our facility in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, which is part of the Research Triangle consisting of Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill. This region is headquarters to other biopharmaceutical companies and many academic and research institutions and, as a result, at any given time there may be a shortage of experienced scientists and medical and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for skilled personnel in our area and elsewhere in the U.S. is very intense and competition for experienced scientists may limit our ability to hire and retain highly qualified personnel on acceptable terms or at all.\nDespite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific and medical teams may terminate their employment with us on short notice. We had a change in senior management in December 2016 and do not have a permanent Chief Executive Officer. We have only a short-term at-will employment agreement with our Acting Chief Executive Officer, David Zaccardelli, and we do not have employment agreements with David S. Moore, our President and Chief Commercial Officer, Mark W. Hahn, our Chief Financial Officer, David W. Oldach, our Chief Medical Officer, John D. Bluth, our Executive Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, or any other employee. As a result, all employees are employed on an at-will basis, which means that any of these employees could leave our employment at any time, with or without notice, and may go to work for a competitor. Even though Dr. Zaccardelli has entered into an employment agreement with us, he could leave at any time. We do have change in control severance agreements with Mr. Moore, Mr. Hahn, Dr. Oldach, and Mr. Bluth, but any of these individuals could leave our employment at any time. While our agreements with Dr. Oldach and Messrs. Moore, Hahn and Bluth contain non-compete provisions, those provisions do not prevent any of these executives from leaving our employ. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could potentially harm our business, operating results or financial condition. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled scientific and medical personnel.\nOther biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and longer histories than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high quality candidates than what we offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to discover, develop and commercialize drug candidates will be limited.\nWhether our current product candidates are successful or not, our future growth will depend on our ability to identify, develop, acquire or in-license products and if we do not successfully identify develop, acquire or in-license additional product candidates or integrate them into our operations, we may have limited growth opportunities.\nAn important part of our business strategy is to continue to develop a pipeline of product candidates by developing, acquiring or in-licensing products, businesses or technologies that we believe are a strategic fit with our focus developing anti-infectives to treat infectious diseases. However, these business activities may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n\u2022\ninability to successfully identity new products candidates;\n\u2022\ndifficulty or inability to secure financing to fund development activities for such development, acquisition or in-licensed products or technologies;\n\u2022\nincurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of securities to pay for development, acquisition or in-licensing of new products;\n\u2022\ndisruption of our business and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention;\n\u2022\nhigher than expected development, acquisition or in-license and integration costs;\n\u2022\nexposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\ndifficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n\u2022\ninability to retain key employees of any acquired businesses;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in managing multiple product development programs; and\n\u2022\ninability to successfully develop new product candidates or clinical failure of new product candidates.\nWe have limited resources to identify and execute the development, acquisition or in-licensing of products, businesses and technologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure. We may compete with larger pharmaceutical companies and other competitors in our efforts to establish new collaborations and in-licensing opportunities. These competitors likely will have access to greater financial resources than us and may have greater expertise in identifying and evaluating new opportunities. Moreover, we may\ndevote resources to potential development, acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts.\nWe may need to grow our organization if we make progress on the development of any of our product candidates, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nAs of February 28, 2017, we had 45 employees. As our development and commercialization plans and strategies progress and develop, we may need to expand our employee base for managerial, operational, financial and other resources, including sales and marketing resources in preparation for any commercial launch of a product. Future growth would impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from their day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Future growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage any future growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate and/or grow revenues could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize solithromycin, fusidic acid and our other product candidates and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage any future growth in our organization.\nEven if we obtain FDA approval of solithromycin, or any other product candidate, we may never obtain approval or commercialize our products outside of the U.S., which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential. If foreign approval is obtained, there are risks in conducting business in international markets.\nIn order to market solithromycin or any other products outside of the U.S., we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approvals could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and require additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials which would be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries. Satisfying these and other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays.\nIn addition, our failure to obtain regulatory approval in the U.S. or any foreign country may delay or have negative effects on the process for regulatory approval in other countries. We do not know what impact if any the issuance of the CRL may have on our MAA filed with the EMA. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale in the U.S. or any foreign country and we do not have experience as a company in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in a foreign country or to obtain and maintain required approvals, our potential market for solithromycin or other products will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be harmed. We do not intend to commercialize fusidic acid outside the U.S. because of the widespread use of fusidic acid in Europe and Australia.\nIf approved for commercialization in a foreign country, we intend to enter into agreements with third parties to market solithromycin whenever it may be approved and wherever we have the right to market it. Consequently, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into international business relationships, including:\n\u2022\npotentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe potential for so-called parallel importing, which is what happens when a local seller, faced with high or higher local prices, opts to import goods from a foreign market (with low or lower prices) rather than buying them locally;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\ncompliance with laws for employees traveling abroad;\n\u2022\nforeign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting API and/or finished drug product supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad;\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires; and\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with Office of Foreign Asset Control rules and regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\nThese and other risks may materially adversely affect our ability to attain or sustain revenue from international markets.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of employee fraud or other misconduct. Misconduct by employees could include intentional failures to comply with FDA regulations, provide accurate information to the FDA, comply with federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations, report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the health care industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a Code of Conduct, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nTo raise additional funds to support our business operations, we may issue equity or debt securities. Debt securities could contain restrictive covenants that may adversely impact the operation of our business. The issuance of equity securities or convertible debt securities would result in dilution to our stockholders.\nThe incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in certain restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. For example, in July 2015, we entered into a loan agreement for $20.0 million with Comerica Bank that contains restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt, transfer or place a lien or security interest on our assets, including our intellectual property, merge with or acquire other companies, redeem any shares of our capital stock or pay cash dividends to our stockholders. Future debt securities or other financing arrangements could contain similar or more restrictive negative covenants than the Comerica Bank loan. In addition, the sale of equity securities or convertible debt securities would result in the issuance of additional shares of our capital stock, which would result in dilution to our stockholders.\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects.\nWe began operations in 2006. Our operations to date have been limited to financing and staffing our company, conducting product development activities for solithromycin and fusidic acid, engaging in commercial launch preparation activities for solithromycin, performing research and development with respect to our proprietary macrolide library. We have not yet demonstrated an ability as a company to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize a product candidate. Consequently, the ability to predict our future performance may not be as accurate as it could be if we had a history of successfully developing and commercializing pharmaceutical products.\nGovernment funding for any current or future development programs may be withheld, delayed or terminated for reasons beyond our control, or if we fail to carry out our contractual obligations or cease development of a product candidate.\nWe have an agreement with BARDA pursuant to which we are pursuing the evaluation and development of solithromycin for the treatment of bacterial infections in pediatric populations and infections caused by bioterror threat pathogens, specifically anthrax and tularemia. Funding for any government-sponsored or government-funded program is subject to withholding, delay or termination for reasons beyond our control. Further, funding could be reprioritized due to national or international developments. Epidemics, such as the recent crisis with Ebola, could cause government sponsors, including BARDA, to shift funding away from our program to address what the sponsor views as more pressing needs. BARDA also has the right to terminate its agreement with us at any time if the contracting officer determines that it is in the government\u2019s interest to do so.\nIn addition, if we fail to abide by our contractual obligations to any governmental entity, including BARDA, the entity generally would be able to terminate the agreement. Further, if we were to cease development of any product candidate for which we had a contract with a governmental entity, it would generally lead to the termination of such a contract, which could have adverse monetary implications for us, depending on the terms of the agreement. In the case of our agreement with BARDA, if we were to cease developing solithromycin, we would be in breach of the agreement and would lose the funding from BARDA and could, depending on the status of the work options at the time, could require us to pay our share of the one cost-sharing work option.\nIf we market any of our product candidates that receive approval in a manner that violates applicable health care laws, including laws prohibiting off-label promotion, disclosure laws or other similar laws, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\nAny regulatory approval of drug products is limited to those specific diseases and indications for which a product is deemed to be safe and effective by the FDA. In addition to the FDA approval required for new formulations, any new indication for an approved product also requires FDA approval. While physicians may choose to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and for uses that differ from those tested in clinical studies and approved by the regulatory authorities, our ability to promote the products is limited to those indications that are specifically approved by the FDA. Regulatory authorities in the United States generally do not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, and such off-label uses by healthcare professionals are common. Regulatory authorities do, however, restrict communications by pharmaceutical companies on the subject of off-label use. If we are not able to obtain FDA approval for any desired future indications for solithromycin, fusidic acid or any other product candidates that may be approved, our ability to market and sell such products will be limited and our business may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, in recent years, several states and localities have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials, health care provider payments and other activities. Additionally, the federal government has enacted the Physician Payment Sunshine Act which requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to report annually to the Secretary of Health and Human Services payments or other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals. If any of our product candidates are approved, we will be required to report certain information with respect to such payments. We also expect to have to comply with similar reporting obligations in foreign countries. We will need to expend significant efforts to establish, maintain and enhance such reporting systems and processes in order to comply with these regulations. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements would result in significant civil monetary penalties. The Affordable Care Act also includes various provisions designed to strengthen significantly fraud and abuse enforcement, such as increased funding for enforcement efforts and the lowering of the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback statute and criminal health care fraud statute such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe are subject to extensive and costly government regulation.\nAntibiotics, including those we are developing and plan to develop in the future, are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic government regulation including regulation by the FDA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, state and local governments and their respective foreign equivalents. The FDA regulates the research, development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, record keeping, reporting, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import and export of pharmaceutical products. If any products we develop are tested or marketed abroad, they will also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments, whether or not we have obtained FDA approval for a given product and its uses. Such foreign regulation may be equally or more demanding than corresponding U.S. regulation. Government regulation substantially increases the cost and risk of researching, developing, manufacturing and selling products. Our failure to comply with these regulations could result in significant fines or the inability of our product candidates to obtain and maintain regulatory approval, which would have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for solithromycin, fusidic acid or any of our future product candidates, we will still face extensive regulatory requirements and our products may face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven if regulatory approval in the U.S. is obtained, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance. For example, the labeling ultimately approved for solithromycin will include, and for fusidic acid may include, restrictions on use. Solithromycin, fusidic acid or any of our other product candidates will also be subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, record keeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. The holder of an approved NDA is subject to obligations to monitor and report adverse events and instances\nof the failure of a product to meet the specifications in the NDA. Application holders must submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. Application holders must also submit advertising and other promotional material to the FDA and report on ongoing clinical trials. Legal requirements have also been enacted to require disclosure of clinical trial results on publicly available databases.\nIn addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations. If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing, requiring new warnings or other labeling changes to limit use of the drug, requiring that we conduct additional clinical trials, imposing new monitoring requirements, or requiring that we establish risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS. Advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws. The distribution of product samples to physicians must comply with the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act. Sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the False Claims Act and similar state laws, each as amended. Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veteran\u2019s Health Care Act of 1992, each as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. If we or our third party collaborators fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022\nconduct an investigation into our practices and any alleged violation of law;\n\u2022\nissue warning letters or untitled letters asserting that we are in violation of the law;\n\u2022\nseek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u2022\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us;\n\u2022\nsuspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements;\n\u2022\nseize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall; or\n\u2022\nrefuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may force us to expend significant amounts of time and money and may significantly inhibit our ability to bring to market or continue to market our products and generate revenues. Similar regulations apply in foreign jurisdictions.\nProduct liability lawsuits could divert our resources, result in substantial liabilities and reduce the commercial potential of our products.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates despite obtaining appropriate informed consents from our clinical trial participants, and will face an even greater risk if we commercialize solithromycin or fusidic acid in the U.S. or other additional jurisdictions or if we engage in the clinical testing of new product candidates or commercialize any additional products. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. The liver toxicity issues raised by the FDA in its CRL for our NDAs for solithromycin for the treatment of CABP and the label warning, if solithromycin is approved, may heighten the risk of lawsuits if injuries appear to be caused by solithromycin. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our products or product candidates that we may develop;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022\ninitiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u2022\ncosts to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\na diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022\nexhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize our products or product candidates; and\n\u2022\na decline in our stock price.\nAlthough we maintain general liability insurance of up to $2.0 million in the aggregate and clinical trial liability insurance of $10.0 million in the aggregate for each of solithromycin and fusidic acid, this insurance may not fully cover potential liabilities. The cost of any product liability litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. In addition, inability to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the development and commercial production and sale of our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf we use hazardous and biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages.\nOur research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including chemical, biological and radioactive materials and viruses. In addition, our operations produce hazardous waste products. Federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S. govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials. We may incur significant additional costs to comply with applicable laws in the future. We also cannot predict the impact on our business of new or amended environmental laws or regulations, or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced. Also, even if we are in compliance with applicable laws, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials, and we may incur liability as a result of any such contamination or injury. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines, and the liability could exceed our resources, and we do not carry liability insurance covering the use of hazardous materials. If we fail to comply with applicable requirements, we could incur substantial costs, including civil or criminal fines and penalties, clean-up costs, or capital expenditures for control equipment or operational changes necessary to achieve or maintain compliance. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts, which adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nOur ability to pursue the development and commercialization of solithromycin depends upon the continuation of our licenses from Optimer and The Scripps Research Institute.\nOur agreement with Optimer (now owned by Merck) provides us with a worldwide exclusive license to develop and sell solithromycin outside of ASEAN countries. We are obligated to use our diligent efforts to develop and commercialize products licensed from Optimer. We have other obligations to Optimer under the license related to progress reporting, payment terms and confidentiality. If we do not continue to use diligent efforts to develop and commercialize solithromycin, if we are unable to make the required milestone and royalty payments under the agreement or if we otherwise materially breach the agreement, our rights to develop and commercialize solithromycin would terminate and revert to Optimer. In addition, either we or Optimer may terminate the agreement upon the uncured material breach of the agreement or upon the other party\u2019s bankruptcy. If our agreement with Optimer is terminated by Optimer, we would lose our rights to develop and commercialize solithromycin, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nOur agreement with The Scripps Research Institute, or TSRI, provides us with a license to make, use, sell, and import products for human or animal therapeutic use that use or incorporate one or more macrolides as an active pharmaceutical ingredient and is covered by certain patent rights owned by TSRI claiming technology related to copper-catalyzed ligation of azides and acetylenes, with exclusive rights as to the People\u2019s Republic of China (excluding Hong Kong), South Korea and Australia, and non-exclusive rights in all other countries worldwide, except the member-nations of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (which are not\nincluded in the license with TSRI). We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approvals to market and sell one or more licensed products. TSRI may terminate the agreement due to our insolvency, our conviction for a felony relating to the development, manufacture, use, marketing, distribution or sale of a licensed product, or upon an uncured breach of the agreement by us, including failure to make any required payment. If our agreement with TSRI is terminated by TSRI, we could lose our rights to synthesize and/or manufacture solithromycin under the licensed TSRI technology, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nAnother party could develop a fusidic acid product and achieve FDA regulatory exclusivity in the U.S. before we do, potentially preventing our ability to commercialize fusidic acid.\nWe will rely partly on FDA regulatory exclusivity to protect our proprietary rights for fusidic acid, our fusidic acid product, in the U.S. fusidic acid has been approved and sold for several decades in Europe and countries outside the U.S., but it has never been approved in the U.S. We believe this was due to the lack of regulatory exclusivity that was available for the molecule until the passage of Public Law 110-379 on October 8, 2008, which allowed old antibiotics such as fusidic acid to obtain five-year new chemical entity, or NCE, exclusivity upon NDA approval. This exclusivity will be granted to the first fusidic acid product that receives NDA approval. During the exclusivity period, for a minimum of four years the FDA will not accept an application filed by a third party that relies on any data contained in the approved NDA. Although we are not aware of another party currently developing fusidic acid for use in the U.S. for any indication, if another party were to do so and obtain NDA approval before we do, we would not be able to obtain approval for Fusidic acid for any disease until after any period of regulatory exclusivity if our NDA relies on data contained in the previously approved NDA. In that event, we may not be able to commercialize fusidic acid, which would harm our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability.\nOur competitive position may be harmed if a competitor obtains orphan drug exclusivity for the treatment of prosthetic joint infections or refractory bone and joint infections before we do. Even if we were to obtain orphan drug exclusivity, a competitor could obtain approval of a different drug for the treatment of prosthetic joint infections or refractory bone and joint infections or for the same drug upon a showing that its drug is clinically superior to ours, which would harm our business.\nOrphan drug designation is an important element of our competitive strategy for fusidic acid. The company that obtains the first FDA approval for a drug that is designated as an orphan drug for a rare disease receives a type of marketing exclusivity known as \u201corphan drug exclusivity.\u201d Orphan drug exclusivity prevents FDA approval of applications by others for the same drug and the designated orphan disease or condition for seven years from the date of NDA approval. If the orphan indication is the first NDA approved for the drug, the drug is also eligible for the five-year Hatch-Waxman exclusivity for NCEs. Orphan and Hatch-Waxman exclusivities run concurrently. The FDA has designated fusidic acid as an orphan drug for the treatment of PJI. We will work to have orphan drug designation granted for fusidic acid for refractory bone and joint infections.\nThe FDA may approve a subsequent application from another entity for the orphan indication of prosthetic joint infections or refractory bone and joint infections if it determines that the application is for a different drug. The FDA may also approve a subsequent application for fusidic acid for an indication other than prosthetic joint infections or refractory bone and joint infections. Orphan exclusivity does not block the same drug from being approved for another indication; however, Hatch-Waxman exclusivity could block submission for a period of at least four years after approval if the subsequent application references data in the earlier NDA.\nThe FDA may approve a subsequent application from another entity for the same drug for the same designated and approved orphan indication during the orphan exclusivity period if it determines that the subsequent product is clinically superior, or that the holder of the initial orphan drug approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the public\u2019s need.\nIf we do not receive orphan exclusivity for fusidic acid for the treatment of prosthetic joint infections or refractory bone and joint infections, our business would be negatively affected. In addition, even if we do obtain orphan exclusivity for fusidic acid, the FDA may permit other companies to market other drugs for the same condition or use. In addition, the FDA may approve another fusidic acid product for prosthetic joint infections or refractory bone and joint infections during our period of orphan drug exclusivity if it can be demonstrated that the drug is clinically superior to our drug, or if we are unable to supply sufficient product to meet the public\u2019s need. This could create a more competitive market for us.\nIf our efforts to protect the proprietary nature of the intellectual property related to solithromycin, fusidic acid, and our other product candidates are not adequate, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain additional patents and protect our existing patent position as well as our ability to maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for solithromycin, fusidic acid and any future products in the U.S. and other countries. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability. The patent positions of pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain. The legal principles applicable to patents are in\ntransition due to changing court precedent and legislative action and we cannot assure you that the historical legal standards surrounding questions of validity will continue to be applied or that current defenses relating to issued patents in these fields will be sufficient in the future. Changes in patent laws in the U.S. such as the America Invents Act of 2011 may affect the scope, strength and enforceability of our patent rights or the nature of proceedings which may be brought by us related to our patent rights. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these countries. We will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies, solithromycin, fusidic acid and any future products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.\nThese risks include the possibility that:\n\u2022\nthe patent applications that we licensed or have filed on our own may fail to result in issued patents in the U.S. or in foreign countries;\n\u2022\npatents issued or licensed to us or our partners may be challenged, discovered to have been issued on the basis of insufficient or incorrect information and/or held to be invalid or unenforceable;\n\u2022\nthe scope of any patent protection may be too narrow to exclude other competitors from developing or designing around these patents;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors were not the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents and pending patent applications;\n\u2022\nwe or our licensors were not the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to comply with procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process, which can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights;\n\u2022\nfuture product candidates may not be patentable;\n\u2022\nothers will claim rights or ownership with regard to patents and other proprietary rights which we hold or license;\n\u2022\ndelays in development, testing, clinical trials and regulatory review may reduce the period of time during which we could market our product candidates under patent protection; and\n\u2022\nwe may fail to timely apply for patents on our technologies or products.\nWhile we apply for patents covering both our technologies and potential products, including solithromycin and fusidic acid, as we deem appropriate, many biopharmaceutical companies and university and research institutions already have filed patent applications or have received patents in our areas of product development. These entities\u2019 applications, patents and other intellectual property rights may conflict with patent applications to which we have rights and could prevent us from obtaining patents or could call into question the validity of any of our patents, if issued, or could otherwise adversely affect our ability to develop, manufacture or commercialize antibiotic candidates. In addition, if third parties file patent applications in the technologies that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference, derivation or other proceedings with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or applicable foreign patent regulatory authorities, as applicable, to determine our rights in the invention, which may be time-consuming and expensive. Moreover, issued patents may be challenged during post-grant proceedings brought by a third party or the USPTO, or in foreign countries, or in the courts. These proceedings may result in loss of patent claims or adverse changes to the scope of the claims. Patent applications may also be challenged during pre-grant proceedings. If we are unsuccessful in defending any such opposition, only part of such patent would issue or the patent might not issue at all.\nIf we or our licensors or partners fail to obtain and maintain patent protection for our product candidates, or our proprietary technologies and their uses, companies may be dissuaded from collaborating with us. In such event, our ability to commercialize solithromycin, fusidic acid and our other product candidates may be threatened, we could lose our competitive advantage and the competition we face could increase, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, litigation will be costly and time consuming and could prevent us or delay us from developing or commercializing our product candidates.\nOur commercial success depends, in part, on our not infringing the patents and proprietary rights of other parties and not breaching any collaboration or other agreements we have entered into with regard to our technologies and products. Numerous third-party U.S. and non-U.S. issued patents and pending applications exist in the areas of antibacterial treatment, including compounds, formulations, treatment methods and synthetic processes that may be applied towards the synthesis of antibiotics. Although no legal\naction has been commenced or threatened against us by a third party for infringing intellectual property rights, we cannot provide assurances that we or our partners will be free to manufacture or market our product candidates as planned, or that we or our licensors\u2019 and partners\u2019 patents will not be opposed or litigated by third parties.\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation involving intellectual property in the biopharmaceutical industry generally. If a third party asserts that we infringe its patents or other proprietary rights, we could face a number of risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects, including:\n\u2022\ninfringement and other intellectual property claims, which would be costly and time consuming to defend, whether or not we are ultimately successful, which in turn could delay the regulatory approval process, consume our capital and divert management\u2019s attention from our business;\n\u2022\nsubstantial damages for past infringement, which we may have to pay if a court determines that our products or technologies infringe a competitor\u2019s patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\na court prohibiting us from selling or licensing our technologies or future products unless the third party licenses its patents or other proprietary rights to us on commercially reasonable terms, which it is not required to do;\n\u2022\nif a license is available from a third party, we may have to pay substantial royalties or lump sum payments or grant cross licenses to our patents or other proprietary rights to obtain that license; and\n\u2022\nredesigning our products so they do not infringe, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time.\nAlthough we are not currently party to any legal proceedings relating to our intellectual property, in the future, third parties may file claims asserting that our technologies, processes or products infringe on their intellectual property. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert these claims against us or our partners or against the licensors of technology licensed to us, or whether those claims will harm our business. In addition, the outcome of intellectual property litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance. If we or our partners were to face infringement claims or challenges by third parties relating to our product candidates, an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to such third parties, and force us or our partners to curtail or cease the development of some or all of our product candidates, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe may be required to file lawsuits or take other actions to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our licensors, which could be expensive and time consuming.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our licensors. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are concluded. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally.\nIn addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents, or those of our licensors, do not cover the technology in question. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents, or those of our licensors, at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications, or those of our licensors, at risk of not issuing. Moreover, we may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our proprietary rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the U.S. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, if securities analysts or investors perceive public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments to be negative, the price of our common stock could be adversely affected. The occurrence of any of the above could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nThe intellectual property protection for our product candidates is dependent on third parties.\nWith respect to patents and patent applications relating to solithromycin or other compounds licensed from Optimer (now owned by Merck), Optimer retains rights in ASEAN countries. Generally, we do not have the right to prosecute and maintain any applications in those countries, unless Optimer elects not to file, prosecute or maintain any or all of such patent applications. Our potential future licensors also may retain the right to prosecute and maintain the patent rights that they license to us. If Optimer or other licensors fail to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for any of our product candidates in those countries\ncontrolled by them, our ability to develop and commercialize those product candidates may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products in those countries.\nWith respect to inventions that are jointly made by us and one of our licensors, partners or potential partners, we would need to determine, with our licensors, partners or potential partners, who would be responsible for the prosecution of patents relating to any joint inventions should they arise. In addition, we may be required to cede control of prosecution of our patents to partners or potential partners in order to consummate a partnering transaction. If any of our licensors or partners fails to appropriately prosecute and maintain patent protection for any of our product candidates in those countries controlled by them, our ability to develop and commercialize those product candidates may be adversely affected and we may not be able to prevent competitors from making, using and selling competing products in those countries.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of certain information, the value of our product candidates and technology could be materially adversely affected.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advancement to develop and maintain our competitive position. To protect this competitive position, we regularly enter into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with third parties, including employees, independent contractors, suppliers and collaborators. We cannot, however, ensure that these protective arrangements will be honored by third parties, and we may not have adequate remedies if these arrangements are breached. In addition, enforcement of claims that a third party has illegally obtained and is using trade secrets, know-how and technological advancements is expensive, time consuming and uncertain. Non-U.S. courts are sometimes less willing than U.S. courts to protect this information. Moreover, our trade secrets, know-how and technological advancements may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors in a manner providing us with no practical recourse against the competing parties. If any such events were to occur, they could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe have not yet registered our trademarks in all of our potential markets, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business.\nWe have filed applications with the USPTO for marks for our two current product candidates; however, we cannot guarantee that either application will be allowed, or whether the USPTO will ultimately issue a trademark registration in respect to those applications. In addition, although we are not currently aware of any oppositions to or cancellations of our registered trademarks or pending applications, it is possible that one or more of the applications could be subject to opposition or cancellation after the marks are registered. The registrations will be subject to use and maintenance requirements. We have not yet registered all of our trademarks in all of our potential markets and there are names or symbols other than \u201cCempra\u201d that may be protectable marks for which we have not sought registration. Failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our business. We cannot assure you that opposition or cancellation proceedings will not be filed against our trademarks or that our trademarks would survive such proceedings.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that these employees, or we, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Such claims may lead to material costs for us, or an inability to protect or use valuable intellectual property rights, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nWe are subject to a putative securities class action and a shareholder derivative lawsuit, which may require significant management time and attention and significant legal expenses and may result in unfavorable outcomes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn November 4, 2016, a securities class action lawsuit was commenced in the United States District Court, Middle District of North Carolina, Durham Division, naming our company and certain of our officers as defendants, and alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with allegedly false and misleading statements made by the defendants between May 1, 2016 and November 1, 2016, or the Class Period. The plaintiff seeks to represent a class comprised of purchasers of our common stock during the Class Period and seeks damages, costs and expenses and such other relief as determined by the Court. Two substantially similar lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court, Middle District of North Carolina on November 22, 2016 and December 30, 2016. We believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend the lawsuit vigorously. It is possible that similar lawsuits may yet be filed in the same or other courts that name the same or additional defendants.\nOn December 21, 2016, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was commenced in the North Carolina Durham County Superior Court, naming certain of our former and current officers and directors as defendants and our company as a nominal defendant, and asserting claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and corporate waste. A substantially similar lawsuit was filed in the North Carolina Durham County Superior Court on February 16, 2017. The complaint is based on similar allegations as asserted in the securities lawsuits described above, and seeks unspecified damages and attorneys' fees. It is possible that similar lawsuits may yet be filed in the same or other courts that name the same or additional defendants. We believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously.\nWhile we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims in these lawsuits and intend to vigorously defend the cases, these lawsuits could divert management\u2019s attention from our ordinary business operations. Further, the outcome of this litigation is difficult to predict and quantify, and the defense against this litigation could be costly. The ultimate resolution of these cases could result in payments of monetary damages or other costs, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, or adversely affect our reputation, and consequently, could negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have various insurance policies related to the risks associated with our business, including directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policies. However, there is no assurance that our insurance coverage will be sufficient or that our insurance carriers will cover all claims in that litigation. If we are not successful in our defense of the claims asserted in these cases and those claims are not covered by insurance or exceed our insurance coverage, we may have to pay damage awards, indemnify our officers from damage awards that may be entered against them and pay the costs and expenses incurred in defense of, or in any settlement of, such claims.\nIn addition, it is possible that similar lawsuits may be filed in the future in the same or other courts that name the same or additional defendants, in which case we could be similarly materially and adversely affected by such additional litigation.\nThe trading market for our common stock may not provide our stockholders with adequate liquidity.\nPrior to February 3, 2012, there had not been a public market for our common stock. Our common stock has at time been thinly traded and may be so again. We cannot assure you that an active trading market for our common stock will be maintained. You may not be able to sell your shares quickly or at the market price if trading in our common stock is not active.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nOur stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market on February 3, 2012. Between that date and February 24, 2017, it has traded between $2.55 and $46.99. Our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, which include:\n\u2022\nthe inability to address the issues raised in the CRL issued by the FDA for our NDAs for solithromycin for the treatment of CABP or unanticipated delays in addressing the issues raised in the CRL;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory decisions, including any for our applications for solithromycin as a treatment for CABP;\n\u2022\nour ability to realize the benefits from our cost-savings initiatives;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain key employees and other staff to adequately manage our operations;\n\u2022\nour ability to identify and negotiate any strategic business opportunities;\n\u2022\nmarket perception of risks associated with solithromycin;\n\u2022\nmarket perception of, and our experience in dealing with, the impact of our recent reduction in force and our ability to retain staff sufficient to operate our company effectively;\n\u2022\nunanticipated serious safety concerns related to the use of solithromycin, fusidic acid or any of our other product candidates;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning our manufacturing sources for solithromycin;\n\u2022\nour cash position and investor concerns about our need for additional financing as well as our ability to raise capital and the timing and dilutive impact of any future financing transactions;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning our other sources of manufacturing supply and any commercialization partners;\n\u2022\nany delay in enrollment of our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial for solithromycin for gonorrhea or any other clinical trial or study we undertake;\n\u2022\nadverse results or delays in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nany delay in filing our NDA for fusidic acid and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the FDA\u2019s review of the NDA, including without limitation the FDA\u2019s issuance of a \u201crefusal to file\u201d letter or a request for additional information;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our products or product candidates, including but not limited to clinical trial requirements for approvals;\n\u2022\na decision to initiate a clinical trial, not to initiate a clinical trial or to terminate an existing clinical trial;\n\u2022\nthe inability to obtain adequate product supply for solithromycin, fusidic acid or any other approved drug product, or the inability to do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of new products or technologies offered by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our or our potential partners\u2019 commercialization efforts;\n\u2022\nthe inability to effectively manage our growth;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nthe failure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community;\n\u2022\nthe perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community;\n\u2022\nthe overall performance of the U.S. equity markets and general political and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nannouncements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u2022\nadverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future;\n\u2022\nsignificant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in the market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nthe trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\neffects of natural or man-made catastrophic events or other business interruptions; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the NASDAQ Global Market and the stock of biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAt January 31, 2017, our executive officers, directors and entities affiliated with certain of our directors beneficially owned approximately 12.6% of our outstanding voting common stock. Therefore, these stockholders have the ability to influence us through their ownership position. These stockholders may be able to determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders may be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may feel are in your best interest as one of our stockholders.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain proper internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nSEC rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act require us to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for that purpose. We first became subject to this requirement for our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. While we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2015, there can be no assurance that we will be able to so conclude in the future or that we will not\nidentify one or more material weaknesses in our internal controls in connection with future evaluations. Additionally, in the past we had opted to rely on the exemptions provided in the JOBS Act regarding independent auditor assessments of internal controls over financial reporting. Beginning with the year ended December 31, 2015, when we ceased to be an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d however, we now must provide our independent registered accounting firm\u2019s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting in each Annual Report on Form 10-K. Investors may lose confidence in our operating results, our stock price could decline and we may be subject to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions if (i) in the future we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, (ii) we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which could result in financial statement errors which, in turn, could require us to restate our operating results or (iii) our independent auditors are unwilling or unable to provide us with an attestation report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Any of these events could cause investors to lose confidence in our operating results, our stock price could decline and we may be subject to litigation or regulatory enforcement actions. In addition, if we are unable to meet the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we may not be able to remain listed on the NASDAQ Global Market.\nWe might not be able to maintain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market.\nOur common stock began listing on the Nasdaq Global Market on February 3, 2012, under the symbol \u201cCEMP.\u201d We might not be able to maintain the listing standards of that exchange. If we fail to maintain the listing requirements, our common stock might trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or move to the OTC Bulletin Board or in the \u201cpink sheets\u201d maintained by Pink OTC Markets, Inc. The OTC Bulletin Board and the \u201cpink sheets\u201d are generally considered to be markets that are less efficient and less broad than the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. A limited number of securities and industry analysts currently publish research on our company. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry-forwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, referred to as the Internal Revenue Code, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d (generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in its equity ownership over a three-year period), the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. We believe that, with the financing transactions that have occurred throughout our history, we may have triggered one or more \u201cownership change\u201d limitations. We may also experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carry-forwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which potentially could result in increased future tax liability to us.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock so any returns will be limited to the value of our stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital shares. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings to support our operations and finance the growth and development of our business. We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. In addition, under our loan and security agreement with Comerica Bank, we are prohibited from declaring or paying any cash dividends. Any future determination related to dividend policy will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital requirements, business prospects and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if an acquisition would benefit our stockholders, and could also make it more difficult to remove our current management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nlimiting the removal of directors by the stockholders;\n\u2022\ncreating a staggered board of directors;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by the board of directors. This provision could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing someone from acquiring us or merging with us, whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 13263, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "MLNTQ"}
