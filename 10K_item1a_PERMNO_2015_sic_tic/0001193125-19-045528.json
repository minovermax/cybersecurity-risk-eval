{"cik": "775368", "company": "ALLEGHANY CORP /DE", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur operating businesses and investments are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below, which could have a material and adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. Our businesses may also be materially and adversely affected by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial.\nRisk Factors Related to our Business\nThe reserves for loss and LAE of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are estimates and may not be adequate, which would require our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries to establish additional reserves. Gross reserves for loss and LAE reported on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 were approximately $12.3 billion. These loss and LAE reserves reflect management\u2019s best estimates of the cost of settling all claims and related expenses with respect to insured events that have occurred. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but rather an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claims administration will cost for events that have occurred, whether known or unknown. These reserve estimates, which generally involve actuarial projections, are based on management\u2019s assessment of facts and circumstances currently known and assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns, including expected future trends in claims severity and frequency, inflation, court resolutions and judicial interpretations, reinsurance coverage, legislative changes and other factors.\nThe inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities, where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made and settlement is reached. Our liabilities for loss and LAE can generally be categorized into two distinct groups, short-tail business and long-tail business. Short-tail business refers to lines of business, such as property, for which losses are usually known and paid relatively soon after the loss actually occurs. Long-tail business describes lines of business for which specific losses may not be known and reported for some period and losses take much longer to emerge. Given the time frame over which long-tail exposures are ultimately settled, there is greater uncertainty and volatility in these lines than in short-tail lines of business. Our long-tail coverages consist of most casualty lines of business including professional\nliability, directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability, general liability, umbrella/excess liability and certain workers\u2019 compensation exposures. Some factors that contribute to the uncertainty and volatility of long-tail casualty business, and thus require a significant degree of judgment in the reserving process, include the inherent uncertainty as to the length of reporting and payment development patterns, the possibility of judicial interpretations or legislative changes that might impact future loss experience relative to prior loss experience and the potential lack of comparability of the underlying data used in performing loss reserve analyses. In general, reinsurance business for any particular line of business is longer-tailed and, by its nature, losses are more difficult to estimate than they are for comparable insurance business.\nIn periods with increased economic volatility, it becomes more difficult to accurately predict claims costs. It is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions. Reserve estimates are continually refined in an ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled. Adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the periods in which the adjustments are made. Because setting reserves is inherently uncertain, our current reserves could prove to be too low or too high in light of subsequent events. Should our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries need to increase or decrease their reserves, our pre-tax income for the period would decrease or increase, respectively, by a corresponding amount. Although current reserves reflect our best estimate of the costs of settling claims, we cannot assure you that our reserve estimates will not change, perhaps by a material amount, in the future.\nBecause our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are property and casualty reinsurers and insurers, we face losses related to natural and man-made catastrophes. Property and casualty reinsurers and insurers are subject to claims arising out of catastrophes that may have a significant effect on their results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Catastrophe losses, or the absence thereof, have historically had a significant impact on our results.\nNatural or man-made catastrophes can be caused by various events, including hurricanes, other windstorms, earthquakes, floods wildfires, as well as terrorist activities. The frequency and severity of catastrophes in any short period of time are inherently unpredictable. The extent of gross losses related to a catastrophe event is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event, potentially mitigated by any reinsurance coverage purchased by our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries. Most catastrophes are restricted to limited geographic areas; however, hurricanes, other windstorms, earthquakes and floods may produce significant damage when those areas are heavily populated. It is therefore possible that a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could produce significant losses and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures, and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain and snow. Climate change, to the extent it produces rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns, could impact the frequency or severity of weather events such as hurricanes, tornado activity, other windstorms and wildfires. To the extent climate change increases the frequency and severity of such weather events, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries, particularly TransRe and RSUI, may face increased claims, particularly with respect to properties located in coastal areas. Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries take certain measures to mitigate the impact of such events by considering these risks in their underwriting and pricing decisions, including their management of aggregate exposure levels and through the purchase of reinsurance. To the extent broad environmental factors, exacerbated by climate change or otherwise, lead to increases in insured losses, particularly if those losses exceed the expectations of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWith respect to terrorism, to the extent that reinsurers have excluded coverage for certain terrorist acts or have priced this coverage at rates that make purchasing such coverage uneconomic, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries will not have reinsurance protection and are exposed to potential losses as a result of any acts of terrorism. To the extent an act of terrorism is certified by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, we may be covered under the Terrorism Act. This coverage under the Terrorism Act does not apply to reinsurers. Information regarding the Terrorism Act and its impact on our insurance subsidiaries can be found on page 46 of this Form 10-K.\nIn general, TransRe does not provide coverage for certified acts of terrorism, as defined by the Terrorism Act, but it is nonetheless exposed to potential losses related to both certified and uncertified acts of terrorism in the U.S. or elsewhere, such as from terrorism-specific treaty coverages offered to ceding companies or terrorism risk pools outside of the U.S. on a limited basis, and with respect to other lines of business from the assumption of terrorism risk in marine, aviation and other casualty treaties. Although TransRe assumes such terrorism risk after careful underwriting consideration and, in many cases, with limitations, a major terrorist event could have a material adverse impact on TransRe and us.\nFinally, other catastrophes, such as an outbreak of a pandemic disease, the bankruptcy of a major company or a marine or aviation disaster, could also have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nSignificant competitive pressures may prevent our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries from retaining existing business or writing new business at adequate rates. Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries compete with a large number of other companies in their selected lines of business. They compete, and will continue to compete, with major U.S. and non-U.S. reinsurers and insurers, other regional companies, mutual companies, specialty insurance companies, underwriting agencies, government-owned or subsidized facilities, European underwriting syndicates and diversified financial services companies. Many competitors have considerably more financial resources, greater experience and may offer more products or services than our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries. Except for regulatory considerations, there are virtually no barriers to entry into the reinsurance and insurance industry.\nAdditionally, the reinsurance and insurance industry continues to consolidate and, accordingly, competition for customers will continue to increase. As a result, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries may incur greater customer retention and acquisition expense, which would affect the profitability of existing and new business. Further, as the industry continues to consolidate, reinsurance and insurance companies that merge could have increased market size and capital resources with which to negotiate price reductions and retain more risk, decreasing pricing and demand for reinsurance.\nCompetition in the businesses of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries is based on many factors, including the perceived financial strength of a company, premiums charged, other terms and conditions offered, services provided, commissions paid to producers, ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, speed of claims payment and reputation and experience in the lines to be written. Such competition could cause the supply or demand for insurance to change, which could affect the ability of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries to price their products at adequate rates. If our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are unable to retain existing business or write new business at adequate rates, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition to competition from the reinsurance industry, TransRe faces competition from the capital markets, as well as some traditional reinsurers, which from time to time produce alternative products or reinsurance vehicles (such as collateralized reinsurance, reinsurance securitizations, catastrophe bonds and various derivatives, such as swaps and sidecars) that may compete with certain types of reinsurance, such as property catastrophe. Hedge funds may also provide reinsurance and retrocessional protections through captive companies or other alternative transactions on a fully collateralized basis for property and energy catastrophe business. Over time, these initiatives could significantly affect supply, pricing and competition in the reinsurance industry.\nOur results may fluctuate as a result of many factors, including cyclical changes in the reinsurance and insurance industries. Historically, the performance of the property and casualty reinsurance and insurance industries has tended to fluctuate in cyclical periods of price competition and excess underwriting capacity, followed by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity. Although an individual reinsurance and insurance company\u2019s performance is dependent on its own specific business characteristics, the profitability of most property and casualty reinsurance and insurance companies tends to follow this market cycle. Further, this cyclical market pattern can be more pronounced in the reinsurance market in which TransRe competes and in the excess and surplus market in which RSUI primarily competes than in the standard insurance market. In addition, compared with historical cyclical periods, a cycle of increased price competition and excess underwriting capacity may continue for a prolonged period of time as new and existing reinsurance and insurance market participants and products continue to enter the reinsurance and insurance markets. Unfavorable market conditions may affect the ability of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries to write business at rates they consider appropriate relative to the risk assumed. If we cannot write business at appropriate rates, our business would be significantly and adversely affected.\nWhen premium rates are high and there is a shortage of capacity in the standard insurance market, growth in the excess and surplus market can be significantly more rapid than growth in the standard insurance market. Similarly, when there is price competition and excess underwriting capacity in the standard insurance market, many customers that were previously driven into the excess and surplus market may return to the standard insurance market, exacerbating the effects of price competition.\nDemand for reinsurance is influenced significantly by underwriting and investment results in both the standard insurance and the excess and surplus markets and market conditions. The supply of reinsurance is related to prevailing prices, the levels of insured losses and the levels of reinsurance industry surplus, among other factors, that, in turn, may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being earned in the reinsurance industry. In addition, the supply of reinsurance is affected by a reinsurer\u2019s confidence in its ability to accurately assess the probability of expected underwriting outcomes, particularly with respect to catastrophe losses.\nSince cyclicality is due in large part to the collective actions of insurers, reinsurers and general economic conditions and the occurrence of unpredictable events, we cannot predict the timing or duration of changes in the market cycle. These cyclical patterns cause our revenues and net earnings to fluctuate. In addition, our results may fluctuate as a result of changes in economic, legal, political and social factors, among others.\nWe cannot guarantee that the reinsurers used by our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries will pay in a timely fashion, if at all, and, as a result, we could experience losses even if reinsured. As part of their overall risk and capacity management strategy, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries purchase reinsurance by transferring or ceding part of the risk that they have underwritten to a reinsurance company in exchange for part of the premium received by our subsidiaries in connection with that risk. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries remain liable for amounts not paid by a reinsurer.\nReinsurers may not pay the reinsurance recoverables that they owe to our subsidiaries or they may not pay these recoverables on a timely basis. This risk may increase significantly if these reinsurers experience financial difficulties as a result of catastrophes, investment losses or other events. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries\u2019 reinsurers, and if they fail to pay, our financial results would be adversely affected. As of December 31, 2018, reinsurance recoverables reported on our balance sheet were $1.9 billion.\nIf market conditions cause reinsurance to be more costly or unavailable, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries may be required to bear increased risks or reduce the level of their underwriting commitments. As part of their overall risk management strategy, our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries purchase reinsurance for certain amounts of risk underwritten by them, including catastrophe risks. The reinsurance programs purchased by our subsidiaries are generally subject to annual renewal. Market conditions beyond their control determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection they purchase, which may affect the level of their business written and thus their profitability. If our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are unable to renew their expiring facilities or to obtain new reinsurance facilities, which could result as the number of companies offering reinsurance coverage declines due to industry consolidation, either their net exposures on future policies or reinsurance contracts would increase, which could increase the volatility of their results or, if they are unwilling or unable to bear an increase in net exposures, they would have to reduce the level of their underwriting commitments, especially catastrophe-exposed risks, which may reduce their revenues and net earnings. In certain reinsurance contracts, a cedant, to the extent it exhausts its original coverage under a reinsurance contract during a single coverage period (typically a single twelve-month period), can pay a reinsurance reinstatement premium to restore coverage during such coverage period. If our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries exhaust their original and, if applicable, reinstated coverage under their third-party reinsurance contracts during a single coverage period, they will not have any reinsurance coverage available for losses incurred as a result of additional loss events during that coverage period. The exhaustion of such reinsurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries in any given period and on our results of operations.\nTransRe and RSUI attempt to manage their exposure to catastrophe risk partially through the use of catastrophe modeling software. The failure of this software to accurately gauge the catastrophe-exposed risks they write could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As part of their approach to managing catastrophe risk, TransRe and RSUI use a number of tools, including third-party catastrophe modeling software, to help evaluate potential losses. TransRe and RSUI use modeled loss scenarios and internal analyses to set their level of risk retention and help structure their reinsurance programs. Modeled loss estimates, however, have not always accurately predicted their ultimate losses with respect to catastrophe events. Accordingly, TransRe and RSUI periodically review their catastrophe exposure management approach, which may result in the implementation of new monitoring tools and a revision of their underwriting guidelines and procedures. However, these efforts may not be successful in sufficiently mitigating risk exposures and losses resulting from future catastrophes.\nOur reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are rated by rating agencies and a decline in these ratings could affect the standings of these units in the reinsurance and insurance industries and cause their premium volume and earnings to decrease. Ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive positions of reinsurance and insurance companies. Some of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are rated by A.M. Best, S&P and/or Moody\u2019s, which we collectively refer to as the \u201cRating Agencies.\u201d The Rating Agencies\u2019 financial strength ratings reflect their opinions of a reinsurance or an insurance company\u2019s financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders, and are neither an evaluation directed to investors of a security nor a recommendation to buy, sell or hold a security. These ratings are subject to periodic review, and we cannot assure you that any of our reinsurance or insurance companies will be able to retain their current ratings. If the ratings of our reinsurance or insurance companies are reduced from their current levels by the Rating Agencies, their competitive positions could suffer and it would be more difficult for them to market their products. A significant downgrade could result in a substantial loss of business as customers move to other companies with higher financial strength ratings.\nIn addition, in general, if the financial strength ratings of TransRe\u2019s operating subsidiaries from the Rating Agencies fall below A-, a significant portion of TransRe\u2019s operating subsidiaries\u2019 contracts that contain rating agency triggers would allow customers to elect to take a number of actions such as terminating the contracts on a run-off or cut-off basis, requiring TransRe\u2019s operating subsidiaries to post collateral for all or a portion of the obligations or requiring commutation under the contracts. Some of these contracts, however, contain dual triggers, such as requiring both a ratings downgrade below A- and a significant decline in the statutory surplus of TransRe\u2019s operating subsidiaries before such cancellation or collateralization rights would be exercisable. Contracts may contain one or both of the aforementioned contractual provisions, or certain other collateralization or cancellation triggers. Whether a ceding company would exercise any of these cancellation rights would depend on, among other factors, the reason and extent of such downgrade or surplus reduction, the prevailing market conditions and the pricing and availability of replacement reinsurance coverage. We cannot predict the extent to which these contractual rights would be exercised, if at all, or what effect such exercises would have on our financial condition or future operations, but such effect potentially could be materially adverse to us.\nTransRe may also enter into agreements with ceding companies that require it to provide collateral for its obligations, including where TransRe\u2019s obligations to these ceding companies exceed negotiated thresholds. These thresholds may vary depending on the ratings of TransRe\u2019s operating subsidiaries, and a ratings downgrade or a failure to achieve a certain rating may increase the amount of collateral TransRe is required to provide. An increase in the amount of collateral TransRe is obligated to\nprovide to secure its obligations may have an adverse impact on, among other things, TransRe\u2019s ability to write additional reinsurance.\nA limited number of brokers account for a large portion of TransRe\u2019s premiums; the loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by them may have an adverse effect on us. The great majority of TransRe\u2019s premiums are written through brokers. Several large international brokers dominate the reinsurance brokerage industry, and TransRe derives a significant portion of its premiums from these brokers. Further, TransRe may become increasingly reliant on these brokers due to continued consolidation in the broker sector. The loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by these brokers could have a material adverse effect on us.\nDifficult and volatile conditions in the global capital and credit markets and in the overall economy could materially and adversely affect the results of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries. Disruption and volatility in the global capital and credit markets and in the overall economy affects our business in a number of ways, including the following:\n\u2022\ndisruption in the capital and credit markets may increase claims activity in our reinsurance business, such as directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability, errors and omissions liability and trade credit lines;\n\u2022\nvolatility in the capital and credit markets makes it more difficult to access those markets, if necessary, to maintain or improve financial strength and credit ratings of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries or to generate liquidity;\n\u2022\ndisruption in the overall economy may reduce demand for reinsurance and insurance products; and\n\u2022\nincreases in inflation could result in higher losses on reinsurance contracts, particularly in longer-tailed lines of business, increased operating costs and a decrease in the fair value of our investment portfolio.\nIt is difficult to predict when and how long these types of conditions may exist and how our markets, business and investments will be adversely affected. Accordingly, these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\nThe businesses of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are heavily regulated, and changes in regulation may limit their ability to pay dividends, reduce their profitability and limit their growth. Our reinsurance and insurance operating subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business, both in the U.S. and other countries. This regulation is generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders and not necessarily the interests of insurers, their stockholders or other investors. The regulation relates to authorization for lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, investment limitations, underwriting limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, premium rates and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of a reinsurance or insurance company\u2019s business. Moreover, insurance laws and regulations, among other things: establish solvency requirements, including minimum reserves and capital and surplus requirements; limit the amount of dividends, tax distributions, intercompany loans and other payments our insurance subsidiaries can make without prior regulatory approval; and impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments we may hold. The application of these laws could affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends, interest and other payments on securities, among other things.\nVirtually all states in which our insurance operating subsidiary companies conduct their business require them, together with other insurers licensed to do business in that state, to bear a portion of the loss suffered by some insureds as the result of impaired or insolvent insurance companies. In addition, in various states, our insurance operating subsidiary companies must participate in mandatory arrangements to provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or other entities that otherwise are unable to purchase that coverage from private insurers. A few states require our insurance operating subsidiary companies to purchase reinsurance from a mandatory reinsurance fund. Such reinsurance funds can create a credit risk for insurers if not adequately funded by the state and, in some cases, the existence of a reinsurance fund could affect the prices charged for the policies issued by our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries. The effect of these and similar arrangements could reduce the profitability of our insurance operating subsidiaries in any given period or limit their ability to grow their business.\nIn recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased scrutiny, and some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. Further, the NAIC and state insurance regulators are continually reexamining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on modifications to statutory accounting principles, credit for reinsurance laws, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations. On the federal level, the Dodd-Frank Act, signed into law on July 2010, mandated significant changes to the regulation of U.S. insurance effective as of July 21, 2011. We cannot predict the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act or the impact such regulations will have on our business. In addition, we cannot predict the impact on our business, if any, of any potential \u201croll back\u201d or dismantling of the Dodd-Frank Act. These regulations, and any proposed or future state or federal legislation or NAIC initiatives, if adopted, may be more restrictive on the ability of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries to conduct business than current regulatory requirements or may result in higher costs. Information regarding the impact of regulation and current regulatory changes on our reinsurance and insurance operating subsidiaries can be found on pages 48 through 54 of this Form 10-K.\nTransRe\u2019s offices that operate in jurisdictions outside the U.S. are subject to certain limitations and risks that are unique to foreign operations. TransRe\u2019s international operations are also regulated in various jurisdictions with respect to licensing requirements, solvency, currency, amount and type of security deposits, amount and type of reserves, amount and type of local investments and other matters. International operations and assets held abroad are subject to significant legal, market, operational, compliance and regulatory risks, including risks related to:\n\u2022\neconomic, political and other developments in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nchanges in foreign or U.S. laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nnationalization and changes in regulatory policy;\n\u2022\nunexpected financial restrictions that foreign governments may impose;\n\u2022\nthe potential costs and difficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations; and\n\u2022\nthe consequences of international hostilities and unrest.\nThe risks of such occurrences and their overall effect upon us vary from country to country and cannot be predicted. In addition, our results of operations and net unrealized currency translation gain or loss (a component of accumulated other comprehensive income) are subject to volatility as the value of the foreign currencies fluctuate relative to the U.S. dollar. Further, regulations governing technical reserves and remittance balances in some countries may hinder remittance of profits and repatriation of assets.\nThe international and U.S. laws and regulations that are applicable to TransRe\u2019s operations are complex and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance, limit or restrict TransRe\u2019s reinsurance business or subject TransRe to regulatory actions or proceedings in the future. Although TransRe attempts to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and seeks licenses to undertake various activities where appropriate, there can be no assurance that TransRe is, or will be, in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, or interpretations of these laws and regulations, at all times. In addition, it is TransRe\u2019s policy to continually monitor compliance with, and voluntarily report to appropriate regulatory authorities any potential violations of, all applicable laws and regulations where it is deemed appropriate, including anti-corruption and trade sanction laws, and any failure to comply with any such laws and regulations may subject TransRe to investigations, sanctions or other remedies, including fines, injunctions, increased scrutiny or oversight by regulatory authorities. The cost of compliance or the consequences of non-compliance, including reputational damage, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\nOn January 16, 2016, following implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or the \u201cJCPOA,\u201d certain trade sanctions laws of the EU and the United Nations restricting dealings with Iran and Iranian entities were substantially eased, and the U.S. also provided relief for certain restrictions on individuals and entities outside of the U.S. On Implementation Day, the U.S. also authorized, under General License H, foreign companies owned or controlled by U.S. persons, such as TRL and TRZ, to engage in certain transactions involving Iran and Iranian entities. Pursuant to General License H and a specific license issued to TransRe, TRL and TRZ provided reinsurance coverage to non-Iranian cedants that had exposure to de minimis Iran-related risks that were permissible under General License H. On May 8, 2018, the U.S. announced it would cease participation in the JCPOA and reinstated the sanctions that were in effect prior to U.S. participation. Foreign companies owned or controlled by U.S. persons were allowed 180 days to withdraw from any business dealings that were entered into under General License H and any additional authoriziations, including general or specific licenses, granted by OFAC. Consequently, TRL and TRZ timely discontinued such coverage. As the failure to comply with trade sanctions prohibitions could subject TransRe to investigations, significant fines and other penalties, TransRe has implemented processes and procedures to comply with the reinstated trade sanctions laws of the U.S. Additionally, as the decision to withdraw from the JCPOA was unilateral, TransRe may be subject to penalties and fines in jurisdictions, such as the EU, that disallow compliance with such unilateral trade sanctions by TransRe\u2019s operations within those jurisdictions. The cost of compliance or the consequences of non-compliance with the trade sanctions laws of the U.S. and other jurisdictions, including reputational damage, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\nPrior to January 13, 2017, the U.S. maintained comprehensive sanctions against Sudan. On January 13, 2017, OFAC issued a general license authorizing all transactions previously prohibited by the Sudan Sanctions Regulations, which sanctions were then revoked on October 12, 2017. As a result, beginning January 13, 2017, sanctions exclusions clauses, which TransRe utilizes in its reinsurance contracts to exclude coverage of prohibited risks, no longer excluded coverage by TransRe of Sudanese risks authorized under such license, and TransRe was obliged under the language of its reinsurance contracts to provide coverage and pay valid claims occurring on or after that date on any covered Sudanese risks legally permissible. TransRe continues to be exposed to Sudanese risks on treaties underwritten after January 13, 2017. Despite the lifting of U.S. sanctions, Sudan remains on the U.S. list of State Sponsors of Terrorism. TransRe has no direct business with Sudanese cedants or any contracts with Sudanese entities. TransRe has determined that a small number of Sudanese-related risks are underwritten by non-Sudanese cedants for which TransRe provides coverage under reinsurance treaties and which are not, as a result of the lifting of U.S. sanctions, excluded under such treaties. The revenue associated with such reinsurance covering this small number of Sudanese-related risks is immaterial to both TransRe and Alleghany.\nWith regards to TransRe\u2019s operations within the EU, TRC operates within the EU as a Third Country Reinsurer under Solvency II through a series of foreign branches and on a cross-border basis. Each branch of TRC in the EU that is required to be authorized is separately authorized by the relevant regulator in the Member State in which it is established. Currently, TRC continues to conduct business within the EU through its foreign branches with no significant impact on its operations. However, TransRe could be materially and adversely affected by rules adopted by a Member State related to Third Country Reinsurers. For example, TRC may be required to post additional collateral in EU countries or may need to consider further restructuring its business in order to comply with the rules adopted in EU countries related to Third Country Reinsurers.\nSolvency II, which is a fundamental revision to the European regulatory regime that seeks to enhance transparency and risk management and encourages a proactive approach to company solvency, came into effect on January 1, 2016. It is built on a risk-based approach to setting capital requirements for reinsurers and insurers. Solvency II may affect the way in which TransRe\u2019s international group, including TRL and TRC\u2019s branches in the EU operate and may have a negative impact on our results. Solvency II may reduce TRL\u2019s and/or TRC\u2019s EU branches\u2019 regulatory solvency position, for example, by increased capital requirements or a reduction in eligible funds. Solvency II could also materially impact the group, since Solvency II affects the calculation of the solvency of international groups which, like TransRe, conduct reinsurance and insurance operations both inside and outside of the EU. The changes also require an accelerated quarterly close process across the group to allow TRL and TRC\u2019s EU branches to meet the regulatory disclosure timetable under Solvency II. Other risks include more complex and intensive regulatory reporting burdens, regulatory requirements that conflict with requirements in other jurisdictions, and shortages of skilled staff in critical areas such as the actuarial function, all of which may have a negative impact on the results of TRL, the branches of TRC and the TransRe group. In addition, we could be required to undertake a significant amount of additional work to comply with the Solvency II regime, which in turn may divert finite resources from other business related tasks.\nAlthough Solvency II is now in force, uncertainty remains as to how the Solvency II regime will be enforced or amended and the effectiveness of the coordination and cooperation of information sharing among supervisory bodies and regulators or the effect, if any, these developments may have on the TransRe group\u2019s operations and financial condition. This uncertainty has increased as a result of the Brexit referendum which will lead to the U.K. leaving the EU at a yet to be determined date. Following Brexit, the U.K. would be free to determine its own regulatory regime. We cannot currently predict whether the U.K.\u2019s regulatory regime will be deemed equivalent to Solvency II or the impact on TRL and TRC if the future U.K. regulatory regime is not found to be equivalent to Solvency II.\nThe uncertainty has also increased as a result of the announcement in January 2017 by the Treasury Department and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative that the covered agreement with the EU has been successfully negotiated. For example, the covered agreement provides for the elimination of local presence and reinsurance collateral requirements for EU-domiciled reinsurers operating in the U.S. and for U.S.-domiciled reinsurers operating in the EU. Further, the covered agreement includes certain provisions limiting the ability of EU jurisdictions to impose group supervision (including governance, solvency and capital, and reporting) requirements on U.S. insurance and reinsurance groups. While this development would appear to be beneficial to TransRe, we cannot currently predict whether the covered agreement between the U.S. and the EU will be successfully adopted, nor, if adopted, what its application to the U.K. will be post-Brexit. Our Solvency II implementation approach is based on our current understanding of the Solvency II requirements and any material changes thereto could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe 2016 Brexit vote whereby the U.K. electorate voted in favor of the U.K.\u2019s exit from the EU could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Brexit vote means that insurance and reinsurance carriers operating in the U.K. are experiencing a period of regulatory uncertainty as the U.K. and the EU undertake the challenge of redefining the U.K.\u2019s economic and political relationships with the EU. The U.K. will remain a member state of the EU until it negotiates and reaches an agreement in relation to the withdrawal from the EU or, if earlier, upon the expiration of a two year period following the Article 50 notification (i.e. on March 29, 2019). In November 2018, the U.K. and the EU announced their agreement on a draft text of a withdrawal agreement, which would include the application of transitional provisions under which EU law would broadly remain in force in the U.K. until the end of December 2020. However, there is uncertainty as to whether the withdrawal agreement, with is subject to approval of the U.K. Parliament, will actually be entered into. In the absence of such an agreement there would be no transitional provisions and a \u201chard Brexit\u201d would occur on March 29, 2019, unless the U.K. government were to revoke its Article 50 notice or if the two year Article 50 period were to be extended. It is possible that the withdrawal process may last significantly longer than the two year period envisaged by the Treaty of the EU. The uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of Brexit, including the commencement of the exit negotiation period, the terms and conditions of such exit, the uncertainty in relation to the legal and regulatory framework that would apply to the U.K. and its relationship with the remaining members of the EU (including in relation to trade and services) during a withdrawal process and after any Brexit is effected, has caused and is likely to cause increased economic volatility and market uncertainty globally, in particular volatility of currency exchange rates, interest rates and credit spreads. It has already led, and may continue to lead, to disruptions for the European and global financial markets, such as the decrease in the value of the British Pound and of market values of listed U.K. companies, in particular from the financial services and insurance sector, and the recent downgrade of the credit ratings for the U.K. by S&P, Moody\u2019s and Fitch (each with a negative outlook).\nThe long-term effect of Brexit on the value of our investment portfolio at this time is uncertain and such volatility and uncertainty will likely continue as negotiations progress to determine the future terms of the U.K.\u2019s relationship with the EU.\nBrexit could lead to potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. We may have to review our underwriting platforms and incur additional regulatory and transactional costs as a result. For example, depending on the outcome of the negotiations referred to above, TRL could lose its EEA financial services passport which provides it the license to operate across borders within the single EU market without obtaining any required local regulatory approval where insurers and cedants are located. In addition, depending on the terms of Brexit, the U.K.\u2019s regulatory regime in terms of Solvency II regulation and governance could also diverge and no longer be equivalent.\nDepending on the terms of Brexit or if there is a hard Brexit, the U.K. could also lose tariff-free access to the single EU market and to the global trade deals negotiated by the EU on behalf of its Member States. Any consequential decline in trade could affect the attractiveness of the U.K. as a global investment center and, as a result, could have a detrimental impact on U.K. growth. We could be adversely affected by reduced growth and greater volatility in the U.K. economy.\nIn Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, India and the People\u2019s Republic of China, emerging markets where TransRe underwrites business on a cross-border basis, local regulations have recently been adopted that may operate to limit, restrict or increase the costs of TransRe\u2019s access to these markets. If this trend continues to spread to other jurisdictions, TransRe\u2019s ability to operate globally may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe loss of key personnel at our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We rely upon the knowledge and talent of the employees of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries to successfully conduct their business. Changes in local employment legislation, taxation and the approach of regulatory bodies to compensation practice within our operating jurisdictions may impact our ability to recruit and retain senior employees or the cost to us of doing so. A loss of key personnel, especially the loss of underwriters or underwriting teams, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in future periods. Our success has depended, and will continue to depend in substantial part, upon our ability to attract and retain teams of underwriters in various business lines at our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries. The loss of key services of any members of current underwriting teams at our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nErrors and misconduct by our employees, agents, intermediaries or representatives may be difficult to detect and prevent and could expose us to significant legal liability and reputational harm. Our employees and the employees of our subsidiaries could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. It is not always possible to deter or prevent employee error or misconduct, and the controls and procedures that we have in place to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Losses may result from, among other things, illegal acts, unethical behavior, fraud, errors, failure to document transactions properly, failure to obtain proper internal authorization, failure to comply with underwriting or other internal guidelines by our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements or our internal policies. We could be subject to litigation, regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation or financial position if employees were to engage or be accused of engaging in illegal or suspicious activities or failing to comply with internal guidelines and protocols. Misconduct by employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, which impose restrictions and may carry substantial penalties. Violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could adversely affect results of operations or financial condition. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, including the U.K. Bribery Act that took effect in 2011, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. Our policies and controls are designed to ensure compliance with these anti-bribery laws and regulations, which often carry substantial penalties. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures always will protect us from reckless or other inappropriate acts committed by our affiliates, employees, agents or other third parties with whom we do business. In such event, we could be exposed to civil penalties, criminal penalties and other sanctions, including fines or other punitive actions. In addition, such violations could damage our business and/or our reputation. Such criminal or civil sanctions, penalties, other sanctions and damage to our business or reputation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nThere are significant hazards associated with oil exploration and production activities, some of which may not be fully covered by insurance. The business of exploring for, producing, storing and transporting oil is subject to risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, construction risks, industrial accidents, the encountering of unusual or unexpected geological formations, cave-ins, blowouts, fires, explosions, craterings, pipeline ruptures and spills, flooding, earthquakes and other natural disasters. These occurrences could result in personal injury or death, environmental damage, damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or production facilities or other physical assets, monetary losses and possible legal liability. Although we maintain insurance against some of these risks, insurance fully covering many of these risks is not generally available to us or if it is, we may elect not to obtain it due to the high premium costs or commercial impracticality. Any liabilities that we may incur for these risks and hazards could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks related to our use of information technology. We rely on information technology in virtually all aspects of our business. Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries in particular depend on the proper functioning and availability of their information technology platforms, including communications and data processing systems, in operating their businesses. These systems consist of software programs that are integral to the efficient operation of the businesses of our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries, including programs for proprietary pricing and exposure management, processing payments and claims, filing and making changes to records and providing customer support. Our reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries are also required to effect electronic transmissions with third parties including brokers, clients, vendors and others with whom they do business.\nA significant disruption or failure of our information technology systems may have a significant impact on our operations, potentially resulting in service interruptions, security violations, regulatory compliance failures and other operational difficulties. In addition, any attack perpetrated against our information systems including through a system failure, security breach or disruption by malware or other damage, could similarly impact our operations and result in loss or misuse of information, litigation and potential liability. Although we have taken steps intended to mitigate the risks presented by potential cyber incidents, it is not possible to protect against every potential power loss, telecommunications failure, cybersecurity attack or similar event that may arise. Moreover, the safeguards we use are subject to human implementation and maintenance and to other uncertainties. Any of these cyber incidents may result in a violation of applicable laws or regulations (including privacy and other laws), damage our reputation, cause a loss of customers and give rise to monetary fines and other penalties, which could be significant. Such events could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe costs of complying with, or our failure to comply with, U.S. and foreign laws related to privacy, data security and data protection, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our reputation. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. We are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state laws and non-U.S. regulations governing the protection of personal and confidential information of our clients or employees, including the New York Department of Financial Services\u2019 Cybersecurity Regulation, or the \u201cNYDFS Cybersecurity Regulation,\u201d which mandates detailed cybersecurity standards for all institutions, including insurance entities, authorized by the NYDFS to operate in New York. Among the requirements are the maintenance of a cybersecurity program with governance controls, risk-based minimum data security standards for technology systems, cyber breach preparedness and response requirements, including reporting obligations, vendor oversight, training and program record keeping and certification obligations. The NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulation has increased our compliance costs and the consequences of noncompliance could include regulatory enforcement actions and penalties, as well as reputation risk.\nThe NAIC adopted an Insurance Data Security Model Law, which would require licensed insurance entities to comply with detailed information security requirements. The NAIC model law is similar in many respects to the NYDFS Cybersecurity Regulation. It is not yet known whether, and to what extent, states legislatures or insurance regulators where our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries operate will enact the Insurance Data Security Model Law. Such enactments, especially if inconsistent between states or with existing laws and regulations could raise compliance costs or increase the risk of noncompliance, with the attendant risk of being subject to regulatory enforcement actions and penalties, as well as reputational harm. Any such events could potentially have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMore broadly, the General Data Protection Regulation, or the \u201cGDPR,\u201d which regulates data protection for all individuals within the EU, including foreign companies processing data of EU residents, became effective on May 25, 2018 and applies to all of our subsidiaries operating in the EU. The regulation sets out a number of requirements that must be complied with when handling the personal data of such EU based data subjects including: the obligation to appoint data protection officers in certain circumstances; new rights for individuals to be \u201cforgotten\u201d and rights to data portability; the principal of accountability and the obligation to make public notification of significant data breaches. The GDPR also retains and adds to some existing requirements, including restrictions on transfers outside the European Economic Area, or the \u201cEEA\u201d (including Switzerland), and the requirement to include specific data protection provisions in agreements with data processors. The GDPR enhances individuals\u2019 rights, introduces complex and far-reaching company obligations and increases penalties significantly in case of violation. The interpretation and application of data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are developing and are often uncertain and in flux. The introduction of the GDPR, and any resultant changes in EU member states\u2019 national laws and regulations, may increase our compliance obligations and costs, and may necessitate the review and implementation of policies and processes relating to our collection and use of data. It is possible that these laws or cybersecurity regulations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data protection or security practices.\nIf any person, including any of our employees, our subsidiaries\u2019 employees or those with whom we share such information, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to our client or employee data, or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. For example, the GDPR increases sanctions for non-compliance, which could result in a penalty of up to the higher of (a) \u008020 million; and (b) 4 percent of a company\u2019s global annual revenue for the preceding financial year for certain infringements, such as unlawful data transfer outside of the EEA. In addition, a data breach could result in negative publicity which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe impact of changes in current accounting practices and future pronouncements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which is periodically revised by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the \u201cFASB,\u201d and they are subject to the accounting-related rules and interpretations of the SEC. We are required to adopt new and revised accounting standards implemented by the FASB. Unanticipated developments in accounting practices may require us to incur considerable additional time and expenses to comply with such developments, particularly if we are required to prepare information relating to prior periods for comparative purposes or to apply the new requirements retroactively. For a description of changes in accounting standards that are currently pending and, if known, our estimates of their expected impact, see Note 1(r) to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Form 10-K.\nRisk Factors Related to our Investments and Assets\nThe valuation of our investments includes methodologies, estimates and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations or judgments; a change in interpretations or judgments could result in changes to investment valuations that may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. The vast majority of our investments are measured at fair value using methodologies, estimates and assumptions which are subject to differing interpretations or judgments. Financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets generally have more price observability and less judgment is used in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments traded in other-than-active markets or that do not have quoted prices have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models or other pricing techniques that require more judgment. Investments recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet are classified in a hierarchy for disclosure purposes consisting of three \u201clevels\u201d based on the observability of inputs available in the market used to measure the fair values.\nSecurities that are less liquid are more difficult to value and trade. During periods of market disruption, including periods of significantly rising or high interest rates, rapidly widening credit spreads or illiquidity, it may be difficult to value certain of the securities in our investment portfolio if trading becomes less frequent or market data becomes less observable. Certain asset classes in active markets with significant observable data may become illiquid due to changes in the financial environment. In such cases, valuing these securities may require more subjectivity and judgment. In addition, prices provided by third-party pricing services and broker quotes can vary widely even for the same security.\nAs such, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation as well as valuation methods which are more sophisticated, thereby resulting in values which may be greater or less than the value at which the investments may be ultimately sold. Further, rapidly changing or strained credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the value of securities as reported within our consolidated financial statements and the period-to-period changes in value could vary significantly. Decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur investments in debt and equity securities are subject to market fluctuations. As of December 31, 2018, our investments in debt securities were approximately $11.8 billion, or approximately 67 percent of our total investment portfolio, and our investments in equity securities had a fair value of approximately $3.6 billion, which represented approximately 20 percent of our investment portfolio. The fair value of these assets and the investment income from these assets fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions.\nWith respect to our investments in debt securities, a rise in interest rates would decrease unrealized gains and/or increase unrealized losses on our debt securities portfolio and potentially produce a net unrealized loss position, offset by our ability to earn higher rates of return on reinvested funds. Conversely, a decline in interest rates would increase unrealized gains and/or decrease unrealized losses on our debt securities portfolio, offset by lower rates of return on reinvested funds. Based upon the composition and duration of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2018, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $490.7 million decrease in the fair value of our debt securities portfolio. In addition, some debt securities, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, carry prepayment risk, the risk that principal will be returned more rapidly or slowly than expected, as a result of interest rate fluctuations.\nWith respect to our investments in equity securities, we consider all of our equity securities to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net earnings.\nDefaults, downgrades or other events impairing the value of our debt securities portfolio may reduce our earnings. We are subject to the risk that the issuers of debt securities we own may default on principal and interest payments they owe us. The occurrence of a major economic downturn, acts of corporate malfeasance, widening risk spreads or other events that adversely affect the issuers of these debt securities could cause the value of our debt securities portfolio and our net earnings to decline and the default rate of the debt securities in our investment portfolio to increase. In addition, with economic uncertainty, the credit quality of issuers could be adversely affected and a ratings downgrade of the issuers of the debt securities we own could also cause the value of our debt securities portfolio and our net earnings to decrease. Any event reducing the value of these securities other than on a temporary basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We continually monitor the difference between cost and the estimated fair value of our investments in debt securities. If a decline in the\nvalue of a particular debt security is deemed to be temporary, we record the decline as an unrealized loss in stockholders\u2019 equity. If the decline is deemed to be other than temporary, we write it down to the carrying value of the investment and record an other than temporary impairment loss in our statement of earnings, which may be material to our operating results.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates could impact the value of our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. A principal exposure to foreign currency risk is our obligation to settle claims denominated in foreign currencies in the subject foreign currencies. The possibility exists that we may incur foreign currency exchange gains or losses when we ultimately settle these claims. To mitigate this risk, we maintain investments denominated in certain foreign currencies in which the claims payments will be made and we have recently initiated a hedging program that is designed to mitigate this risk for a portion of our exposure to certain currencies. To the extent we do not seek to hedge our foreign currency risk or our hedges prove ineffective, the resulting impact of a movement in foreign currency exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. For example, stockholders\u2019 equity attributable to Alleghany stockholders was decreased by $21.9 million during 2018 from the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nIf any of our businesses do not perform well, we may be required to recognize an impairment of our assets, including goodwill or other intangible assets or to establish a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. Goodwill represents the excess of the amount we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets as of the date of acquisition. We test goodwill at least annually for impairment. Impairment testing is performed based upon estimates of the fair value of the operating subsidiary to which the goodwill relates. The fair value of the operating subsidiary is impacted by the performance of the business. The performance of our businesses may be adversely impacted by prolonged market declines. If we determine the goodwill has been impaired, we must write down the goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net earnings. Such write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. A decrease in the expected future earnings of an operating subsidiary could lead to an impairment of some or all of the goodwill or other long-lived intangible assets associated with such operating subsidiaries in future periods.\nDeferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if they are recoverable. Factors in management\u2019s determination include the performance of the business including the ability to generate capital gains. If it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax asset will not be realized based on available information then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net earnings. Net earnings charges and reduced value of our net deferred tax assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\nDeterioration of financial market conditions could result in the impairment of long-lived intangible assets and the establishment of a valuation allowance on our deferred income tax assets.\nOil and gas prices are volatile and a prolonged reduction in these prices could adversely affect the value of our investments in energy-related businesses. As of December 31, 2018, we had holdings in energy-related businesses of $385.2 million, comprised of $288.9 million of debt securities, $8.3 million of equity securities and $88.0 million of our equity attributable to SORC. The results and prospects of these energy-related businesses tend to depend highly upon the prices of oil and gas. Historically, the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. A prolonged reduction in the prices of oil and gas may adversely affect the results and prospects of, and the potentially the value of our investments in, these energy-related businesses.\nRisks Related to our Senior Notes and the Credit Agreement\nOur failure to comply with restrictive covenants contained in the indentures governing the Senior Notes (as defined on page 110 of this Form 10-K) or any other indebtedness, including indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and any future indebtedness, could trigger prepayment obligations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The indentures governing the Senior Notes contain covenants that impose restrictions on Alleghany and TransRe with respect to, among other things, the incurrence of liens on the capital stock of certain of our subsidiaries. In addition, the indentures governing the Senior Notes contain certain other covenants, including covenants to timely pay principal and interest, and the Credit Agreement (as defined on page 108 of this Form 10-K) also requires us to comply with certain covenants. Our failure to comply with such covenants could result in an event of default under the indentures, under the Credit Agreement or under any other debt agreement we may enter into in the future, which could, if not cured or waived, result in us being required to repay the Senior Notes, the indebtedness under the Credit Agreement or any other future indebtedness. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nTo service our debt, we will require a significant amount of cash, which may not be available to us. Our ability to make payments on, or repay or refinance, our debt, including the Senior Notes, will depend largely upon the future performance and use of our investment portfolio and our future operating performance, including the operating performance of our subsidiaries. Our future performance, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future will depend on the satisfaction of the\ncovenants in the indentures governing the Senior Notes, in the Credit Agreement and in other debt agreements we may enter into in the future. Under the Credit Agreement, we also need to maintain certain financial ratios. We cannot assure you that our business, including the operating performance of our subsidiaries, will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under the Credit Agreement or from other sources in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt, including the Senior Notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs.", "PERMNO": 71271, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "Y"}
