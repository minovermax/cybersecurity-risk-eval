{"cik": "1091596", "company": "Nuo Therapeutics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-04-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company faces many risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks the Company faces. Additional risks not yet known or currently believed to be immaterial may also impair our business. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our common stock could continue to decline. You should consider the following risks, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision with respect to our securities.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Financial Position, Business and Industry\nWe Have Depleted our Cash Resources and Our Ability to Continue to Operate is in Immediate Jeopardy\nWe have depleted our cash resources and our ability to continue to operate is in immediate jeopardy. At December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $0.6 million, total current assets of approximately $0.9 million and total current liabilities of approximately $1.1 million. At March 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $0.2 million. As of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are delinquent on rent payments with respect to both leased facilities in Gaithersburg, MD and face eviction.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company was able to monetize several of its remaining assets, including through agreements with Rohto, as described in \"Business - Aurix Licensing and Collaboration Agreement,\" and with STEMCELL, as described in \"Business - Patents, Licenses, and Property Rights.\" While the sale of those assets provided critical inflow of funds to alleviate the Company's ongoing liquidity concerns, the Company now has no further assets left to monetize and is facing immediate cessation of operations and liquidation.\nOur continuing losses and depleted cash raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and we need to raise substantial additional funds immediately in order to continue to conduct our business. Our cost reduction measures to date have included the reduction of our full-time employees from 15 at December 31, 2017 to 7 as of December 31, 2018. If we are unable within the next 30 days to raise substantial additional funds, we will likely be forced to cease operations and liquidate our assets. If we were required to liquidate today, the holders of our common stock would not receive any consideration for their common stock as a result of the outstanding convertible notes and the liquidation preference of the holder of our Series A Preferred Stock. See \u201cThe Rights of the Holders of our Common Stock and the Value of our Common Stock are Severely Limited by the Convertible Notes and the Liquidation Preference and Other Terms of our Series A Preferred Stock.\u201d\nOur Revenue Base Is Limited to a Single Product Seeking Market Adoption, We Need Substantial Additional Financing and Our Ability to Effect Such Financing Successfully Is Very Limited\nOur current revenue base is limited to our Aurix product, and our Aurix revenue has been minimal. Our ongoing product revenues have continued to decline significantly since 2016.\nWe have a history of losses and are not currently profitable. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred a net loss from operations of approximately $1.5 million. Even if we succeed in raising substantial additional funds immediately to liquidation, we expect to incur losses and negative operating cash flows in the foreseeable future. We may never generate sufficient revenues to achieve and maintain profitability.\nHistorically, we have financed our operations through a combination of the sale of debt, equity and equity-linked securities, licensing, royalty, and product revenues. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenues to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we need to finance future cash needs. It is substantially uncertain whether we will be able to obtain such financing on satisfactory terms or at all.\nEven if we succeed in raising substantial additional funds immediately to avoid liquidation, if we are unable to secure sufficient capital to fund our operating activities beyond the immediate future or we are unable to increase revenues significantly over that time period, we may be forced to delay further the completion of, or significantly reduce the scope of, our current business plan, delay the pursuit of commercial insurance reimbursement for our wound treatment technologies, and postpone the hiring of new personnel. If we are unable to secure sufficient capital to fund our operating activities and are unable to increase revenues significantly, we will likely be required to cease operations and liquidate our assets.\nOn September 17, 2018, we issued and sold to Auctus Fund, LLC (\u201cAuctus\u201d) and EMA Financial, LLC (\u201cEMA\u201d and, collectively with Auctus, the \u201cInvestors\u201d) 12% convertible promissory notes, each in the principal amount of $175,000, for an aggregate purchase price of $315,800 (reflecting a combined $34,200 in original issue discount and transaction fees)(the \u201c2018 Convertible Notes\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the 2018 Convertible Notes, we are restricted in our ability to declare or pay dividends, to incur other indebtedness and to sell assets, among other things\nThe Certificate of Designations for our Series A Preferred Stock limits the Company\u2019s ability to (i) issue securities that are senior or pari passu with the Series A Preferred Stock, (ii) incur debt (other than for working capital purposes not in excess of $3.0 million) and (iii) issue securities that are junior to the Series A Preferred Stock and that provide certain consent rights to the holders of such junior securities in connection with a liquidation or contain certain liquidation preferences, in each case without the consent of holders representing at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares Series A Preferred Stock.\nAny equity financings, to the extent permitted under the terms of the 2018 Convertible Notes and the Certificate of Designations for our Series A Preferred Stock, may cause further substantial dilution to our stockholders and could involve the issuance of securities with rights senior to the common stock. Any allowed debt financings (which are restricted under the terms of the 2018 Convertible Notes and the Certificate of Designations for our Series A Preferred Stock) may require us to comply with onerous financial covenants and restrict our business operations. The 2018 Convertible Notes, for example, contain severely restrictive covenants and default provisions. Our ability to complete additional financings is dependent on, among other things, the state of the capital markets at the time of any proposed equity or debt offering, state of the credit markets at the time of any proposed loan financing, market reception of the Company and perceived likelihood of success of our business model, and on the relevant transaction terms, among other things. We may not be able to obtain additional capital as required to finance our efforts, through equity or debt financings, or any combination thereof, on satisfactory terms or at all. Additionally, any such financing, if at all obtained, may not be adequate to meet our capital needs and to support our operations.\nIf adequate capital cannot be obtained on a timely basis and on satisfactory terms, it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to implement our business plan, and our revenues and operations and the value of our common stock would be materially negatively impacted and we may be forced to curtail or cease our operations.\nOur Discussions with CAG to Date Raise Substantial Doubt that CAG Will Approve Our Request to Re-Open the National Coverage Determination\nOur immediate focus is on successfully concluding discussions with the Coverage and Analysis Group (CAG) of CMS concerning our request to reopen the National Coverage Determination (NCD) for diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) based on the evidence collected under CED to date for this wound etiology. On October 22, 2018, Company\u2019s management met with representatives of CMS\u2019 Coverage and Analysis Group (CAG) to discuss the status of the three study protocols (for diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers and pressure ulcers) totaling 2,200 patients under the Company\u2019s CED program. The Company presented to CAG its view that completion of the studies to full enrollment was no longer considered practical and that completion of the CED studies as presently structured was untenable. The Company discussed with CAG a variety of difficulties and limitations that have arisen during the conduct of the CED program that have contributed to slow enrollment, closure of study sites, and concerns about overall data integrity. See \u201cBusiness - Our Strategy\u201d for further information on our discussions with CAG.\nOur discussions with CAG to date raise substantial doubt that CAG will approve our request to re-open the NCD, or at least do so in a timeframe necessary for us to avoid liquidation in the immediate future.\nWe believe that the expansion of reimbursement to patients outside of CED can be achieved only after a successful NCD re-determination. Even if CAG agrees to re-open the NCD, there are no assurances that broad access and reimbursement can be achieved.\nThe Lack of an Economically Appropriate Physician Fee for Aurix Treatments Continues to Present an Obstacle to Adequate Levels of Patient Enrollment in the CED Protocols\nBeginning in May 2016, the Company initiated conversations with CMS\u2019 Division of Practitioner Services regarding the fee paid (if any) by Medicare to the treating physician for services rendered during an Aurix treatment application under CED. Unlike the facility fee reimbursed by Medicare for the Aurix product itself, which is a payment that is mandated per the CED National Coverage Determination, or NCD, any physician fee was to be established by the regional Medicare Administrative Contractors, or MACs, at their discretion. Given the Company's assessment of the MAC\u2019s apparent lack of familiarity with CED generally as a CMS national initiative and Aurix as a product with limited usage and history in Medicare\u2019s databases, establishment of a consistent physician fee reflective of the underlying work performed by a treating physician when utilizing Aurix therapy has been difficult.\nThe Company\u2019s discussions with CMS have emphasized the potential benefit to the Aurix CED program in establishing a standard national payment rate applied consistently to all physicians treating patients in the CED protocols that provides an adequate payment for the clinical assessment, treatment, time and other Relative Value Unit cost components to physicians utilizing Aurix. The Company can provide no assurances that such a national payment rate would become effective (i) at all, or (ii) at a level high enough to provide an adequate payment for physicians, or (iii) on a timely basis so as to provide a meaningful opportunity to the Company in light of its liquidity constraints or (iii) that it would in fact have a sufficiently positive impact on patient enrollment in the CED studies.\nThe Success of Aurix Is Dependent on Acceptance by the Medical Community, Including Satisfactory Completion of the CED Programs\nThe commercial success of our product will depend upon the medical community and patients accepting the therapies as safe and effective. It will also depend on our success with implementing the CED program. Implementation of CED programs in general has been slow. The cost and complexity required to implement CED programs, including with respect to documentation requirements, as well as the unfamiliarity of many health care providers with CED, may significantly affect the willingness of health care providers to adopt or use Aurix. See also the risk factors titled \u201cThe Lack of an Economically Appropriate Physician Fee for Aurix Treatments May Continue to Present an Obstacle to Adequate Levels of Patient Enrollment in the CED Protocols\u201d and \u201cThe 20% Co-Payment Required under Medicare Rules Continues to Present an Obstacle to Adequate Levels of Patient Enrollment in the CED Protocols\u201d. Any of this in turn could prevent the Company from increasing its revenues.\nBased on guidance from the CMS Coverage and Analysis Group, or CAG, a CED cycle is considered complete when CMS completes a reconsideration of the existing National Coverage Determination and removes the requirement for study participation as a condition of coverage. Upon successful completion of the CED program, if supported by the health outcomes data generated, CMS may expand Medicare reimbursement for treatment of chronic non-healing wounds with Aurix as an autologous platelet-rich plasma product. By contrast, if the data generated show no substantial improvement in health outcomes for patients using Aurix therapy, CMS may determine not to provide unrestricted coverage for the Aurix System.\nFurthermore, the willingness of the medical community to accept or evaluate our products and processes may be impacted by our ability to cause such information to be included in peer-reviewed literature. We may not have the resources necessary to cause such information to be included in peer-reviewed literature. If the medical community and patients do not ultimately accept the therapies as safe and effective, or we are unable to raise awareness of our products and processes, our ability to sell the products may be materially and adversely affected, and the results of our operations may be adversely affected.\nWe Have a History of Losses and Expect to Incur Losses for the Foreseeable Future\nWe have a history of losses, are not currently profitable, and expect to incur losses and negative operating cash flows in the future. Even if we succeed in raising substantial additional funds to avoid liquidation, we may never generate sufficient revenues to achieve and maintain profitability and will continue to incur expenses at current or increased levels as we seek to expand our operations, pursue development of our technologies, work to increase our sales, implement internal systems and infrastructure, and hire additional personnel. These ongoing financial losses may adversely affect our stock price.\nWe Have a Short Operating History and Limited Operating Experience\nWe have only in the past few years been implementing our commercialization strategy for Aurix. Thus, we have a very limited operating history. Continued operating losses, together with the risks associated with our ability to gain new customers for Aurix, may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. We may also be forced to respond to unforeseen difficulties, such as decreased demand for our products and services, downward pricing trends, regulatory requirements and unanticipated market pressures.\nThe Commercialization of Our Aurix System Will Depend on Obtaining Reimbursement from Third-Party Payors\nIn the U.S., the market for any pharmaceutical or biologic product is affected by the availability of reimbursement from third party payors, such as government health administration authorities, private health insurers, health maintenance organizations and pharmacy benefit management companies. If we cannot demonstrate favorable outcomes or a cost-benefit relationship, we may have difficulty obtaining adequate coverage or reimbursement for our products from these payors. Third-party payors may also deny coverage for any of our products if they determine that the product is experimental, unnecessary or inappropriate. Coverage and reimbursement are often determining factors in predicting a product\u2019s success, with some physicians and patients strongly favoring only those products for which they will be reimbursed.\nThe Aurix System is marketed to healthcare providers. Some of these providers, in turn, seek reimbursement from third-party payors such as Medicare, Medicaid, and other private insurers. We may not be successful with our reimbursement strategy, including, without limitation, obtaining additional necessary CMS or other regulatory approvals. For example, CMS may determine that the evidence collected under CED is not sufficient to provide unrestricted Medicare coverage for the Aurix System and autologous Platelet Rich Plasma, or PRP, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If it is determined that a new randomized, controlled trial is necessary, it could cause us to incur significant incremental costs and take multiple years to complete. We would almost certainly need to obtain additional, outside financing to fund such a trial. In any case, we may never be successful in securing unrestricted Medicare coverage for our products. Failure to secure final long term Medicare coverage could negatively affect reimbursement by commercial insurance providers as they often use the existence of Medicare coverage as a significant determinant in their commercial coverage decisions.\nA 2012 NCD from CMS reversed an existing twenty year non-coverage decision for autologous blood derived products used in wound care; this NCD allows for Medicare coverage under the CED program. CMS previously advised us that payment levels for reimbursement claims with respect to Aurix would be reviewed annually and subject to change. Any decision by CMS to decrease payment rates for reimbursement claims will negatively impact the Company's economic value proposition for Aurix in the market for advanced wound care therapies, and could have material adverse effects on the Company\u2019s financial position and results of operations. For example, CMS could decide to place Aurix at a different payment classification level (it is currently placed at Ambulatory Payment Classification, or APC, 5054 (Level 4 Skin Procedures)), could decide that the geometric mean cost of the services underlying Aurix is no longer comparable to the geometric mean cost of APC 5054, or could otherwise determine that the national average reimbursement rate for Aurix treatments should be lower than the current $1,568 per treatment. The national average reimbursement rate for calendar years 2016 -2018 is significantly higher than it was in calendar years 2015 or 2014 ($430 and $411, respectively). In addition, as described in the risk factor titled \u201cThe Lack of an Economically Appropriate Physician Fee for Aurix Treatments May Continue to Present an Obstacle to Adequate Levels of Patient Enrollment in the CED Protocols\u201d, the 2012 NCD does not apply to physician fees, and as described in the risk factor titled \"The 20% Co-Payment Required under Medicare Rules Continues to Present an Obstacle to Adequate Levels of Patient Enrollment in the CED Protocols\", the 2012 NCD does not apply to the 20% co-payment required under Medicare rules.\nShould we seek to expand our commercialization internationally, we would be subject to international regulations, where the pricing of prescription pharmaceutical products and services and the level of government reimbursement may be subject to governmental control. In some countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take six to twelve months or longer after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct one or more clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. Conducting one or more of these clinical trials would be expensive and result in delays in commercialization of our products.\nManaging and reducing healthcare costs has become a major priority of federal and state governments in the U.S. As a result of healthcare reform efforts, we might become subject to future regulations or other cost-control initiatives that materially restrict the price we can receive for our products. Third-party payors may also limit access and reimbursement for newly approved healthcare products generally or limit the indications for which they will reimburse providers or suppliers who use any products that we may develop. Cost control initiatives could decrease the price for products that we may develop, which would result in lower product revenues to us.\nOur Recent Reduction in Staff May Affect our Ability to Conduct our Operations and Other Functions Effectively\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled management, scientific and sales personnel. As part of our cost containment efforts, we have recently reduced staff significantly, from 15 full-time employees at December 31, 2017 to 7 full-time employees as of December 31, 2018.\nOur ability to maintain and provide services to our customers and our ability to provide the necessary support as part of any collaborations depends upon our ability to hire and retain business development and scientific and technical personnel with the skills necessary to keep pace with continuing changes in regenerative biological therapy technologies. Our current liquidity situation makes it unlikely that we will be able to hire additional personnel in the immediate future. Even assuming that we can resolve our immediate liquidity concerns, competition for such personnel is intense; we compete with pharmaceutical, biotechnology and healthcare companies with greater access to resources. Our inability to hire qualified personnel may lead to higher recruiting, relocation and compensation costs for such personnel. These increased costs may make hiring new key personnel impractical.\nIn addition, our controller has recently departed the Company, and our reporting obligations as a public company, as well as our need to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the rules and regulations of the SEC, will continue to place significant demands on us. If we are unable to replace our controller and/or add financial and accounting staff in order to fulfill our reporting responsibilities, we may be unable to meet those responsibilities.\nThe 20% Co-Payment Required under Medicare Rules May Continue to Present an Obstacle to Adequate Levels of Patient Enrollment in the CED Protocols\nUnder standard Medicare payment rules, Medicare beneficiaries are responsible for a 20% Part B co-payment with respect to the cost of their Aurix treatment. Providers generally collect this 20% co-payment from the patient or their secondary insurer and are reluctant to reduce or waive this co-payment due to financial concerns and because waivers of co-payments that are not properly substantiated may violate federal laws, including the federal anti-kickback statute, and result in penalties for improper beneficiary inducements. However, without such waivers, patients who are not otherwise insured and/or who are financially ill-equipped to make the co-payment are often unlikely to participate in the Aurix CED program. Based on data collected thus far under the Company's CED program, patient enrollment in CED protocols in certain Restorix hospital outpatient wound care center sites continues to be adversely impacted by this situation. As a result, the Company, in conjunction with a healthcare facility participating in the Company's CED trials, petitioned the DHHS Office of Inspector General, or OIG, to issue an advisory opinion that if the facility treating Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in one of the CED study protocols reduced or waived any required co-payments based on an individualized assessment of financial ability, the facility would not be subject to civil or administrative penalties under the Social Security Act and regulations. On June 29, 2017, the OIG issued the requested advisory opinion. Although the advisory opinion may provide guidance to healthcare providers other than the facility that submitted the petition, as a legal matter, the opinion only applies to the parties that requested it. In addition, the opinion assumes that the facility would follow specified procedures in conducting its individualized assessment of financial need. We therefore cannot provide any assurances that other healthcare providers will in fact reduce or waive the 20% co-payment on the basis of this advisory opinion.\nOur Intellectual Property Assets Are Critical to Our Success\nWe regard our patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property assets as critical to our success. We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, and trade secret and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions, and other similar measures, to establish and protect our intellectual property. The currently marketed Aurix System is covered by patents that expire in 2019. We attempt to prevent disclosure of our trade secrets by restricting access to sensitive information and requiring employees, consultants, and other persons with access to our sensitive information to sign confidentiality agreements. Despite these efforts, we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter others from developing similar technology in the future. Furthermore, policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property assets is difficult and expensive. Litigation has been necessary in the past and may be necessary in the future in order to protect our intellectual property assets. Litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. We can provide no assurance that we will be successful in any litigation matter relating to our intellectual property assets. Continuing litigation or other challenges could result in one or more of our patents being declared invalid. In such a case, any royalty revenues from the affected patents would be adversely affected although we may still be able to continue to develop and market our products. Furthermore, the unauthorized use of our patented technology by otherwise potential customers in our target markets may significantly undermine our ability to generate sales. Any infringement or challenge to our patents or other misappropriation of our intellectual property assets could have a material adverse effect on our ability to increase sales of our commercial products and/or continue the development of our pipeline candidates.\nWe Rely on a Single Supplier for the Reagent Used for Aurix and an Interruption in Our Supply Chain Could Have a Material Adverse Effect on Our Business\nA reagent used for our Aurix product, bovine thrombin (Thrombin JMI), is available exclusively through Pfizer. Pfizer may unilaterally raise the prices for the reagent. If a temporary or permanent interruption in the supply of the reagent were to occur, or the manufacturing costs charged by Pfizer exceed what we can reasonably afford, it would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAdverse Conditions in the Global Economy and Disruption of Financial Markets May Significantly Restrict Our Ability to Generate Revenues or Obtain Debt or Equity Financing\nThe global economy continues to experience volatility and uncertainty. Such conditions could reduce demand for our products which would significantly jeopardize our ability to achieve meaningful market penetration for Aurix. These conditions could also affect our current and potential strategic partners, which, in turn, could make it much more difficult to execute a strategic collaboration, and therefore significantly jeopardize our ability to fully develop and commercialize our products and product candidates. Global credit and capital markets continue to be relatively challenging. We were unsuccessful in our attempt to complete a public offering of our common stock and related refinancing of our Series A Preferred Stock in 2017 and may continue to be unable to obtain capital through issuance of our equity and/or equity-linked securities. If we are unable to secure funding through strategic collaborations, equity investments, or debt financing, we may not be able to achieve profitability, or fund our research and development, which may result in a cessation of our operations.\nBusiness credit and liquidity have tightened in much of the world. Continuing geopolitical instability and volatility and disruption of financial markets could limit our customers\u2019 ability to obtain adequate financing or credit to purchase and pay for our products in a timely manner, or to maintain operations, and result in a decrease in sales volume. General concerns about the fundamental soundness of domestic and international economies may also cause customers to reduce purchases. Changes in governmental banking, monetary and fiscal policies to restore liquidity and increase credit availability may not be effective. Economic conditions and market turbulence may also impact our suppliers\u2019 ability to supply sufficient quantities of product components in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to fulfill sales orders. It is difficult to determine the extent of the economic and financial market problems and the many ways in which they may affect our suppliers, customers, investors, and business in general. Continuation or further deterioration of these financial and macroeconomic conditions could significantly harm sales, profitability and results of operations.\nOur Products Are Subject to Governmental Regulation\nOur success is also impacted by factors outside of our control. Our current technology and products are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S., both federal and state, and in foreign countries by various regulatory agencies. Specifically, our devices and bio-pharmaceutical products are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and state regulatory agencies. The FDA regulates drugs, medical devices, and biologics that move in interstate commerce and requires that such products receive clearance or pre-marketing approval based on evidence of safety and efficacy. The regulations of government health ministries in foreign countries are analogous to those of the FDA in both application and scope. In addition, any change in current regulatory interpretations by, or positions of, state regulatory officials where our products are used could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell products in those states. The FDA will require us to obtain clearance or approval of new or modified devices when used for treating specific wounds or marketed with specific wound-healing claims, or for other products under development.\nWe believe all our products for sale are legally marketed. As we expand and offer and/or develop additional products in the U.S. and in foreign countries, clearance or approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities prior to introduction of any such products into the market may be required. We provide no assurance that we will be able to obtain all necessary approvals from the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries for these products. Failure to obtain the required approvals would have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nCompliance with FDA and other governmental requirements imposes significant costs and expenses. Further, our failure to comply with these requirements could result in sanctions, limitations on promotional or other business activities, or other adverse effects on our business. Further, recent efforts to control healthcare costs could negatively affect demand for our products and services.\nWe Must Comply With the Physician Payment Sunshine Act\nWe are required to comply with the United States Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, biologicals and medical supplies that participate in U.S. federal healthcare programs to report certain payments and items of value given to physicians and teaching hospitals. Manufacturers are required to report this information annually to CMS. The period between August 1, 2013 and December 31, 2013 was the first reporting period for which manufacturers were required to report aggregate payment data to CMS by March 31, 2014. Manufacturers are required to report aggregate payment data to CMS by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year. We cannot assure you that we will collect and report all data timely and accurately. If we fail to accurately and timely report this information, we could suffer severe penalties. While we timely filed our required report under the Sunshine Act for the years 2014 through 2018, we did not timely file our required report for the initial period, and our failure to do so could subject us to certain fines and penalties as set forth below.\nAny applicable manufacturer that fails to timely, accurately, or completely report the information required in accordance with the rules of the Sunshine Act is subject to a civil monetary penalty of not less than $1,000, but not more than $10,000, for each payment or other transfer of value or ownership or investment interest not reported timely, accurately or completely (up to $150,000). For \u201cknowing\u201d failures to report, the penalties increase to not less than $10,000, but not more than $100,000, for each such failure (up to $1,000,000). The amount of civil monetary penalties imposed on each applicable manufacturer or applicable group purchasing organization is aggregated separately. Subject to separate aggregate totals, the maximum combined annual total is $1,150,000.\nSeveral of the U.S. states have parallel reporting laws, sometimes accompanied with \u201cgift bans\u201d prohibiting manufacturers from making gifts or other remunerations to prescribers. Massachusetts and Vermont are two such states. There are various penalties associated with noncompliance with the state laws, as well.\nClinical Trials May Fail to Demonstrate the Safety or Efficacy of Our Product Candidates\nOur product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in the development of biotherapeutic products. The results of early-stage clinical trials do not necessarily predict the results of later-stage clinical trials. Product candidates in later-stage clinical trials may fail to demonstrate desired safety and efficacy traits despite having successfully progressed through initial clinical testing. For example, we discontinued further funding of the ALD-401 development program following results that demonstrated that observed improvements in the primary endpoint of the trial were not clinically or statistically significant. Even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates is promising, this data may not be sufficient to support approval by the U.S. or foreign regulatory agencies. Pre-clinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways. Accordingly, the regulatory officials could reach different conclusions in assessing such data, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. In addition, the U.S. regulatory authorities, or we, may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time. Any failure or delay in completing clinical trials for product candidates, or in receiving regulatory approval for the sale of any product candidates, has the potential to materially harm our business, and may prevent it from raising necessary, additional financing that may be needed in the future.\nIf clinical trials of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, or do not otherwise produce positive results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct, at our own expense, extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates, including the following:\n\u25cf\nregulators or institutional review boards may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n\u25cf\nclinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon product development programs that we expect to be promising;\n\u25cf\nthe number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;\n\u25cf\nour third party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner or at all;\n\u25cf\nwe might have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u25cf\nregulators or institutional review boards may require that we or our investigators suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\nthe cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u25cf\nwe may be subject to a more complex regulatory process, since stem cell-based therapies are relatively new and regulatory agencies have less experience with them than with traditional pharmaceutical products;\n\u25cf\nthe supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate; and\n\u25cf\nour product candidates may have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, causing us or our investigators to halt or terminate the trials.\nA Disruption in Healthcare Provider Networks Could Have an Adverse Effect on Operations and Profitability\nOur operations and future profitability are dependent, in large part, upon the ability to contract with healthcare providers on favorable terms. In any particular service area, healthcare providers could refuse to contract with us or take other actions that could result in higher healthcare costs, or create difficulties in meeting our regulatory requirements. In some service areas, certain healthcare providers may have a significant market presence. If healthcare providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate unfavorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market services or to be profitable in those service areas could be adversely affected. Provider networks could also be disrupted by the financial insolvency of a large healthcare provider group. Any disruption in provider networks could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLiquidity Problems or Bankruptcy of our Key Customers or Collaborators Could Have a Significant Adverse Effect on our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur sales to customers are typically made on credit without collateral. There is a risk that key customers will not pay, or that payment may be delayed, because of bankruptcy, contraction of credit availability to such customers, weak sales or other factors beyond our control, which could increase our exposure to losses from bad debts. In addition, if our key customers were to cease doing business as a result of bankruptcy or significantly reduce their orders from us, it could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, if our collaborators face liquidity problems or file for bankruptcy, they may choose to divert resources away from their continued cooperation and engagement with us or otherwise choose or be forced to reduce operations, which could also have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nWe May Be Unable to Attract a Strategic Partner for the Further Development of Product Candidates\nEven if positive clinical data is eventually achieved in any future clinical trials, we may not be able to enter into strategic partnerships, out-licensing, or other similar arrangements that we may consider necessary or appropriate to commercialize product candidates successfully, or even have the resources necessary to seek such arrangements. Furthermore, even if such a strategic relationship regarding any of our products or product candidates is reached, development milestones, clinical data, or other such benchmarks may not be achieved. Therefore, our products and product candidates may never proceed toward commercialization or drive cash infusions for us, and we may ultimately not be able to monetize the patents, existing clinical data, and other intellectual property.\nOur Efforts to Secure Commercial Partners May Not Be Successful\nFrom time to time, we engage in discussions with larger companies regarding potential strategic partnerships involving the broad commercialization of Aurix. The resources and expertise of such a partner would greatly facilitate the capture of market share within the wound care market, but would require that the economic benefits of such a broad penetration would be shared with said partner. We may not be successful in securing such a partner. Furthermore, even if a partner is secured, the partnership may not attain the market penetration contemplated, and the profits ultimately realized by us, if any, may not be sufficient to allow us to execute our business strategy.\nWe May Use Third-Party Collaborators and Service Providers to Help Us Support, Develop or Commercialize Our Product Candidates, and Our Ability to Commercialize Such Candidates May Be Impaired or Delayed if such Collaborations or Engagements Are Unsuccessful\nWe do presently and may in the future selectively pursue strategic collaborations or engagements for, among other purposes, development, data collection, analysis, and/or commercialization of our product candidates, domestically or otherwise. There can be no assurance as to our ability to utilize the data from such engagements to their potential. Nor can there be any assurance, in general, that we will be able to identify future suitable collaborators or negotiate collaboration agreements on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. In any current or future third-party collaborations, we are and would be dependent upon the success of the collaborators in performing their responsibilities and their continued cooperation and engagement. For a variety of reasons outside of our control, our collaborators or third-party providers may not cooperate with us or perform their obligations under our agreements with them. We cannot control the amount and timing of our collaborators\u2019 resources that will be devoted to performing their responsibilities under our agreements with them. Our collaborators may choose to pursue alternative technologies in preference to those being developed in collaboration with us. The development and commercialization of our product candidates will be delayed if collaborators fail to conduct their responsibilities in a timely manner or in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or if they breach or terminate their collaboration agreements with us. Disputes with our collaborators could also result in product development delays, decreased revenues and litigation expenses.\nLegislative and Administrative Action May Have an Adverse Effect on Our Company\nPolitical, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the health care industry in the U.S. to fundamental change. We cannot predict what other legislation relating to our business or to the health care industry may be enacted, including legislation relating to third-party reimbursement, or what effect such legislation may have on our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. We expect federal and state legislators to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery and payment systems, and possibly adopt legislation affecting further changes in the health care delivery system. Such laws may contain provisions that may change the operating environment for hospitals and managed care organizations. Health care industry participants may react to such legislation by curtailing or deferring expenditures and initiatives, including those relating to our products. Future legislation could result in modifications to the existing public and private health care insurance systems that would have a material adverse effect on the reimbursement policies discussed above. With growing pressures on government budgets due to the current economic downturn, government efforts to contain or reduce health care spending in some way or another are likely to continue. While members of the current administration and of the Republican majority in Congress have expressed a strong desire to repeal and/or replace the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, colloquially called Obamacare, the scope and timing of any such repeal and/or replacement is highly uncertain. If enacted and implemented, any measures to restrict health care spending could result in decreased revenue from our products and decrease potential returns from our research and development initiatives. Furthermore, we may not be able to successfully neutralize any lobbying efforts against any initiatives we may have with governmental agencies. In addition to legislative initiatives, we may be subject to changes in current regulations and policies affecting coverage and reimbursement for our products. Administrative agencies such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have broad discretion to adopt or modify polices through rulemaking, and adoption of rules that curtail access to our products or limit reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on the adoption of our products by health care providers, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe Could Be Affected by Malpractice or Product Liability Claims\nProviding medical care entails an inherent risk of professional malpractice and other claims. We do not control or direct the practice of medicine by physicians or health care providers who use our products and do not assume responsibility for compliance with regulatory and other requirements directly applicable to physicians. There is no assurance that claims, suits or complaints relating to the use of our products, and treatment administered by physicians, will not be asserted against us in the future. The production, marketing and sale, and use of our products entails risks that product liability claims will be asserted against us. These risks cannot be eliminated, and we could be held liable for any damages that result from adverse reactions or infectious disease transmission. Such liability could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. We currently maintain professional and product liability insurance coverage, but the coverage limits of this insurance may not be adequate to protect against all potential claims. We may not be able to obtain or maintain professional and product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities.\nOur Products Have Existing Competition in the Marketplace and We May Not Be Able to Compete Effectively.\nIn the market for biotechnology products, we face competition from pharmaceutical companies, biopharmaceutical companies, medical device companies, and other competitors. The chronic wound market has many therapies that compete with Aurix that have established habitual use patterns and provider contracts to encourage standardized use. Furthermore, other companies have developed or are developing products that could be in direct future competition with our current product line. Biotechnology development projects are characterized by intense competition. Thus, we may not be the first to the market with any newly developed products and we may not successfully be able to market these products. If we are not able to participate and compete in the regenerative biological therapy market, our financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. We may not be able to compete effectively against such companies in the future. Many of these companies have substantially greater capital resources, larger marketing staffs and more experience in commercializing products than we do. Recently developed technologies, or technologies that may be developed in the future, may be the basis for developments that will compete with our products.\nWe Have Only Limited Experience Manufacturing Product Candidates. We May Not Be Able to Manufacture Product Candidates in Compliance With Evolving Regulatory Standards or in Quantities Sufficient for Commercial Sale.\nComponents of therapeutic products approved for commercial sale or used in late-stage clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP as required by the FDA. Manufacturers of cell-based product candidates also must comply with the FDA\u2019s current good tissue practices, or cGTP. In addition, we may be required to modify our manufacturing process from time-to-time for our product candidates in response to FDA requests if we, in fact, reinitiate cell processing and manufacturing activities in the future. Manufacture of live cellular-based products is complex and subjects us to significant regulatory burdens that may change over time. Regulatory agencies such as the FDA regularly inspect our manufacturing facilities as well as those of our third-party suppliers, and may issue FDA Forms 483 \u201cInspectional Observations\u201d\u009d in connection with those inspections from time to time. If the FDA\u2019s inspections uncover significant violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and/or related acts, and the violations are not appropriately remedied within the time periods requested by the FDA, the FDA may take regulatory action against us, including the imposition of civil or criminal monetary sanctions or penalties, product recalls or seizure, injunctions, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, and suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals.\nWe may encounter difficulties in the production of our product candidates due to our limited manufacturing capabilities. We have only limited manufacturing experience with previous product candidates, and we currently do not have sufficient manufacturing capacity to support commercialization. These difficulties could reduce sales of our products, if they are approved for marketing, increase our costs or cause production delays, any of which could damage our reputation and hurt our profitability.\nIf we successfully obtain marketing approval for any product candidates, we may not be able to efficiently produce sufficient quantities of these products to meet potential commercial demand. We expect that we would need to significantly expand our manufacturing capabilities to meet potential demand for these products. Such expansion would require additional regulatory approvals. We may also encounter difficulties in the commercial-scale manufacture of our product candidates. Improving the speed and efficiency of our manufacturing process and the cell sorters and other instruments we use will be key to our success. However, we may not be able to develop process enhancements on a timely basis, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we fail to develop these improvements, we could face significantly higher capital expenditures than we anticipate, increased facility and personnel costs and other increased operating expenses. We may need to demonstrate that our product candidates manufactured using any new processes or instruments are comparable to our product candidates used in clinical trials. Depending on the type and degree of differences, we may be required to conduct additional studies or clinical trials to demonstrate comparability.\nIn addition, some changes in our manufacturing processes or procedures, including a change in the location where a product candidate is manufactured, generally require prior FDA or foreign regulatory authority review and approval for determining our compliance with cGMP and cGTP. We may need to conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials to support approval of any such changes. Furthermore, this review process could be costly and time-consuming and could delay or prevent the commercialization of our product candidates.\nIf Our Patent Position Does Not Adequately Protect Our Product Candidates or Any Future Products, Others Could Compete Against Us More Directly, Which Would Harm Our Business\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our product candidates. Issued patents may be challenged by third parties, resulting in patents being deemed invalid, unenforceable or narrowed in scope, or a third party may circumvent any such issued patents. The patent position of biotechnology companies is generally highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has been the subject of much litigation and recent court decisions introducing uncertainty in the strength of patents owned by biotechnology companies. The legal systems of some foreign countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Therefore, any patents that we own or license may not provide sufficient protection against competitors.\nThe claims of the issued patents that are licensed to us, and the claims of any patents which may issue in the future and be owned by or licensed to us, may not confer on us significant commercial protection against competing products. Also, our pending patent applications may not issue, and we may not receive any additional patents. Our patents might not contain claims that are sufficiently broad to prevent others from utilizing our technologies. Consequently, our competitors may independently develop competing products that do not infringe our patents or other intellectual property. To the extent a competitor can develop similar products using a different chemistry, our patents may not prevent others from directly competing with us. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, a patent having claims that encompass one or more product candidates may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization of the product candidates, thereby reducing any advantages of the patent. For instance, three of our U.S. patents relating to our technology will expire in 2019. To the extent our product candidates based on that technology are not commercialized significantly ahead of this date, or to the extent we have no other patent protection on such product candidates, those product candidates would not be protected by patents beyond 2019 and we would then rely solely on other forms of exclusivity, such as regulatory exclusivity provided by the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which may provide less protection of our competitive position. Similar considerations apply in any other country where we are prosecuting patents, have been issued patents, or have licensed patents or patent applications relating to our technology.\nIf We Are Unable to Protect the Confidentiality of Our Proprietary Information and Know-how, Our Competitive Position Would be Impaired\nA significant amount of our technology, especially regarding manufacturing processes, is unpatented and is maintained by us as trade secrets. The background technologies used in the development of our product candidates are known in the scientific community, and it is possible to duplicate the methods we use to create our product candidates. In an effort to protect these trade secrets, we require our employees, consultants and contractors to execute confidentiality agreements with us. These agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual\u2019s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties. These agreements, however, may not provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information, and these agreements may be breached. Adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information. A breach of confidentiality could affect our competitive position. In addition, in some situations, these agreements may conflict with, or be subject to, the rights of third parties with whom our employees, consultants, collaborators or advisors have previous employment or consulting relationships. Also, others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets. The disclosure of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position.\nIf We Infringe, or Are Alleged to Infringe, Intellectual Property Rights of Third Parties, Our Business Could be Harmed\nOur research, development and commercialization activities, including any product candidates resulting from these activities, may infringe, or be claimed to infringe, patents or other proprietary rights owned by third parties, and to which we do not hold licenses or other rights. There may be patent applications owned by third parties that have been filed but not published that, when issued, could be asserted against us. These third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and, if successful against us, could cause us to pay substantial damages.\nFurther, if a patent infringement suit were brought against us, we could be forced to stop or delay research, development, manufacturing or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit. We have not conducted an exhaustive search or analysis of third-party patent rights to determine whether our research, development or commercialization activities, including any product candidates resulting from these activities, may infringe or be alleged to infringe any third-party patent rights. As a result of intellectual property infringement claims, or in order to avoid potential claims, we may choose or be required to seek a license from the third party. These licenses may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we are able to obtain a license, the licensee would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both, and the rights granted to us might be nonexclusive, which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property.\nUltimately, we could be prevented from commercializing a product, or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations, if, as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims, we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms. All of the issues described above could also affect our potential collaborators to the extent we have any collaborations then in place, which would also affect the success of the collaboration and therefore us. There has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. In addition to infringement claims against us, we may become a party to other patent litigation and other proceedings, including inter partes review and/or interference proceedings declared by the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office and opposition proceedings in the European Patent Office, regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our product candidates and technology.\nOur Business May Be Adversely Impacted by Cyber-Security Attacks\nDisruption in our computer systems could adversely affect our business. We rely on computer systems to process transactions, communicate with customers, manage our business, and process and maintain information. We have measures in places to monitor and protect our computer systems, but these measures might not be sufficient protection from unpredicted events. Cyber-security attacks are evolving and disruptions can be caused by a variety of events, such as viruses, malicious malware, unauthorized access attempts to data, or other types of cyber-security attacks. Such events could produce disruptions that result in an unexpected delay in operations, loss of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, and expenses related to the repair or replacement of our computer systems. Compromising and/or loss of information could result in loss of sales or legal or regulatory claims which could adversely affect our revenues and profits or damage our reputation.\nAny Product for Which We Obtain Marketing Approval Will Be Subject to Extensive Ongoing Regulatory Requirements, and We May Be Subject to Penalties if We Fail to Comply with Regulatory Requirements or if We Experience Unanticipated Problems with Our Products, When and if Any of Them Are Approved\nAny product for which we obtain marketing approval, along with the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, advertising, and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration requirements, cGMP and cGTP requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements relating to product labeling, advertising and promotion, and recordkeeping. Even if regulatory approval of a product is granted, the approval may be subject to additional limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to other conditions of approval. In addition, approval may contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. Discovery after approval of previously unknown problems with our products, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in actions such as:\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on such products\u2019 manufacturing processes;\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on the marketing of a product;\n\u25cf\nrestrictions on product distribution;\n\u25cf\nrequirements to conduct post-marketing clinical trials;\n\u25cf\nwarning letters;\n\u25cf\nwithdrawal of the products from the market;\n\u25cf\nrefusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications that we submit;\n\u25cf\nrecall of products;\n\u25cf\nfines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenue;\n\u25cf\nsuspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals;\n\u25cf\nrefusal to permit the import or export of our products;\n\u25cf\nproduct seizure;\n\u25cf\ninjunctions; or\n\u25cf\nimposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nFailure to Obtain Regulatory Approval in International Jurisdictions Would Prevent Us from Marketing Products Abroad\nWe may in the future seek to market some of our product candidates outside the U.S. In order to market our product candidates in the European Union and many other jurisdictions, we must submit clinical data concerning our product candidates and obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval from foreign regulators may be longer than the time required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process outside the U.S. may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. In addition, in many countries outside the U.S., it is required that the product candidate be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that country. In some cases this may include approval of the price we intend to charge for our product, if approved. We may not obtain approvals from regulatory authorities outside the U.S. on a timely basis, or at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval by one regulatory authority outside the U.S. does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions or by the FDA, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively affect the regulatory process in other countries. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize any products in any market and therefore may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to support our business.\nRisks Related to the Common Stock\nOur Common Stock is Currently Quoted on an Over-the-Counter Market, Which Affects the Liquidity of Our Common Stock.\nQuotation of the common stock commenced on OTCQB on January 20, 2017 under the trading symbol \u201cAURX\u201d. Trading in our common stock has been very limited and we cannot make any assurances that the trading volume will increase, or, if and when it increases, that it will be sustained at any level. Over-the-counter markets are generally considered to be less efficient than, and not as broad as, a stock exchange.\nOur share price could decrease as a result of this limited liquidity or otherwise, and our share price is likely to be highly volatile. Specifically, stockholders may have difficulties reselling significant numbers of shares of common stock at any particular time, and may not be able to resell their shares of common stock at or above the price paid for such shares. As a result, stockholders may be required to hold shares of common stock for an indefinite period of time. In addition, sales of substantial amounts of common stock could lower the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nFurthermore, our ability to raise additional capital is impaired because of the less liquid nature of the over-the-counter markets. We may not be able to complete an equity financing on acceptable terms, or at all. In that context, investors should consider that not having the common stock listed on a national securities exchange makes us ineligible to use shorter and less costly filings, such as Form S-3, to register our securities for sale. While we may use Form S-1 to register a sale of our stock to raise capital or complete acquisitions, doing so would cause us to incur higher transaction costs and adversely impact our ability to raise capital or complete acquisitions of other companies in a timely manner. In addition, if we are able to complete equity financings, the dilution from any equity financing while our shares are quoted on an over-the-counter market could be greater than if we were to complete a financing while our common stock were listed on a national securities exchange.\nIn recent years the stock market in general, and the market for life sciences companies in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies, often for reasons unrelated to their operating performance, and it may adversely affect the price of our common stock. These broad market fluctuations may reduce the demand for our stock and therefore adversely affect the price of our securities, regardless of operating performance. See also \u201c- U.S. Broker-Dealers May Be Discouraged from Effecting Transactions in Shares of our common stock.\u201d\nFinally, if we cease to qualify for quotation on OTCQB, our common stock may be forced to trade on the \u201cpink sheets,\u201d and the market for resale of our common stock would be extremely limited. In that case, holders of our common stock may find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of, our common stock, and the market value of our common stock may decline as a result.\nThe Rights of the Holders of our Common Stock and the Value of our Common Stock are Severely Limited by the 2018 Convertible Notes and the Liquidation Preference and Other Terms of our Series A Preferred Stock\nOn April 30, 2019, our right to prepay the 2018 Convertible Notes will terminate, and the rights of the holders to convert the notes will commence. So long as the 2018 Convertible Notes are outstanding, no dividend or other distribution on shares of the Company\u2019s capital stock may be declared or paid without the consent of the holders of the notes, and the holders have the right to consent to certain other transactions, including borrowings and sales of assets.\nOn May 5, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation with the Delaware Secretary of State, designating 29,038 shares of the Company\u2019s undesignated preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, as Series A Preferred Stock. On May 5, 2016, the Company issued 29,038 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to Deerfield in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock has no stated maturity date, is not convertible or redeemable and carries a liquidation preference of $29,038,000, which is required to be paid to holders of such Series A Preferred Stock before any payments are made with respect to shares of common stock (and other capital stock that is not issued on parity or senior to the Series A Preferred Stock) upon a liquidation or change in control transaction.\nIn addition, the rights of our holders of common stock with respect to their common stock are limited by and subject to the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to dividends, voting rights, election of directors, and the right to approve certain material transactions, among other things.\nFor so long as Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, holders of two-thirds of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock must approve a change in the number of our directors (currently five) and the holders of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to nominate and elect one member of our Board of Directors. Lawrence S. Atinsky serves as the director designee of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock, which are all currently affiliates of Deerfield Management Company, L.P., of which Mr. Atinsky is a Partner.\nWith respect to all other matters on which holders of common stock may vote, the Series A Preferred Stock also have voting rights, voting with the common stock as a single class, with each share of Series A Preferred Stock having the right to five votes, currently representing approximately one percent (1%) of the voting rights of the capital stock of the Company.\nFurthermore, holders of two-thirds of our outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to approve certain transactions, including transactions to:\n\u25cf\namend, modify, or repeal any provision of the Certificate of Designation for our Series A Preferred Stock or the Bylaws in a manner that adversely affect the preferences, rights or powers of, or any restrictions provided for the benefit of, the Series A Preferred Stock,\n\u25cf\nissue securities that are senior to or pari passu with the Series A Preferred Stock,\n\u25cf\nincur debt (other than for working capital purposes not in excess of $3.0 million),\n\u25cf\nissue securities that are junior to the Series A Preferred Stock and that provide certain consent rights to the holders of such junior securities in connection with a liquidation or contain certain liquidation preferences,\n\u25cf\npay dividends on or purchase shares of its capital stock (with certain exceptions),\n\u25cf\nchange the authorized number of members of its Board of Directors to a number other than five, or\n\u25cf\nconsummate or consent to any liquidation in which the holders of Series A Preferred Stock do not receive in cash at the closing of any such event or occurrence the Series A liquidation preference for each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock.\nIf It Is Determined That We Were Required to File a Consent Solicitation Statement on Schedule 14A In Connection With the Approval of our 2016 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, We Could Be Subject to Penalties, Fines or Damages.\nOn November 23, 2016, we filed an Information Statement on Schedule 14C with the SEC to inform the Company\u2019s stockholders that a written consent had been executed by stockholders holding a majority of the shares of voting stock of the Company, which approved the Company\u2019s 2016 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended. The stockholders that signed the written consent were officers and directors of the Company and a small number of stockholders that participated in the private placement effected in connection with our Plan of Reorganization. Although we provided the Information Statement to the limited number of stockholders from whom we solicited consents at the time of such solicitation, we did not file a Consent Solicitation Statement on Schedule 14A. If it is determined that such filing was required under Regulation 14A, we could be subject to penalties, fines or damages.\nAs Long As We Are Not Listed on an Exchange or Nasdaq, U.S. Broker-Dealers May Be Discouraged from Effecting Transactions in Shares of our Common Stock\nThe SEC has adopted a number of rules to regulate \u201cpenny stock\u201d that restricts transactions involving our shares of common stock. Such rules include Rules 3a51-1, 15g-1, 15g-2, 15g-3, 15g-4, 15g-5, 15g-6, 15g-7, and 15g-9 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. These rules may have the effect of reducing the liquidity of penny stocks. \u201cPenny stocks\u201d generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exclusions. As long as we are not listed on a securities exchange or Nasdaq, our shares of common stock constitute \u201cpenny stock\u201d within the meaning of the rules. The additional sales practice and disclosure requirements imposed upon U.S. broker-dealers in connection with effecting transactions in \u201cpenny stocks\u201d may discourage such broker-dealers from effecting transactions in shares of our common stock, which could severely limit the market liquidity of such shares and impede their sale in the secondary market.\nA U.S. broker-dealer selling penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or \u201caccredited investor\u201d (generally, an individual with net worth, excluding the value of the primary residence, in excess of $1,000,000 or an annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with his or her spouse) must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and must receive the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to sale, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. In addition, the penny stock regulations require the U.S. broker-dealer to deliver, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared in accordance with SEC standards relating to the penny stock market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt. A U.S. broker-dealer is also required to disclose commissions payable to the U.S. broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, a U.S. broker-dealer is required to submit monthly statements disclosing recent price information with respect to the penny stock held in a customer\u2019s account and information with respect to the limited market in penny stocks.\nIn addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules described above, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.\nFurthermore, transfers of our common stock may require broker-dealers to submit notice filings and pay fees in certain states, which may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock.\nYou should also be aware that, according to the SEC, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include (i) control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer; (ii) manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases; (iii) \u201cboiler room\u201d practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons; (iv) excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and (v) the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, resulting in investor losses.\nOur Officers, Directors and Principal Stockholders Can Exert Significant Influence Over Us and May Make Decisions That Are Not in the Best Interests of All Stockholders\nAs of March 31, 2019, our officers and directors beneficially owned approximately 23.8% of our shares of common stock, while principal stockholders Charles E. Sheedy and Boyalife Investment Fund I, Inc. together beneficially owned an additional approximately 62.9% of our shares of common stock. For these purposes, beneficial ownership was calculated to include all shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of options or warrants exercisable as of the date above, or exercisable within 60 days after such date. In addition, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to nominate and elect one member of our Board of Directors. The Series A Preferred Stock have voting rights, voting with the common stock as a single class, with each share of Series A Preferred Stock having the right to five votes, currently representing approximately one percent (1%) of the voting rights of the capital stock of the Company, and the holders of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to approve certain transactions and incurrences of debt.\nAs a result, our officers, directors, principal holders of common stock and holders of Series A Preferred Stock are able to affect the outcome of, or exert significant influence over, all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any change in control. This concentration of ownership of our common stock and our Series A Preferred Stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us or otherwise discouraging or preventing a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us. This, in turn, could have a negative effect on the market price of our common stock, if and when it commences trading. It could also prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market prices for their shares of common stock. Moreover, the interests of this concentration of ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders, and accordingly, they could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that we would not otherwise consider.\nTransactions Engaged in by Our Largest Stockholders, Our Directors or Officers Involving Our Common Stock May Have an Adverse Effect on the Price of Our Common Stock\nSales of our common stock by our officers, directors and principal stockholders could have the effect of lowering our stock price. In connection with the Recapitalization Transaction, we agreed to file a registration statement covering the resale of securities issued in that transaction. The perceived risk associated with the possible sale of a large number of shares of common stock by those stockholders could cause some of our stockholders to sell their stock, thus causing the price of our common stock to decline. In addition, actual or anticipated downward pressure on our stock price due to actual or anticipated sales of common stock by our largest stockholders, directors or officers could cause other institutions or individuals to engage in short sales of our common stock, which may further cause the price of our stock to decline.\nFrom time to time our largest stockholders, directors and executive officers may sell shares of our common stock on the open market. These sales will be publicly disclosed in filings made with the SEC. In the future, our largest stockholders, directors and executive officers may sell a significant number of shares for a variety of reasons unrelated to the performance of our business. Our stockholders may perceive these sales as a reflection on management\u2019s view of the business, which may result in some stockholders selling their shares of our common stock. These sales could cause the price of our stock to drop.\nVolatility of Our Stock Price Could Adversely Affect Current and Future Stockholders\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate widely in response to various factors which are beyond our control. The price of our common stock is not necessarily indicative of our operating performance or long-term business prospects. In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Factors that could cause the market price to fluctuate substantially include, among others:\n\u25cf\nour ability or inability to execute our business plan;\n\u25cf\nthe dilutive effect or perceived dilutive effect of additional equity financings;\n\u25cf\ninvestor perception of our company and of the industry;\n\u25cf\nthe success of competitive products or technologies;\n\u25cf\nregulatory developments in the U.S. or overseas;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel; or\n\u25cf\ngeneral economic, political and market conditions.\nThe stock market in general has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. Continued market fluctuations could result in extreme volatility in the price of our common stock, which could cause a decline in the value of our common stock. Price volatility could be worse if the trading volume of our common stock is low.\nThe Potential Conversion of the 2018 Convertible Notes and the Exercise of Warrants or Options Will Likely Cause Substantial Dilution to Our Existing Stockholders\nWe have $350,000 of principal outstanding under the 2018 Convertible Notes, and interest accruing on such principal at 12% per annum. Commencing on April 30, 2019, the principal and accrued interest under such notes are convertible at the discretion of the holders of the notes, into common stock at a conversion price corresponding to a 40% discount to the average of the two lowest trading prices of the common stock during the 25 trading days prior to the conversion, subject to certain adjustments and price-protection provisions contained in the notes, including full-ratchet anti-dilution protection in the case of the dilutive issuance of securities that do not meet the requirements of an \u201cexempt issuance\u201d as defined in the notes. The conversion of the 2018 Convertible Notes would therefore materially dilute our current stockholders. By way of illustration, if the holders of our 2018 Convertible Notes had chosen to convert the principal balance of their notes in full on April 10, 2019, they would have received approximately 1.7 million shares of our common stock upon conversion, or approximately 7% of our outstanding common stock on a post-conversion basis.\nIn the Recapitalization Transaction, we issued warrants, or 2016 Warrants, to purchase an aggregate of 6,180,000 shares of common stock to certain of the selling stockholders. The 2016 Warrants terminate on May 5, 2021 and are exercisable at prices ranging from $0.50 per share to $0.75 per share. In conjunction with the issuance of 2018 Convertible Notes we issued warrants, or 2018 Warrants, to purchase 466,666 shares of common stock to the holders of the notes. The warrants terminate on September 17, 2023 and are exercisable at $0.15 per share. The exercise of these warrants may cause substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and affect the market price of the common stock.\nIn addition, our Board of Directors has granted options to purchase shares of common stock to certain of our employees and directors under our 2016 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended and restated, or the Omnibus Plan, of which 1,616,876 remained outstanding as of December 31, 2018. The exercise of these options may also cause dilution to our existing stockholders and affect the market price of the common stock.\nWe May Likely Issue Additional Equity or Debt Securities Which Will Likely Dilute and May Materially and Adversely Affect the Price of Our Common Stock\nAdditional issuance of our common stock or other equity or convertible debt securities will likely dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that those sales may occur, could negatively affect the market price of our common stock. We have used, and will likely continue to use, our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock to fund working capital needs or to acquire technology, product rights or businesses, or for other purposes. If additional equity and/or equity-linked securities are issued, particularly during times when our common stock is trading at relatively low price levels, the price of our common stock may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are Subject to Anti-Takeover Provisions and Laws\nProvisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws and applicable provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our Board of Directors. These provisions may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting common stock or delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer or proxy contest, which may negatively affect the price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90750, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "NUOTQ"}
