{"cik": "1123494", "company": "HARVARD BIOSCIENCE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nThe following factors should be reviewed carefully, in conjunction with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As previously discussed, our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our business faces a variety of risks. These risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial. If any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors occur our business operations, performance and financial condition could be adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nSustained uncertainty concerning government spending and adverse changes in general economic conditions may continue to adversely affect our business.\nMany of our customers representing a significant portion of our revenues are universities, government research laboratories, private foundations and other institutions who are dependent for their funding upon grants from U.S. government agencies, such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health (\u201cNIH\u201d), and agencies in other countries. Research and development spending of our customers can fluctuate based on spending priorities and general economic conditions. The level of government funding of research and development is unpredictable. There have been instances where NIH grants have been frozen or otherwise unavailable for extended periods. Any potential delay or decrease in the level of governmental spending allocated to scientific and medical research could substantially reduce or even eliminate these grants causing our customers to delay or forego purchases of our products. If government funding necessary to purchase our products were to decrease, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Spending by some of these customers fluctuates based on budget allocations and the timely passage of the annual federal budget. An impasse in federal government budget decisions could lead to substantial delays or reductions in federal spending.\nAs our business has grown, we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions. Continued concerns about credit markets, consumer confidence, economic conditions, government spending to sponsor life science research, volatile corporate profits and reduced capital spending could continue to negatively impact demand for our products. If economic growth in the U.S. and other countries continues to be slow and does not improve, customers may delay purchases of our products. The tightening of credit in financial markets may adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing, which could result in a decrease in, or deferrals or cancellations of, the sale of our products. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in the United States, deteriorate, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Unstable economic, political and social conditions make it difficult for our customers, our suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. If such conditions exist, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer. We cannot project the extent of the impact of the economic environment on our industry or us.\nA portion of our revenues are derived from customers from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries and are subject to risks faced by those industries. Such risks may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe derive a portion of our revenues from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. We expect that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies will continue to be a significant source of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks and uncertainties that affect the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, such as government regulation, ongoing consolidation, uncertainty of technological change, and reductions and delays in research and development expenditures by companies in these industries.\nIn particular, the biotechnology industry is largely dependent on raising capital to fund its operations. If biotechnology companies that are our customers are unable to obtain the financing necessary to purchase our products, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, we are dependent, both directly and indirectly, upon general health care spending patterns, particularly in the research and development budgets of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, as well as upon the financial condition and purchasing patterns of various governments and government agencies. As it relates to both the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, many companies have significant patents that have expired or are about to expire, which could result in reduced revenues for those companies. If pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies that are our customers suffer reduced revenues as a result of these patent expirations, they may be unable to purchase our products, and our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have experienced a significant amount of consolidation. As a result of this consolidation, competition to provide life science research tools has increased which could result in additional pressure on the prices of our products.\nOur business is subject to economic, political and other risks associated with international revenues and operations.\nWe manufacture and sell our products worldwide and as a result, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Our revenues from our non-U.S. operations represented approximately 41% of total revenues for 2014. We anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future and is likely to increase as a result of our efforts to expand our business in markets abroad. In addition, a number of our manufacturing facilities and suppliers are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nthe impact of recessions and other economic conditions in economies outside the United States,\n\u00b7\ninability to effectively expand our business and operations in international markets,\n\u00b7\ndisruptions of capital and trading markets,\n\u00b7\ninability to collect accounts receivable,\n\u00b7\nlimitations on repatriations of funds, as well as our inability to utilize overseas cash balances to fund U.S. based operations, obligations and strategic acquisitions in a cost-effective manner, or at all,\n\u00b7\npotentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws affecting the ability to or cost of repatriating profits,\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations, unfavorable labor regulations applicable to European operations, such as severance and the unenforceability of non-competition agreements in the European Union,\n\u00b7\nother factors beyond our control, including terrorism, political unrest, acts of war, natural disasters and diseases,\n\u00b7\nunexpected changes and increased enforcement of regulatory requirements and various state, federal and international, environmental, antitrust, anti-corruption, fraud and abuse (including anti-kickback and false claims laws) and employment laws, and\n\u00b7\ninterruption to transportation flows for delivery of parts to us and finished goods to our customers.\nSpecifically with respect to the expansion of our business into China, our financial performance may be subject to the following risks, among others affecting companies that operate in China:\n\u00b7\nRegulation of foreign investment and business activities by the Chinese government, including recent scrutiny of foreign companies, may limit our ability to expand our business in China,\n\u00b7\nUncertainties with respect to the legal system in China, may limit the legal protections available to us in China,\n\u00b7\nWe may be subject to government restrictions on the remittance of currency out of China and the ability of any subsidiary we may establish in China to pay dividends and make other distributions to us,\n\u00b7\nWe may be subject to unfavorable tax consequences as a result of our operations in China.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations may have a negative impact on our reported earnings.\nWe are also subject to the risks of fluctuating foreign exchange rates, which could have a materially adverse effect on the sales price of our products in foreign markets, as well as the costs and expenses of our foreign subsidiaries. Approximately 38% of our business during 2014 was conducted in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which is our reporting currency. As a result, currency fluctuations among the U.S. dollar, euro and the other currencies in which we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency translation and transaction gains and losses. We have not used forward exchange contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposures. We attempt to manage foreign currency risk through the matching of assets and liabilities. In the future, we may undertake to manage foreign currency risk through hedging methods, including foreign currency contracts. We recognize foreign currency gains or losses arising from our operations in the period incurred. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in managing foreign currency risk or in predicting the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposure and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can address these risks.\nOur revenues will likely be affected by various factors, including the timing of purchases by customers and the seasonal nature of purchasing in Europe.\nOur revenues will likely be affected by various factors, including the seasonal nature of purchasing in Europe. Our revenues may vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, including new product introductions, the release of grant and budget funding, future acquisitions and our substantial sales to European customers, who in summer months often defer purchases. In particular, delays or reduction in purchase orders from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could have a material adverse effect on us and could adversely affect our stock price.\nWe plan to expand our business in the near future into foreign countries and international markets. If our products are not accepted in these new markets our financial performance may suffer.\nWe are undertaking an initiative to aggressively expand our sales and marketing efforts in foreign countries and international markets. The cost and diversion of resources to these efforts may not result in an increase in revenues in our business. Expansion of our business into new markets may be more costly and require the devotion of more of our management\u2019s time than we anticipate, which may hurt our business performance in other markets. Our operating results may suffer to the extent that our efforts to expand our products sales in these new markets are delayed or prove to be unsuccessful.\nIf we are not able to manage our growth, our operating profits or losses may be adversely impacted.\nOur success will depend on the expansion of our operations through both organic growth and acquisitions. Effective growth management will place increased demands on our management team, operational and financial resources and expertise. To manage growth, we must expand our facilities, augment our operational, financial and management systems, and hire and train additional qualified personnel. Failure to manage this growth effectively could impair our ability to generate revenue or could cause our expenses to increase more rapidly than revenue, resulting in operating losses or reduced profitability.\nWe may be unsuccessful in developing new products for existing markets.\nOur strategy includes developing new products to drive organic growth in our businesses. We may be unsuccessful developing new products that are received in existing markets. The products we develop may have less market demand than we anticipate or the demand may be at substantially lower prices than we anticipate. Our competitors may develop new products or technologies that diminish demand for our new products. Our customers may receive decreased funding levels, which may cause their demand for our products to decrease. Our efforts to develop new intellectual property and new products may be costly. Failure in our new product development program could have a material impact on our results of operation and our financial condition.\nOur competitors and potential competitors may develop products and technologies that are more effective or commercially attractive than our products.\nWe expect to encounter increased competition from both established and development-stage companies that continually enter the market. We anticipate that these competitors will include:\n\u00b7\ncompanies developing and marketing life science instruments, systems and lab consumables,\n\u00b7\nhealth care companies that manufacture laboratory-based tests and analyzers,\n\u00b7\ndiagnostic and pharmaceutical companies,\n\u00b7\nanalytical instrument companies, and\n\u00b7\ncompanies developing life science or drug discovery technologies.\nCurrently, our principal competition comes from established companies that provide products that perform many of the same functions for which we market our products. Our competitors may develop or market products that are more effective or commercially attractive than our current or future products. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, operational, marketing and technical resources than we do. Moreover, these competitors may offer broader product lines and tactical discounts, and may have greater name recognition. In addition, we may face competition from new entrants into the field. We may not have the financial resources, technical expertise or marketing, distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully in the future.\nOur products compete in markets that are subject to technological change, and therefore one or more of our products could be made obsolete by new technologies.\nBecause the market for life science tools is characterized by technological change and frequent new product introductions, our product lines may be made obsolete unless we are able to continually improve existing products and develop new products. To meet the evolving needs of customers, we must continually enhance our current and planned products and develop and introduce new products. However, we may experience difficulties that may delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of new products or product enhancements. In addition, our product lines are based on complex technologies that are subject to change as new technologies are developed and introduced in the marketplace. We may have difficulty in keeping abreast of the changes affecting each of the different markets we serve or intend to serve. Our failure to develop and introduce products in a timely manner in response to changing technology, market demands or the requirements of our customers could cause our product sales to decline, and we could experience significant losses.\nWe offer and plan to offer a broad product line and have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial expenses for development of new products and enhanced versions of our existing products. The speed of technological change in our market may prevent us from being able to successfully market some or all of our products for the length of time required to recover development costs. Failure to recover the development costs of one or more products or product lines could decrease our profitability or cause us to experience significant losses.\nAttractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us in the future.\nWe will consider the acquisition of other businesses. However, we may not have the opportunity to make suitable acquisitions on favorable terms in the future, which could negatively impact the growth of our business. In order to pursue such opportunities, we may require significant additional financing, which may not be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. We expect that our competitors, many of which have significantly greater resources than we do, will compete with us to acquire compatible businesses. This competition could increase prices for acquisitions that we would likely pursue. In addition, to the extent we acquire any businesses or engage in certain other corporate transactions during the two year period following the spin-off of HART, we intend to structure such transactions in a manner that complies with certain safe harbors provided by the U.S. Treasury regulations, as discussed above. Such structuring requirements may discourage us from entering into certain transactions which we would otherwise pursue.\nWith respect to acquisitions we have completed or may seek to consummate in the future, we have and will incur a variety of costs, and may never realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions due in part to difficulties integrating the businesses, operations and product lines.\nOur business strategy includes the acquisition of businesses, technologies, services or products that we believe are a strategic fit with our business. In October 2014, we completed the acquisition of two privately held life science companies: Multi Channel Systems MCS GmbH, a German company with limited liability headquartered in Reutlingen, Germany (\u201cMCS\u201d) and Triangle BioSystems, Inc., a Delaware corporation based in Durham, North Carolina (\u201cTBSI\u201d). In January 2015, we completed the acquisition of all of the operations of HEKA Electronik, a privately held biomedical instrumentation and software business with headquarters in Germany (\u201cHEKA\u201d). With respect to these recent acquisitions or if we undertake any future acquisition, the process of integrating the acquired business, technology, service or product may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business. Moreover, we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition as rapidly as expected or at all. Any such recent or future acquisitions could reduce stockholders\u2019 ownership, cause us to incur debt, expose us to future liabilities and result in amortization expenses related to intangible assets with definite lives, which may adversely impact our ability to undertake future acquisitions on substantially similar terms. We may also incur significant expenditures in anticipation of an acquisition that is never realized.\nOur ability to achieve the benefits of acquisitions depends in part on the integration and leveraging of technology, operations, sales and marketing channels and personnel. The integration process is a complex, time-consuming and expensive process and may disrupt our business if not completed in a timely and efficient manner.\nWe may have difficulty successfully integrating acquired businesses, and their domestic and foreign operations or product lines, and as a result, we may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions we make. We cannot assure that our growth rate will equal the growth rates that have been experienced by us and these and other acquired companies, respectively, operating as separate companies in the past.\nCustomer, vendor and employee uncertainty about the effects of any of our acquisitions could harm us.\nWe and the customers of any company we acquire, including MCS, TBSI and HEKA and others in the future, may, in response to the consummation of the acquisition, delay or defer purchasing decisions. Any delay or deferral in purchasing decisions by customers could adversely affect our business. Similarly, employees of acquired companies may experience uncertainty about their future role until or after we execute our post-acquisition strategies. This may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key management, sales, marketing and technical personnel following an acquisition.\nWe may be the subject of lawsuits from either an acquiring company\u2019s stockholders, an acquired company\u2019s previous stockholders, a divested company\u2019s stockholders or our current stockholders.\nWe may be the subject of lawsuits from either an acquiring company\u2019s stockholders, an acquired company\u2019s previous stockholders, a divested company\u2019s stockholders or our current stockholders. Such lawsuits could result from the actions of the acquisition or divestiture target prior to the date of the acquisition or divestiture, from the acquisition or divestiture transaction itself or from actions after the acquisition or divestiture. Defending potential lawsuits could cost us significant expense and detract management\u2019s attention from the operation of the business. Additionally, these lawsuits could result in the cancellation of or the inability to renew certain insurance coverage that would be necessary to protect our assets.\nWe will incur additional restructuring costs or not realize the expected benefits of our initiatives to reduce operating expenses to date and in the future.\nIn 2014, we initiated plans to relocate the distribution and finance operations of Denville Scientific from South Plainfield, NJ to a new leased facility in Charlotte, NC and our headquarters in Holliston, MA, respectively, and to relocate the manufacturing and marketing operations of Biochrom from Cambridge, United Kingdom to our headquarters in Holliston, MA. In addition to these actions, we may seek to further eliminate certain inefficiencies in our corporate structure in the future. We may not be able to implement all of the actions that we intend to take in the restructuring of our operations and we may not be able to fully realize the expected benefits from such realignment and restructuring plans or other similar restructurings in the future. In addition, we may incur additional restructuring costs in implementing such realignment and restructuring plans or other similar future plans in excess of our expectations, and due to such restructuring efforts we may experience disruptions to our ongoing business operations, including manufacturing, distribution, sales and information technology systems, that could adversely impact the ongoing business and our results of operations. The implementation of our restructuring efforts, including the reduction of our workforce, may not improve our operational and cost structure or result in greater efficiency of our organization; and we may not be able to support sustainable revenue growth and profitability following such restructurings.\nFailure or inadequacy of our information technology infrastructure or software could adversely affect our day-to-day operations and decision making processes and have an adverse effect on our performance.\nWe depend on accurate and timely information and numerical data from key software applications to aid our day-to-day business, financial reporting and decision-making and, in many cases, proprietary and custom-designed software is necessary to operate our business. We are upgrading our disaster recovery procedures for our critical systems. However, any disruption caused by the failure of these systems, the underlying equipment, or communication networks, including as a result of our restructuring efforts, could delay or otherwise adversely impact our day-to-day business and decision making, could make it impossible for us to operate critical equipment, and could have a materially adverse effect on our performance, if our disaster recovery plans do not mitigate the disruption. Disruptions could be caused by a variety of factors, such as catastrophic events or weather, power outages, or cyber-attacks on our systems by outside parties.\nAny failure by us to protect confidential information of our customers against security breaches, including cyber-security breaches, could damage our reputation and substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nThird parties may have the technology or expertise to breach the security of our customer transaction data and our security measures may not prevent physical security or cyber-security breaches, which could result in substantial harm to our business, our reputation and our results of operations. We rely on encryption and/or authentication technology licensed and, at times, administered by third parties to effect secure transmission of confidential information, including credit card numbers. Our outsource agreements with third-party service providers generally require that providers have adequate security systems in place to protect all of our customer transaction data. However, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other cyber-security developments could render our security systems and technology or those employed by our third-party service providers vulnerable to a breach. In addition, anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations. Cyber-security risks such as malicious software and attempts to gain unauthorized access to data are rapidly evolving and could lead to disruptions in our reservation system or other data systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information or corruption of data. Any successful efforts by individuals to infiltrate, break into, disrupt, damage or otherwise steal from the Company\u2019s, its licensees\u2019 or its third-party service providers\u2019 security or information systems could damage our reputation and brand and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability that could substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nWe may experience difficulties fully implementing our enterprise resource planning systems.\nWe have been engaged in a project to upgrade our enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) systems. Our ERP systems are critical to our ability to accurately maintain books and records, record transactions, provide important information to our management and prepare our financial statements. The implementation of the new ERP systems has required, and will continue to require, the investment of significant financial and human resources. In addition, we may not be able to successfully complete the full implementation of the ERP systems without experiencing difficulties. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of the new ERP systems could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business.\nThe failure of any banking institution in which we deposit our funds or the failure of such banking institution to provide services could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or access to borrowings.\nWe deposit our cash and cash equivalents with a number of financial institutions around the world. Should any of these financial institutions fail or otherwise be unable to timely perform requested services, we would likely have a limited ability to quickly access our cash deposited with such institutions. If we are unable to quickly access such funds, we may need to increase our use of our existing credit lines or access more expensive credit, if available. If we are unable to access some or all of our cash on deposit, either temporarily or permanently, or if we access existing or additional credit or are unable to access additional credit, it could have a negative impact on our operations, including our reported net income, our financial position, or both.\nWe have substantial debt and other financial obligations and we may incur even more debt.\nWe have substantial debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. On March 29, 2013, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement with Bank of America, as agent, and Bank of America and Brown Brothers Harriman & Co as lenders, as amended on October 31, 2013 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). As of December 31, 2014, we had borrowings of $21.5 million under the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement includes covenants relating to income, debt coverage and cash flow and minimum working capital requirements. The Credit Agreement also contains limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and requires lender approval for acquisitions funded with cash, promissory notes and/or other consideration in excess of $6.0 million and for acquisitions funded solely with equity in excess of $10.0 million. If we are not in compliance with certain of these covenants, in addition to other actions the creditor may require, the amounts drawn on the Credit Agreement may become immediately due and payable. This immediate payment may negatively impact our financial condition.\nWe have pledged substantially all of our assets (including the assets of our restricted subsidiaries) to secure our indebtedness. Our Credit Agreement and related obligations:\n\u00b7\nRequire us to dedicate significant cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes;\n\u00b7\nMay limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions or funding our strategic growth plan;\n\u00b7\nImpose on us additional financial and operational restrictions;\n\u00b7\nExpose us to interest rate risk since a portion of our debt obligations is at variable rates (which is mitigated to a certain extent, by interest rate hedging transactions we entered into in connection with our Credit Agreement); and\n\u00b7\nRestrict our ability to fund certain acquisitions.\nIn addition, investors may be apprehensive about investing in companies such as ours that carry a substantial amount of leverage on their balance sheets, and this apprehension may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nFailure to comply with the financial covenants, or any other non-financial or restrictive covenant, could create a default under our Credit Agreement. Upon a default, our lenders could accelerate the indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, foreclose against their collateral or seek other remedies, which would jeopardize our ability to continue our current operations. Such other remedies, and our response thereto, may involve a repatriation or use of our foreign cash balances that may be restricted by local laws or could have adverse tax consequences and substantially harm our business and results of operations. We may be required to amend our Credit Agreement, refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, incur additional indebtedness or raise equity. Further, based upon our actual performance levels, our covenants relating to income, debt coverage and cash flow and minimum working capital requirements could limit our ability to incur additional debt, which could hinder our ability to execute our current business strategy.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on our debt and other financial obligations and comply with financial covenants depends on our financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance will continue to be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nFailure to raise additional capital or generate the significant capital necessary to implement our acquisition strategy, expand our operations and invest in new products could reduce our ability to compete and result in less revenue.\nWe anticipate that our financial resources, which include available cash, cash generated from operations, and debt and equity capacity, will be sufficient to finance operations and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. However, this expectation is premised on the current operating plan, which may change as a result of many factors, including market acceptance of new products and future opportunities with collaborators. Consequently, we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated. In addition, our line of credit may not be sufficient to fund our acquisition strategy. In such case, our inability to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and in a timely manner (if at all) could seriously harm our business, product development, and acquisition efforts.\nIf we raise additional funds through the sale of equity or convertible debt or equity-linked securities, existing percentages of ownership in our common stock will be reduced. In addition, these transactions may dilute the value of our outstanding common stock. We may issue securities that have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock. If we raise additional funds through collaborations or licensing arrangements, we may relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products, or grant licenses to third parties on terms that are unfavorable. In addition, our Credit Agreement contains limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and requires lender approval for acquisitions funded with cash, promissory notes and/or other consideration in excess of $6.0 million and for acquisitions funded solely with equity in excess of $10.0 million. If future financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we may have to alter our operations or change our business strategy. We cannot assure you that the capital required to fund operations or our acquisition strategy will be available in the future.\nIf our spin-off of Harvard Apparatus Regenerative Technology, Inc., or HART, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could be subject to significant tax liability.\nOn June 28, 2013, we received a Supplemental Ruling to the Private Letter Ruling dated March 22, 2013, from the IRS to the effect that, among other things, the spin-off of HART will qualify as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code continuing in effect. The private letter and supplemental rulings and the tax opinion that we received from Burns & Levinson LLP, special counsel to Harvard Bioscience, Inc. rely on certain representations, assumptions and undertakings, including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business and HART\u2019s business, and neither the private letter and supplemental rulings nor the opinion would be valid if such representations, assumptions and undertakings were incorrect. Moreover, the private letter and supplemental rulings do not address all the issues that are relevant to determining whether the spin-off distribution will qualify for tax-free treatment. Notwithstanding the private letter and supplemental rulings and opinion, the IRS could determine the spin-off distribution should be treated as a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes if, among other reasons, it determines any of the representations, assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the private letter and supplemental rulings are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the IRS ruling.\nIf the spin-off distribution fails to qualify for tax-free treatment, in general, we would be subject to tax as if we had sold HART\u2019s common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and stockholders who receive shares of HART\u2019s common stock in the spin-off distribution would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of such shares.\nTo the extent we do not structure certain corporate transactions in compliance with the requirements of certain \u201csafe harbor\u201d provision of the internal revenue code, the tax rules applicable to a tax-free spin-off may limit our ability to engage in certain corporate transactions or raise equity capital beyond certain thresholds for a period of time after the spin-off of HART.\nCurrent U.S. federal income tax law creates a presumption that our spin-off of HART would be taxable to us, but not our stockholders, if such spin-off is part of a \u201cplan or series of related transactions\u201d pursuant to which one or more persons acquire directly or indirectly, stock representing a 50% or greater interest (by vote or value) in us or HART. Although acquisitions that occur during the four-year period that begins two years before the date of the spin-off are presumed to occur pursuant to a plan or series of related transactions, the U.S. Treasury regulations provide several \u201csafe harbors\u201d for acquisitions that would not be considered to be part of such a plan. Such regulations generally provide that whether an acquisition and a spin-off are part of a plan is determined based on all of the facts and circumstances, including, but not limited to, specific factors described in the U.S. Treasury regulations.\nTo the extent we acquire any businesses or engage in certain other corporate transactions during the two year period following the spin-off, we intend to structure such transactions in a manner that complies with the safe harbors provided by the U.S. Treasury regulations, however, the presumption that acquisitions will be part of a \u201cplan or series of related transactions\u201d may limit our ability during the two-year period following the spin-off to enter into certain transactions that may be advantageous to us and our stockholders, particularly, issuing equity securities to satisfy financing needs, repurchasing equity securities, disposing of certain assets, engaging in mergers and acquisitions, and, under certain circumstances, acquiring businesses or assets with equity securities or agreeing to be acquired.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment of the spin-off to us and our stockholders, under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with HART in connection with the spin-off, we are prohibited from taking or failing to take (or permitting any of our subsidiaries, other than HART and its subsidiaries, to take or fail to take) any action where such action or failure to act would prevent the tax-free nature of the spin-off or be inconsistent with any material, information, covenant or representation that relates to facts or matters related to Harvard Bioscience (or any of our subsidiaries, other than HART and its subsidiaries) or our business or within our control and is contained in any representation letter related to the private letter ruling, supplemental private letter ruling or tax opinion (or any other supplemental private letter ruling or tax opinion that may be necessary) mentioned above. These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions of a certain magnitude that involve the issuance or acquisition of our stock or engage in new businesses or other transactions that might increase the value of our business. These restrictions may also limit our ability to raise significant amounts of cash through the issuance of stock, especially if our stock price were to suffer substantial declines, or through the sale of certain of our assets.\nThird parties may seek to hold us responsible for HART\u2019s liabilities, including liabilities that HART has assumed from us.\nThird parties may seek to hold us responsible for HART\u2019s liabilities, including any of the liabilities that HART agreed to retain or assume in connection with the separation of the HART business from our businesses, and related spin-off distribution. Pursuant to our agreements with HART, HART has agreed to indemnify us for claims and losses relating to certain liabilities that it has assumed from us, including liabilities in connection with the sale of HART\u2019s products, intellectually property infringement and other liabilities related to the operation of HART\u2019s business. However, if those liabilities are significant and we are ultimately held liable for them, we cannot assure you that HART will have the ability to satisfy its obligations to us. If HART is unable to satisfy its obligations under its indemnity to us, we may have to satisfy these obligations, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nUnder accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d), we review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is also required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, future cash flows, and slower growth rates in our industry. We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets is determined, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAccounting for goodwill, other intangible assets and long-lived assets may have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe assess the recoverability of identifiable intangibles with finite lives and other long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASU\u201d) 360, \u201cProperty, Plant and Equipment\u201d. In accordance with FASB ASU 350, \u201cIntangibles-Goodwill and Other\u201d, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives from acquisitions are evaluated annually, or more frequently, if events or circumstances indicate there may be an impairment, to determine whether any portion of the remaining balance of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles may not be recoverable. If it is determined in the future that a portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets is impaired, we will be required to write off that portion of the asset according to the methods defined by FASB ASU 360 and FASB ASU 350, which could have an adverse effect on net income for the period in which the write-off occurs. At December 31, 2014, our continuing operations had goodwill and intangible assets of $62.2 million, or 46%, of our total assets and we concluded that none of our goodwill or other intangible assets was impaired.\nIf our accounting estimates are not correct, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nManagement judgment and estimates are required in the application of our Critical Accounting Policies. We discuss these estimates in the subsection entitled critical accounting policies beginning on page 27 in Item 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Annual Report. If our estimates are incorrect, our future financial operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to retain key personnel and hire, train and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to compete effectively, which could result in reduced revenue or increased costs.\nOur success is highly dependent on the continued services of key management, technical and scientific personnel. Our management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment at any time upon short notice. The loss of the services of any member of the senior management team, including the Chief Executive Officer, Jeffrey A. Duchemin, the Chief Financial Officer, Robert E. Gagnon, the Vice President Strategic Marketing and Business Development, Yong Sun, the Vice President of Global Sales, Yoav Sibony, or any of the managerial, technical or scientific staff may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of product development, our growth strategies and other business objectives. Our future success will also depend on our ability to identify, recruit and retain additional qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel. We operate in several geographic locations where labor markets are particularly competitive, including Boston, Massachusetts, the New York metropolitan area, London and Cambridge, England, where demand for personnel with these skills is extremely high and is likely to remain high. As a result, competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly in the areas of general management, finance, information technology, engineering and science, and the process of hiring suitably qualified personnel is often lengthy and expensive, and may become more expensive in the future. If we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, our ability to conduct and expand our business could be seriously reduced.\nRising commodity and precious metals costs could adversely impact our profitability.\nRaw material commodities such as resins, and precious metal commodities such as platinum are subject to wide price variations. Increases in the costs and availability of these commodities and the costs of energy, transportation and other necessary services may adversely affect our profit margins if we are unable to pass along any higher costs in the form of price increases or otherwise achieve cost efficiencies such as in manufacturing and distribution.\nIf we are unable to effectively protect our intellectual property, third parties may use our technology, which would impair our ability to compete in our markets.\nOur continued success will depend in significant part on our ability to obtain and maintain meaningful patent protection for certain of our products throughout the world. Patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain. We also own numerous U.S. registered trademarks and trade names and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending. We rely on patents to protect a significant part of our intellectual property and to enhance our competitive position. However, our presently pending or future patent applications may not be accepted and patents might not be issued, and any patent previously issued to us may be challenged, invalidated, held unenforceable or circumvented. Furthermore, the claims in patents which have been issued or which may be issued to us in the future may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar to our products. In addition, the laws of various foreign countries in which we compete may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent, as do the laws of the United States. If we fail to obtain adequate patent protection for our proprietary technology, our ability to be commercially competitive could be materially impaired.\nIn addition to patent protection, we also rely on protection of trade secrets, know-how and confidential and proprietary information. To maintain the confidentiality of trade-secrets and proprietary information, we generally seek to enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic partners upon the commencement of a relationship. However, we may not be able to obtain these agreements in all circumstances in part due to local regulations. In the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of this information, these agreements, even if obtained, may not provide meaningful protection for our trade-secrets or other confidential information. In addition, adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of this information. The loss or exposure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and future growth prospects.\nThe manufacture, sale and use of products and services may expose us to product liability claims for which we could have substantial liability.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims if our products, services or product candidates, including without limitation, any of our life science research tools are alleged or found to have caused injury, damage or loss. We may in the future be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we can obtain. If we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage, then our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents that would be expensive and time-consuming.\nIn order to protect or enforce our patent rights, we may initiate patent litigation against third parties. We may also become subject to interference proceedings conducted in the patent and trademark offices of various countries to determine the priority of inventions. Several of our products are based on patents that are closely surrounded by patents held by competitors or potential competitors. As a result, we believe there is a greater likelihood of a patent dispute than would be expected if our patents were not closely surrounded by other patents. The defense and prosecution, if necessary, of intellectual property suits, interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings would be costly and divert our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. We may not prevail in any of these suits should they occur. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of being rejected and no patents being issued.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. For example, during the course of this kind of litigation, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation. Securities analysts or investors may perceive these announcements to be negative, which could cause the market price of our stock to decline.\nOur success will depend partly on our ability to operate without infringing on or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of others.\nWe may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others, including the patent rights, trademarks and trade names of third parties. In 2013, we received correspondence from legal counsel to Nanofiber Solutions, Inc., or NFS, claiming that in developing the scaffold product and related intellectual property now owned and being developed by HART, we may have committed misappropriation, unauthorized use and disclosure of confidential information, and possible infringement of intellectual property rights of NFS. Intellectual property litigation is costly and the outcome is uncertain. If we do not prevail in any intellectual property litigation, in addition to any damages we might have to pay, we could be required to stop the infringing activity, or obtain a license to or design around the intellectual property in question. If we are unable to obtain a required license on acceptable terms, or are unable to design around any third party patent, we may be unable to sell some of our products and services, which could result in reduced revenue.\nEthical concerns surrounding the use of our products and misunderstanding of the nature of our business could adversely affect our ability to develop and sell our existing products and new products.\nSome of our products may be used in areas of research usage involving animal research and other techniques presently being explored in the life science industry. These techniques have drawn negative attention in the public forum. Government authorities may regulate or prohibit any of these activities. Additionally, the public may disfavor or reject these activities.\nNew regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses and otherwise adversely impact our business.\nThe SEC has promulgated final rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act regarding disclosure of the use of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, known as conflict minerals, in products manufactured by public companies. These new rules require ongoing due diligence to determine whether such minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of Congo (the DRC) or an adjoining country and whether such minerals helped finance the armed conflict in the DRC. Reporting obligations for the rule began on May 31, 2014 and are required annually thereafter. There will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs to determine the origin of conflict minerals in our products. The implementation of these rules and their effect on customer, supplier and/or consumer behavior could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. As a result, we may also incur costs with respect to potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply. We may face disqualification as a supplier for customers and reputational challenges if the due diligence procedures we implement do not enable us to verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products, including that such minerals did not originate from any of the covered conflict countries. Accordingly, the implementation of these rules could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nOur stock price has fluctuated in the past and could experience substantial declines in the future.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may become volatile and could decline in the future, perhaps substantially, in response to various factors including:\n\u00b7\nvolatility of the financial markets;\n\u00b7\nuncertainty regarding the prospects of the domestic and foreign economies;\n\u00b7\nfailure to achieve our desired tax treatment of the separation and spin-off of HART;\n\u00b7\ntechnological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies;\n\u00b7\nrevenues and operating results fluctuating or failing to meet the expectations of management, securities analysts, or investors in any quarter;\n\u00b7\ncomments of securities analysts and mistakes by or misinterpretation of comments from analysts, downward revisions in securities analysts\u2019 estimates or management guidance;\n\u00b7\ninvestment banks and securities analysts becoming subject to lawsuits that may adversely affect the perception of the market;\n\u00b7\nconditions or trends in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of significant acquisitions or financings or strategic partnerships;\n\u00b7\nnon-compliance with the internal control standards pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and\n\u00b7\na decrease in the demand for our common stock.\nIn addition, public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volatility. The stock market and the NASDAQ Global Market in general, and the biotechnology industry and small cap markets in particular, have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that at times may have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may further harm the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs, potential liabilities and the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nProvisions of Delaware law, of our charter and bylaws and our Shareholder Rights Plan may make a takeover more difficult, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in the Delaware corporate law may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt, which is opposed by management and the board of directors. Public stockholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have an opportunity to do so. In February 2008, our Board of Directors adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring, the Company or a large block of our common stock. A third party that acquires 20% or more of our common stock (an \u201cAcquiring Person\u201d) could suffer substantial dilution of its ownership interest under the terms of the Shareholder Rights Plan through the issuance of common stock to all shareholders other than the Acquiring Person. We also have a staggered board of directors that makes it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the board of directors in any one year. These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to change our management and board of directors. Such provisions may also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nAlthough our common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market, an active trading market for the shares may not be sustained. This could negatively affect the price for our common stock, including investors\u2019 ability to buy or sell our common stock and the listing thereof.\nAny issuance of preferred stock in the future may dilute the rights of our common stockholders.\nOur board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, privileges and other terms of these shares. The board of directors may exercise this authority without any further approval of stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock may be adversely affected by the rights of future holders of preferred stock.\nCash dividends will not likely be paid on our common stock.\nCurrently, we intend to retain all of our earnings to finance the expansion and development of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the near future. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be a stockholder\u2019s sole source of gain for the near future.", "PERMNO": 88839, "SIC": 3826, "TIC": "HBIO"}
