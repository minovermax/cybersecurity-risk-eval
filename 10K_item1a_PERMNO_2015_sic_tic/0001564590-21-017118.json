Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this report on Form 10-K, including the section of this report titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and our financial statements and related notes. If any of the events described in the following risk factors and the risks described elsewhere in this report occurs, our business, operating results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. This report on Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of factors that are described below and elsewhere in this report.\nRisks Related to Our Hemp Business\nWe will be subject to a myriad of different laws and regulations governing hemp and our inability to comply with such laws in a cost-effective manner may have an adverse effect on our business and result of operations.\nLaws and regulations governing the use of hemp in the United States are broad in scope, subject to evolving interpretations, and subject to enforcement by a myriad of regulatory agencies and law enforcement entities. Under the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, also known as the 2018 Farm Bill, a state or Indian tribe that desires to have primary regulatory authority over the production of hemp in the state or territory of the Indian tribe must submit a plan to monitor and regulate hemp production to the Secretary of the USDA. The Secretary must then approve the state or tribal plan after determining if the plan complies with the requirements set forth in the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018. The Secretary may also audit the state or Indian tribe\u2019s compliance with the federally-approved plan. If the Secretary does not approve the state or Indian tribe\u2019s plan, then the production of hemp in that state or territory of that Indian tribe will be subject to a plan established by USDA. USDA published a final rule on January 19, 2021, that provided regulations for the production of hemp in the USA that went into effect on March 22, 2021. We anticipate that some states will seek to have primary regulatory authority over the production of hemp. States that seek such authority may create new laws and regulations that limit or restrict the use of hemp.\nFederal and state laws and regulations on hemp may address production, monitoring, manufacturing, distribution, and laboratory testing to ensure that that the hemp has a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3% on a dry weight basis. Federal laws and regulations may also address the transportation or shipment of hemp or hemp products, as the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 prohibits states and Indian tribes from prohibiting the transportation or shipment of hemp or hemp products produced in accordance with that law through the state or territory of the Indian tribe, as applicable. We may be subject to many different state-based regulatory regimens for hemp, all of which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance requirements. Our research and development operations will be restricted to only where such operations are legal on the local, state and federal levels.\nThe DEA issued an interim final rule to codify statutory amendments to the controlled substances act made by the 2018 farm bill. It is possible that the DEA will make additional changes in a final rule that may have a material impact on our hemp business and our ability to operate.\nThe Food and Drug Administration has published guidance related to the CBD and hemp-extract business but has not formally released a regulatory framework for the industry. It is possible that the FDA will provide additional guidance or implement future regulations that may have a material impact on our hemp business.\nIn addition, it is possible that additional regulations may be enacted in the future in the United States and globally that will be directly applicable to our research and development operations. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business.\nWe may be forced to dispose of hemp we produce should a harvested crop test in excess of 0.3% THC levels.\nThe USDA\u2019s Final Rule for hemp cultivation mandates that states test hemp crops and dispose of \"hot\" crops that exceed 0.3% THC. If a producer has produced cannabis exceeding the acceptable hemp THC level, the material must be disposed of in accordance with USDA regulations. Arcadia is responsible for the costs of disposal of non-compliant crops for which it is the producer, which could potentially be significant should a large number of acres test positive.\nThere is limited operating history in the legal hemp or cannabis industry, which makes it difficult to accurately assess our future growth prospects.\nThe legal hemp and cannabis industry is an evolving industry that may not develop as expected. Furthermore, our operations continue to evolve as we continually assess new strategic opportunities for our business within this industry. Assessing the future prospects of this industry is challenging in light of both known and unknown risks and difficulties we may encounter. Growth prospects in the legal hemp and cannabis industry can be affected by a wide variety of factors including:\n\u2022\nCompetition from other similar companies;\n\u2022\nFluctuations in the market price of hemp seeds and CBD oil;\n\u2022\nRegulatory limitations on the types of research and development with respect to cannabis;\n\u2022\nOther changes in the regulation of cannabis and legal hemp use; and\n\u2022\nChanges in underlying consumer behavior, which may affect the demand of our legal hemp and cannabis traits.\nWe may not be able to successfully address the above factors, which could negatively impact our intended business plans and financial statements.\nBecause we have only recently begun our legal hemp operations, we anticipate our operating expenses will increase prior to earning meaningful revenue from these operations.\nAs we execute our business plan with respect to legal hemp, we anticipate significant increases in our operating and production expenses, and we may not realize significant revenues from such operations. As a result, the Company may incur significant financial losses with respect to such operations in the foreseeable future. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that these operations will prove successful.\nNegative press from being in the hemp/cannabis space could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe hemp plant and the cannabis/marijuana plant are both part of the same cannabis sativa genus/species of plant, except that hemp, by definition, has less than 0.3% THC content, but the same plant with a higher THC content is cannabis/marijuana, which is legal under certain state laws, but which is not legal under federal law. The similarities between these plants can cause confusion, and our activities with legal hemp may be incorrectly perceived as us being involved in federally illegal cannabis. Also, despite growing support for the cannabis industry and legalization of cannabis in certain U.S. states, many individuals and businesses remain opposed to the cannabis industry. Any negative press resulting from any incorrect perception that we have entered into the cannabis space could result in a loss of current or future business. It could also adversely affect the public\u2019s perception of us and lead to reluctance by new parties to do business with us or to own our common stock. We cannot assure you that additional business partners, including but not limited to financial institutions and customers, will not attempt to end or curtail their relationships with us. Any such negative press or cessation of business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Other Industries\nUnfavorable global economic or political conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. A global financial crisis or a global or regional political disruption could cause extreme volatility in the capital and credit markets. For example, outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic, or contagious diseases, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, could disrupt our business. Business disruptions could include disruptions to the productivity of our employees working remotely and restrictions on their travel may hinder their ability to meet with potential customers and close transactions, as well as temporary closures of the facilities of suppliers or contract growers in our supply chain. While we\u2019ve seen very recent signs of improvement, hemp growers have been slower to make decisions to purchase hemp seeds due to economic uncertainty and wheat consumer packaged goods companies have been heavily focused on production over R&D evaluation as demand for staples like pasta and flour have increased. In addition, the COVID-19 outbreak may result in a severe economic downturn and has already significantly affected the financial markets of many countries. A severe or prolonged economic downturn or political disruption could result in a variety of risks to our business, including our ability to raise capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy or political disruption could also strain our manufacturers or suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause our customers to delay making payments for our services. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the political or economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nWe or our partners may not be successful in developing commercial products that incorporate our traits and for which there is consumer demand.\nOur future growth depends on our ability to monetize the trait assets we\u2019ve created by bringing products to market that incorporate our technology, as well as licensing these traits to our collaborators to develop and commercialize seeds and products that contain our traits. The development process could take longer than we anticipate or could ultimately fail to achieve commercial success for any of the following reasons, including but not limited to: non-competitive pricing, ineffective advertising and marketing campaigns, increased competition, failure to align with consumer tastes and lack of brand acceptance.\nIf products containing our traits are never commercialized or are not well-received in the marketplace, our ability to generate revenues and become profitable, as well as our long-term growth strategy, would be materially and adversely affected. Even if we or our collaborators are able to develop commercial products that incorporate our traits, any such products may not achieve commercial success as quickly as we project, or at all.\nWe have a history of significant losses, which we expect to continue, and we may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have incurred significant net losses since our formation in 2002 and expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future. We incurred net losses of $6.0 million, and $28.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $211.8 million. Net cash used in operations was $30.2 million and $17.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect to continue to incur losses. Because we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs and expenses for these efforts before we obtain any incremental revenues from the sale of seeds or products incorporating our traits, our losses in future periods could be even more significant. In addition, we may find our development and commercialization efforts are more expensive than we anticipate or that they do not generate revenues in the time period we anticipate, which would further increase our losses. If we are unable to adequately control the costs associated with operating our business, including costs of development and commercialization of our traits, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects will suffer.\nWe may require additional financing and may not be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms, if at all, which could force us to delay, reduce, or eliminate our research and development activities.\nWe will continue to need capital to fund our development projects, the commercialization of our products, and to provide working capital to fund other aspects of our business. If our capital resources are insufficient to meet our capital requirements, we will have to raise additional funds. If future financings involve the issuance of equity securities, our existing stockholders would suffer dilution. If we are able to raise debt financing, we may be subject to restrictive covenants that limit our operating flexibility. We may not be able to raise sufficient additional funds on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. If we fail to raise sufficient funds and continue to incur losses, our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of strategic opportunities, develop and commercialize products or technologies, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited. If this happens, we may be forced to delay or terminate research and development programs or the commercialization of products or curtail operations. If adequate funds are not available, we will not be able to successfully execute on our business strategy or continue our business.\nOur gross profit margins on the products we\u2019ve recently introduced containing our GoodWheat as an ingredient may be impacted by a variety of factors, including but not limited to, variations in raw materials and packaging pricing, customer requirements, market acceptance rate and promotional support costs.\nWe expect that our gross profit as a percentage of net sales could fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including product pricing, retail discounts, and the availability and cost of ingredients and packaging. In addition, our gross profit margin may be impacted by shifts in the overall mix of products having a higher or lower profit margin. If we are not able to increase our selling prices or reduce product sizes sufficiently, or in a timely manner, to offset increased raw material, packaging, or other input costs, or if our sales volume decreases significantly, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Should the rate of market acceptance of our products be slower than anticipated, we may incur additional expense by increasing promotional activities.\nCompetition in traits and seeds is intense and requires continuous technological development, and, if we are unable to compete effectively, our financial results will suffer.\nWe face significant competition in the markets in which we operate. The markets for traits and agricultural biotechnology products are intensely competitive and rapidly changing. In most segments of the seed and agricultural biotechnology market, the number of products available to consumers is steadily increasing as new products are introduced. At the same time, the expiration of patents covering existing products reduces the barriers to entry for competitors. We may be unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors, which may result in price reductions, reduced margins and the inability to achieve market acceptance for products containing our traits. In addition, several of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, sales, distribution, research and development, and technical resources than us, and some of our collaborators have more experience in research and development, regulatory matters, manufacturing, and marketing. We anticipate increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market and new technologies become available. Our technologies may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors, which will prevent or limit our ability to generate revenues from the commercialization of our traits being developed.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct, monitor, support, and oversee field trials and commercial production and, in some cases, to maintain regulatory files for those products in development, and any performance issues by third parties, or our inability to engage third parties on acceptable terms, may impact our or our collaborators\u2019 ability to complete the regulatory process for or commercialize such products.\nWe rely on third parties, including farmers, to conduct, monitor, support, and oversee field trials and commercial production. As a result, we have less control over the timing and cost of these activities than if we conducted them with our own personnel. If we are unable to maintain or enter into agreements with these third parties on acceptable terms, or if any such engagement is terminated prematurely, we may be unable to conduct and complete our trials and commercial production in the manner we anticipate. In addition, there is no guarantee that these third parties will devote adequate time and resources to our activities or perform as required by our contract or in accordance with regulatory requirements, including maintenance of field trial or production information. If these third parties fail to meet expected deadlines, fail to transfer to us any regulatory or other information in a timely manner, fail to adhere to protocols, or fail to act in accordance with regulatory requirements or our agreements with them, or if they otherwise perform in a substandard manner or in a way that compromises the quality or accuracy of their activities or the data they obtain, then field trials and commercial production of our products in development may be extended or delayed with additional costs incurred, or our data may be rejected by the USDA or FDA, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, or other regulatory agencies. Ultimately, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our field trials and commercial production is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our responsibilities.\nIf our relationship with any of these third parties is terminated, we may be unable to enter into arrangements with alternative parties on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Switching or adding growers or other suppliers can involve substantial cost and require extensive management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new farmer or other third party commences work. As a result, delays may occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired development or commercial timelines. If we are required to seek alternative supply arrangements, the resulting delays and potential inability to find a suitable replacement could materially and adversely impact our business.\nMost of our collaborators have significant resources and development capabilities and may develop their own products that compete with or negatively impact the advancement or sale of products containing our traits.\nMost of our collaborators are significantly larger than us and may have substantially greater resources and development capabilities. As a result, we are subject to competition from many of our collaborators, who could develop or pursue competing products and traits that may ultimately prove more commercially viable than our traits. In addition, former collaborators, by virtue of having had access to our proprietary technology, may utilize this insight for their own development efforts, despite the fact that our collaboration agreements prohibit such use. The development or launch of a competing product by a collaborator may adversely affect the advancement and commercialization of any traits we develop and any associated research and development and milestone payments and value-sharing payments we receive from the sale of products containing our traits.\nOur joint venture agreements could present a number of challenges that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur joint venture arrangements may present financial, managerial, and operational challenges, including potential disputes, liabilities, or contingencies and may involve risks not otherwise present when operating independently, including:\n\u2022\nour joint venture partners may have business interests, goals or cultures that are or become inconsistent with our business interests, goals or culture\u037e\n\u2022\nour joint venture partners may share certain approval rights,\n\u2022\nwe may incur liabilities or losses as a result of an action taken by the joint venture or our joint venture partners\u037e\n\u2022\nour joint venture partners may take action contrary to our instructions, requests, policies or objectives, which could reduce our return on investment, harm our reputation or restrict our ability to run our business\u037e and\n\u2022\ndisputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in delays, litigation or operational impasses.\nThe risks described above or the failure to continue any joint venture or joint development arrangement or to resolve disagreements with our current or future joint venture partners could materially and adversely affect our ability to transact the business that is the subject of such joint venture, which would in turn negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and our collaborators may disagree over our right to receive payments under our collaboration agreements, potentially resulting in costly litigation and loss of reputation.\nOur ability to receive payments under our collaboration agreements depends on our ability to clearly delineate our rights under those agreements. We typically license our intellectual property to our collaborators, who then develop and commercialize seeds with improved traits. However, a collaborator may use our intellectual property without our permission, dispute our ownership of certain intellectual property rights, or argue that our intellectual property does not cover, or add value to, their marketed product. If a dispute arises, it may result in costly patent office procedures and litigation, and our collaborator may refuse to pay us while the dispute is ongoing. Furthermore, regardless of any resort to legal action, a dispute with a collaborator over intellectual property rights may damage our relationship with that collaborator and may also harm our reputation in the industry.\nEven if we are entitled to payments from our collaborators, we may not actually receive these payments, or we may experience difficulties in collecting the payments to which we believe we are entitled. After our collaborators launch commercial products containing our licensed traits, we will need to rely on the good faith of our collaborators to report to us the sales they earn from these products and to accurately calculate the payments we are entitled to, a process that will involve complicated and difficult calculations. Although we seek to address these concerns in our collaboration agreements by reserving our right to audit financial records, such provisions may not be effective.\nOur business is subject to various government regulations and if we or our collaborators are unable to timely complete the regulatory process for our products in development, our or our collaborators\u2019 ability to market our traits could be delayed, prevented or limited.\nOur business is generally subject to two types of regulations: regulations that apply to how we and our collaborators operate and regulations that apply to products containing our traits. We apply for and maintain the regulatory permits necessary for our operations, particularly those covering our hemp seed breeding, seed production, and crop production operations or field trials, while we or our collaborators apply for and maintain regulatory approvals necessary for the commercialization of products containing our seed traits. The large-scale field trials that our collaborators conduct during advanced stages of product development are subject to regulations similar to those to which we are subject. Even if we and our collaborators make timely and appropriate applications for regulatory permits for our field trials, government delays in issuing such permits can significantly affect the development timelines for our products, particularly if the planting period for a crop growing season expires before the necessary permits are obtained. Pursuant to our collaboration agreements, our collaborators also apply for the requisite regulatory approvals prior to commercialization of products containing our traits. In most of our key target markets, regulatory approvals must be received prior to the importation of genetically modified products. These regulatory processes may be complex\u037e for example, the U.S. federal government\u2019s regulation of biotechnology is divided among the EPA, which regulates activity related to the use of plant pesticides and herbicides, the USDA, which regulates the import, field testing, interstate movement, and environmental release of specific technologies that may be used in the creation of genetically modified plants, and the FDA, which regulates foods derived from new plant varieties.\nIn addition to regulation by the U.S. government, products containing our biotech traits may be subject to regulation in each country in which such products are tested or sold. International regulations may vary from country to country and from those of the United States. The difference in regulations under U.S. law and the laws of foreign countries may be significant and, in order to comply with the laws of foreign countries, we may have to implement global changes to our products or business practices. Such changes may result in additional expense to us and either reduce or delay product development or sales. Additionally, we or our collaborators may be required to obtain certifications or approvals by foreign governments to test and sell the products in foreign countries.\nThe regulatory process is expensive and time-consuming, and the time required to complete the process is difficult to predict and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. Our traits could require a significantly longer time to complete the regulatory process than expected, or may never gain approval, even if we and our collaborators expend substantial time and resources seeking such approval. A delay or denial of regulatory approval could delay or prevent our ability to generate revenues and to achieve profitability. Changes in regulatory review policies during the development period of any of our traits, changes in, or the enactment of, additional regulations or statutes, or changes in regulatory review practices for a submitted product application may cause a delay in obtaining approval or result in the rejection of an application for regulatory approval. Regulatory approval, if obtained, may be made subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we or our collaborators may market a product. These limitations could adversely affect our potential revenues. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may, among other things, result in fines, suspensions of regulatory approvals, product recalls, product seizures, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecution. We have on certain occasions notified the USDA of instances of noncompliance with regulations. Although these occasions did not result in any enforcement actions, we may have occasions of noncompliance in the future that result in USDA or other governmental agency enforcement action.\nLoss of or damage to our germplasm collection would significantly slow our product development efforts.\nWe have developed and maintain a comprehensive collection of germplasm through strategic collaborations with leading institutions, which we utilize in our non-GM programs. Germplasm comprises collections of genetic resources covering the diversity of a crop, the attributes of which are inherited from generation to generation. Germplasm is a key strategic asset since it forms the basis of seed development programs. To the extent that we lose access to such germplasm because of the termination or breach of our collaboration agreements, our product development capabilities would be severely limited. In addition, loss of or damage to these germplasm collections would significantly impair our research and development activities. Although we restrict access to our germplasm at our research facilities to protect this valuable resource, we cannot guarantee that our efforts to protect our germplasm collection will be successful. The destruction or theft of a significant portion of our germplasm collection would adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe regulatory environment outside the United States varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and there is less certainty how some of our products will be regulated.\nWe may use gene-editing and TILLING technology to develop some of our product portfolio. The regulatory environment around gene-editing and TILLING in plants for food ingredients is greatly uncertain outside of the United States and varies greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Each jurisdiction may have its own regulatory framework regarding genetically modified foods, which may include restrictions and regulations on planting and growing genetically modified plants and in the consumption and labeling of genetically modified foods, and which may encapsulate our products. To the extent regulatory frameworks outside of the United States are not receptive to our gene-editing and TILLING technologies, this may limit our ability to expand into other global markets.\nComplying with the regulatory requirements outside the United States will be costly and time-consuming, and there is no guarantee we will be able to commercialize our products outside the United States.\nWe cannot predict whether or when any jurisdiction will change its regulations with respect to our products. Advocacy groups have engaged in publicity campaigns and filed lawsuits in various countries against companies and regulatory authorities, seeking to halt regulatory approval or clearance activities or influence public opinion against genetically engineered and/or gene-edited products. In addition, governmental reaction to negative publicity concerning our products could result in greater regulation of genetic research and derivative products or regulatory costs that render our products cost prohibitive.\nThe scale of the commodity food industry may make it difficult to monitor and control the distribution of our products. As a result, our products may be sold inadvertently within jurisdictions where they are not approved for distribution. Such sales may lead to regulatory challenges or lawsuits against us, which could result in significant expenses and management attention.\nWe depend on our key personnel and, if we are not able to attract and retain qualified scientific and business personnel, we may not be able to grow our business or develop and commercialize our products.\nOur future performance depends on the continued services and contributions of our management team and other key employees, the loss of whose services might significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our scientific or business objectives. The replacement of any member of our management team involves significant time and costs and such loss could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives. A member of our leadership team who has been our employee for many years and therefore, has significant experience and understanding of our business, would be difficult to replace.\nAdditionally, the majority of our workforce is involved in development and commercial activities. Our business is therefore dependent on our ability to recruit and maintain a highly skilled and educated workforce with expertise in a range of disciplines, including plant genetics, agronomics, agribusiness, marketing, and other subjects relevant to our operations. All of our current employees are at-will employees, and the failure to retain or hire skilled and highly educated personnel could limit our growth and hinder our research and development efforts.\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, flood, crop losses, epidemics, and other catastrophic natural events, and security breaches, including cybersecurity incidents.\nOur headquarters, certain research and development operations and our seed storage warehouse are located in Davis, California. Production of hemp and wheat is conducted in California, Hawaii, Oregon, Idaho and other locations. Our seed, grain and hemp crops are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, including windstorms, floods, drought and temperature extremes, which are common but difficult to predict. In addition, the crops are vulnerable to crop disease and to pests, which may vary in severity and effect, depending on the stage of production at the time of infection or infestation, the type of treatment applied and climatic conditions. Unfavorable growing conditions can reduce both crop size and quality. Weather conditions, disease or pest infestation could damage the crop in spite of precautions we would normally take to avoid such losses. Our SONOVA product inventory is stored in a single cold storage facility in Northern California. We take precautions to safeguard our facilities, including insurance, health and safety protocols, and off-site storage of critical research results and computer data. However, a natural disaster, such as a fire, flood, or earthquake, could cause substantial delays in our operations, damage or destroy our equipment, inventory, or development projects, and cause us to incur additional expenses. The insurance we maintain against natural disasters may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case.\nWe utilize and critically rely upon information technology systems in all aspects of our business, including increasingly large amounts of data to support our products and advance our research and development. Failure to effectively prevent, detect, and recover from the increasing number and sophistication of information security threats could result in theft, misuse, modification, and destruction of information, including trade secrets and confidential business information, and cause business disruptions, delays in research and development, and reputational damage, which could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nA lack of availability of water in any of our production areas could impact our business.\nAdequate quantities and correct timing of the application of water are vital for most agriculture to thrive. Whether particular farms are experiencing water shortages depends, in large part, on their location. However, continuing drought conditions can threaten all farmland other than those properties with their own water sources. Domestic regulations regarding water usage and rights may also limit the availability of water. Moreover, if the farmers and others who purchase our seed to grow crops cannot get an adequate supply of water, or if the cost of water makes it uneconomical for the farmers to grow the crops, we may not be able to sell our seed, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur use of hazardous materials exposes us to potential liabilities.\nCertain of our operations involve the storage and controlled use of hazardous materials, including laboratory chemicals, herbicides, and pesticides. This requires us to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable environmental and safety standards, and we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination from hazardous materials. In the event of such contamination, we may be held liable for significant damages or fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nMost of the licenses we grant to our collaborators to use our proprietary genes in certain crops are exclusive within certain jurisdictions, which limits our licensing opportunities.\nMost of the licenses we grant our collaborators to use our proprietary genes in certain crops are exclusive within specified jurisdictions, so long as our collaborators comply with certain diligence requirements. That means that once genes are licensed to a collaborator in a specified crop or crops, we are generally prohibited from licensing those genes to any third party. The limitations imposed by these exclusive licenses could prevent us from expanding our business and increasing our product development initiatives with new collaborators, both of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risk of becoming an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nOn November 12, 2020, we acquired 1,875,000 shares of common stock of Bioceres Crop Solutions Corp. (\u201cBiox Shares\u201d) in connection with the sale of our membership interest in Verdeca to Bioceres, Inc. and our licensing of certain technology to Bioceres Inc. Our ownership of the Biox Shares could subject us to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d).\nSection 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that \u201cis engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities, and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer\u2019s total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items)\u201d (the \u201c40% Threshold\u201d). While we do not intend to engage primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in investment securities, the value of the Biox Shares relative to our other assets could change over time and cause us to exceed the 40% Threshold. Rule 3a-2 under the Investment Company Act provides one-year relief from the registration requirements of the Investment Company Act to an issuer that, on a transient basis, is deemed to be an investment company. The transient investment company exemption is available to a company no more than once every three years. If we exceed the 40% Threshold because our ownership of the Biox Shares, we will need to dispose of a sufficient amount of the Bios Shares in order to Company with the Investment Company act. Such disposal of the Biox Shares may be on terms that are unfavorable to us and could adversely impact our financial position and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to comply with Rule 3a-2 and are deemed to be an investment company, the consequences of failing to register under the Investment Company Act would be significant. For example, investment companies that fail to register under the Investment Company Act are prohibited from conducting business in interstate commerce. The ramifications of registering as an investment company, both in terms of the restrictions imposed on us and the cost of compliance, would be significant. For example, in addition to expenses related to initially registering as an investment company, the Investment Company Act also would impose various restrictions with regard to our ability to enter into affiliated transactions, the diversification of our assets, and our ability to borrow money. If we became subject to the Investment Company Act at some point in the future, our ability to continue pursuing our business plan would be severely limited.\nOur ownership of the Biox Shares could cause the value of our assets and our results of operation to vary significantly.\nThe value of the Biox Shares on our balance sheet will be based upon the market value of the Biox Shares as of the end of each quarter. As the Biox Shares trade on the NYSE American stock exchange, their value is subject to fluctuation over time. This fluctuation could be significant, which would materially affect our total assets and results of operations from quarter to quarter, independent of the performance of our core business.\nOur commercial success depends on our ability to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technologies and on the ability to operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection both in the United States and in other countries for any products we successfully develop. The patents and patent applications in our patent portfolio are either owned by us, exclusively licensed to us, or co-owned by us and others and exclusively licensed to us. Our ability to protect any products we successfully develop from unauthorized or infringing use by third parties depends substantially on our ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents. Due to evolving legal standards relating to the patentability, validity and enforceability of patents covering biotechnology inventions and the scope of claims made under these patents, our ability to obtain and enforce patents is uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Accordingly, rights under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection for any products we successfully develop or provide sufficient protection to afford us a commercial advantage against our competitors or their competitive products or processes. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any patents will be issued from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. Even if patents have been issued or will be issued, we cannot guarantee that the claims of these patents are, or will be, valid or enforceable, or provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable to us.\nThe U.S. Congress passed the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, which was signed into law in September 2011. The America Invents Act reforms U.S. patent law in part by changing the standard for patent approval from a \u201cfirst to invent\u201d standard to a \u201cfirst inventor to file\u201d standard and developing a post-grant review system. This new legislation affects U.S. patent law in a manner that may impact our ability to obtain or maintain patent protection for current or future inventions in the U.S. or otherwise cause uncertainty as to our patent protection.\nWe may not have identified all patents, published applications or published literature that may affect our business, either by blocking our ability to commercialize our traits, by preventing the patentability of our traits by us, our licensors or co-owners, or by covering the same or similar technologies that may invalidate our patents, limiting the scope of our future patent claims or adversely affecting our ability to market our products. For example, patent applications are maintained in confidence for at least 18 months after their filing. In some cases, patent applications remain confidential in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) for the entire time prior to issuance of a U.S. patent. Patent applications filed in countries outside the United States are not typically published until at least 18 months from their first filing date. Similarly, publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we or our licensors or co-owners were the first to invent, or the first inventors to file, patent applications on our processes, products or their uses. In the event that another party has filed a U.S. patent application covering the same invention as one of our patent applications or patents, we may have to participate in an adversarial proceeding, known as an interference, declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention in the United States.\nIf we or one of our collaborators are sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of a third party, such litigation could be costly and time consuming and could prevent us or our collaborators from developing or commercializing our products.\nOur ability to generate significant revenues from our products depends on our and our collaborators\u2019 ability to develop, market and sell our products and utilize our proprietary technology without infringing the intellectual property and other rights of any third parties. In the United States and abroad there are numerous third-party patents and patent applications that may be applied toward our proprietary technology, business processes, or developed traits, some of which may be construed as containing claims that cover the subject matter of our products or intellectual property. Because of the rapid pace of technological change, the confidentiality of patent applications in some jurisdictions (including U.S. provisional patent applications), and the fact that patent applications can take\nmany years to issue, there may be currently pending applications that are unknown to us that may later result in issued patents upon which our products in development or proprietary technologies infringe. Similarly, there may be issued patents relevant to our products in development of which we are not aware. These patents could reduce the value of the traits we develop or the plants containing our traits or, to the extent they cover key technologies on which we have unknowingly relied, require that we seek to obtain licenses or cease using the technology, no matter how valuable to our business. We may not be able to obtain such a license on commercially reasonable terms. If any third-party patent or patent application covers our intellectual property or proprietary rights and we are not able to obtain a license to it, we and our collaborators may be prevented from commercializing products containing our traits.\nAs the agricultural biotechnology industry continues to develop, we may become party to, or threatened with, litigation or other adverse proceedings regarding intellectual property or proprietary rights in our technology, processes, or developed traits. Third parties may assert claims based on existing or future intellectual property rights and the outcome of any proceedings is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance. Any litigation proceedings could be costly and time consuming, and negative outcomes could result in liability for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent. There is also no guarantee that we would be able to obtain a license under such infringed intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms or at all. A finding of infringement could prevent us or our collaborators from developing, marketing or selling a product or force us to cease some or all of our business operations. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel may be diverted as a result of these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could similarly have a negative impact on our business.\nOur success will depend in part on our ability to uphold and enforce patents or patent applications owned or co-owned by us or licensed to us, which cover products we successfully develop. Proceedings involving our patents or patent applications could result in adverse decisions regarding:\n\u2022\nownership of patents and patent applications;\n\u2022\nrights concerning licenses;\n\u2022\nthe patentability of our inventions relating to our products; and/or\n\u2022\nthe enforceability, validity or scope of protection offered by our patents relating to our products.\nEven if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s time and attention in pursuing these proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets due to licensing requirements and subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.\nOur products and products in development are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, and various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Controls. Exports of our products and technology must be made in compliance with these laws and regulations. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we and certain of our employees could be subject to substantial civil or criminal penalties, including the possible loss of export or import privileges\u037e fines, which may be imposed on us and responsible employees or managers\u037e and, in extreme cases, the incarceration of responsible employees or managers.\nIn addition, changes in our products or solutions or changes in applicable export or import laws and regulations may create delays in the introduction and sale of our products and solutions in international markets, prevent our customers from deploying our products and solutions or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products and solutions to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any change in export or import laws and regulations, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing laws and regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such laws and regulations, could also result in decreased use of our products and solutions, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products and solutions to existing or potential customers. Any decreased use of our products and solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products and solutions would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse outcomes in future legal proceedings could subject us to substantial damages and adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.\nWe may become party to legal proceedings, including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, environmental matters, and other proceedings. Some of these potential proceedings could result in substantial damages or payment awards that exceed our insurance coverage. We will estimate our exposure to any future legal proceedings and establish provisions for the estimated liabilities where it is reasonably possible to estimate and where an adverse outcome is probable. Assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters will involve substantial uncertainties. Furthermore, even if the outcome is ultimately in our favor, our costs associated with such litigation may be material. Adverse outcomes in future legal proceedings or the costs and expenses associated therewith could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe may be required to pay substantial damages as a result of product liability claims for which insurance coverage is not available.\nWe are subject to product liability claims with respect to our SONOVA and GoodWheat products, and as additional products integrating our traits reach commercialization, product liability claims may increasingly be a commercial risk for our business. Product liability claims against us or our collaborators selling products that contain our traits, or allegations of product liability relating to seeds containing traits developed by us, could damage our reputation, harm our relationships with our collaborators, and materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects. Furthermore, while our collaboration agreements typically require that our collaborators indemnify us for the cost of product liability claims brought against us as a result of our collaborator\u2019s misconduct, such indemnification provisions may not always be enforced, and we may receive no indemnification if our own misconduct contributed to the claims.\nWe may seek to expand through acquisitions of and investments in other brands, businesses, and assets. These acquisition activities may be unsuccessful or divert management\u2019s attention.\nWe may consider strategic and complementary acquisitions of and investments in other agricultural biotechnology brands, businesses or other assets, and such acquisitions or investments are subject to risks that could affect our business, including risks related to:\n\u2022\nthe necessity of coordinating geographically disparate organizations\u037e\n\u2022\nimplementing common systems and controls\u037e\n\u2022\nintegrating personnel with diverse business and cultural backgrounds\u037e\n\u2022\nintegrating acquired manufacturing and production facilities, technology and products\u037e\n\u2022\ncombining different corporate cultures and legal systems\u037e\n\u2022\nunanticipated expenses related to integration, including technical and operational integration\u037e\n\u2022\nincreased costs and unanticipated liabilities, including with respect to registration, environmental, health and safety matters, that may affect sales and operating results\u037e\n\u2022\nretaining key employees\u037e\n\u2022\nobtaining required government and third-party approvals\u037e\n\u2022\nlegal limitations in new jurisdictions\u037e\n\u2022\ninstalling effective internal controls and audit procedures\u037e\n\u2022\nissuing common stock that could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders\u037e\n\u2022\nspending cash and incurring debt\u037e\n\u2022\nassuming contingent liabilities\u037e and\n\u2022\ncreating additional expenses.\nWe may not be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions or investments. Similarly, we may not be able to obtain financing for acquisitions or investments on attractive terms. In addition, the success of any acquisitions or investments also will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the acquisition or investment with our existing operations.\nAs a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nPursuant to Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\u201cthe Act\u201d) and the related rules adopted by the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, starting with the second annual report that we filed with the SEC after the consummation of our public offering, our management is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Section 404(b) of the Act requires that our independent registered public accounting firm will also need to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting if we qualify as an accelerated filer or a large accelerated filer.\nIn connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we identified certain internal control deficiencies that did not rise to the level of a significant deficiency or material weakness, on an individual basis or in the aggregate. We are continuously improving our internal control environment. As a result, we may experience higher than anticipated operating expenses, as well as higher auditor fees during and after the implementation of these changes. If we are unable to implement any of the required changes to our internal control over financial reporting effectively or efficiently or are required to do so earlier than anticipated, it could adversely affect our operations, financial reporting, and results of operations and could result in an adverse opinion on internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its NOLs to offset future taxable income. A significant portion of our existing NOLs are limited due to an ownership change under IRC Section 382 that we experienced as a result of the common shares issued in connection with the June 2018 Offering. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. If we undergo an ownership change in the future, our ability to utilize NOLs could be further limited by Section 382 of the Code. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. There is also a risk that, due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. For these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs, whether or not we obtain profitability.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause our stock price to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. As of December 31, 2020, there were 13,450,861 shares of our common stock outstanding, of which approximately 12,264,830 shares were held by non-affiliates. All of our common stock is freely transferable, except shares held by our \u201caffiliates,\u201d as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.\nWe may also issue common stock or options to purchase shares of our common stock that under our 2015 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan and our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Securities issued under these plans\nwill be registered under a Form S-8 and are freely tradable upon issuance. There were 502,973 options exercisable as of December 31, 2020 at a weighted average exercise price of $22.20.\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock since our initial public offering has been and may continue to be volatile. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in May 2015 at a price of $160.00 per share, our stock price has ranged from $2.30 to $176.00, through December 31, 2020. The market price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations in response to various risk factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance, including:\n\u2022\naddition or loss of significant customers, collaborators or distributors\u037e\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our industry or traits\u037e\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel\u037e\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock after an offering\u037e\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in expectations regarding our performance by investors or securities analysts\u037e\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market\u037e\n\u2022\nvolatility in the market price and trading volume of companies in our industry or companies that investors consider comparable\u037e\n\u2022\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares\u037e\n\u2022\nour ability to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights\u037e\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us or our stockholders\u037e\n\u2022\nthe expiration of contractual lock-up agreements\u037e\n\u2022\nlitigation involving us, our industry, or both\u037e\n\u2022\nmajor catastrophic events\u037e and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions and trends.\nFurther, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In addition, the stock prices of many seed and agricultural biotechnology companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political, and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes, or international currency fluctuations, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. If the market price of our common stock fluctuates or declines, you may not realize any return on your investment and may lose some or all of your investment.\nWe expect our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter, which may cause our stock price to fluctuate widely.\nWe expect our quarterly operating results to fluctuate widely and unpredictably for the following reasons, among others:\n\u2022\nour significant customer concentration\u037e\n\u2022\nthe variable timing, stage, and results of our and our collaborators\u2019 development, and regulatory activities\u037e\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our marketing and advertising efforts;\n\u2022\nthe impact of seasonality in agricultural operations on our sales of hemp seeds and products that incorporate our wheat traits\u037e\n\u2022\nadjustments to inventory due to excess or slow-moving;\n\u2022\nsupplier, manufacturing, or quality problems\u037e and\n\u2022\nvariance in the timing of customer and distributor orders for our products.\nFurther, a large proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our significant research and development costs and general and administrative expenses. Thus, even a small decline in revenues could disproportionately affect our quarterly operating results and could cause such results to differ materially from expectations. Any unanticipated change in revenues or operating results is likely to cause our stock price to fluctuate since such changes reflect new information available to investors and analysts.\nBecause we do not expect to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future, investors may be forced to sell their stock to realize a return on their investment.\nWe do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions including compliance with covenants under our debt agreements, and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant. Our ability to pay dividends might be restricted by the terms of any indebtedness that we incur in the future. In addition, certain of our current outstanding debt agreements prohibit us from paying cash dividends on our common stock. Consequently, you should not rely on dividends to receive a return on your investment.", "PERMNO": 15382, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "RKDA"}
