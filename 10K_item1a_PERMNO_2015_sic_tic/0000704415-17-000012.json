Risk Factors\nIn the execution of our business strategy, our operations and financial condition are subject to certain risks. A summary of certain material risks is provided below, and you should take such risks into account in evaluating any investment decision involving the Company. This section does not describe all risks applicable to us and is intended only as a summary of certain material factors that could impact our operations in the industry in which we operate. Other sections of this Report contain additional information concerning these and other risks.\nA significant percentage of our revenues is derived from health plan customers.\nA significant percentage of our revenues is derived from health plan customers. The health plan industry may continue to consolidate, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain health plan customers, or continue to provide our products and services to such health plan customers on terms at least as favorable to us as currently provided, if they are acquired by other health plans that already participate in competing programs or are not interested in our programs. Further, consolidation among our customers, particularly our health plan customers that are part of larger healthcare enterprises, could provide these organizations with greater bargaining power, which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services. In addition, a reduction in the number of covered lives enrolled with our health plan customers or in the payments we receive could adversely affect our results of operations. Our health plan customers are subject to continuing competition and reduced reimbursement rates from governmental and private sources, which could lead current or prospective customers to seek reduced fees or choose to reduce or delay the purchase of our services. Finally, health plan customers could attempt to offer services themselves that compete directly with our offerings or stop providing our offerings to their members.\nReductions in Medicare Advantage health plan reimbursement rates may negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue is indirectly derived from the monthly premium payments paid by HHS to health plans, who are our customers, for services provided to Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. As a result, our results of operations are, in part, dependent on government funding levels for Medicare Advantage programs. Any changes that limit or reduce Medicare Advantage reimbursement levels, such as reductions in or limitations of reimbursement amounts or rates under these programs, reductions in funding of these programs, expansion of benefits without adequate funding, elimination of coverage for certain benefits, or elimination of coverage affecting the services that we provide, could have a material adverse effect on our customers, and as a result, on our business and results of operations.\nWe currently derive a significant percentage of our revenues from two customers.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, Humana and United Healthcare each comprised more than 10%, and together comprised approximately 36%, of our revenues from continuing operations. Our primary contract with Humana was renewed in 2015 and continues through 2020. The term of our contract with United Healthcare continues through 2017. The loss or restructuring of a contract with Humana, United Healthcare or our other significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business strategy relating to the development and introduction of new products and services exposes us to risks such as limited customer acceptance and additional expenditures that may not result in additional net revenue.\nAn important component of our business strategy is to focus on new products and services that enable us to provide immediate value to our customers. Customer acceptance of these new products and services cannot be predicted with certainty, and if we fail to execute properly on this strategy or to adapt this strategy as market conditions evolve, our ability to grow revenue and our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to successfully implement our business strategy, our financial performance and our growth could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future financial performance and success are dependent in large part upon our ability to implement our business strategy successfully. Implementation of our strategy will require effective management of our operational, financial and human resources and will place significant demands on those resources. See Item 1. \"Business - Business Strategy\" for more information regarding our business strategy. There are risks involved in pursuing our strategy, including the ability to hire or retain the personnel necessary to manage our strategy effectively.\nIn addition to the risks set forth above, implementation of our business strategy could be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, such as increased competition, legal developments, government regulation, general economic conditions, increased operating costs or expenses, and changes in industry trends. We may decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time. If we are not able to implement our business strategy successfully, our long-term growth and profitability may be adversely affected. Even if we are able to implement some or all of the initiatives of our business strategy successfully, our operating results may not improve to the extent we anticipate, or at all.\nOur inability to renew and/or maintain contracts with our customers could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf our customers choose not to renew their contracts with us, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in macroeconomic conditions may adversely affect our business.\nEconomic difficulties and other macroeconomic conditions could reduce the demand and/or the timing of purchases for certain of our services from customers and potential customers. Loss of a significant customer or a reduction in a customer's enrolled lives could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, changes in economic conditions could create liquidity and credit constraints. We cannot assure you that we would be able to secure additional financing if needed and, if such funds were available, that the terms and conditions would be acceptable to us.\nWe may experience difficulties associated with the implementation and/or integration of new businesses, services (including outsourced services), technologies, solutions, or products.\nWe may face difficulties, costs, and delays in effectively implementing and/or integrating acquired businesses, services (including outsourced services), or technologies into our business. Implementing internally-developed solutions and/or integrating newly acquired businesses, services (including outsourced services), and technologies could be time-consuming and may strain our resources. Consequently, we may not be successful in implementing and/or integrating these new businesses, services, or technologies and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits.\nThe performance of our business and the level of our indebtedness could prevent us from meeting the obligations under our credit agreement or the cash convertible senior notes or have an adverse effect on our future financial condition, our ability to raise additional capital, or our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry.\nOn June 8, 2012, we entered into the Fifth Amended and Restated Revolving Credit and Term Loan Agreement (as amended, the \"Fifth Amended Credit Agreement\"). On July 16, 2013, we completed the issuance of $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of cash convertible senior notes due 2018 (the \"Cash Convertible Notes\"). As of December 31, 2016, our long-term debt under these arrangements, including the current portion but excluding the debt discount, was $223.5 million.\nOur ability to service our indebtedness (including the debt outstanding under the Fifth Amended Credit Agreement and the Cash Convertible Notes) will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs.\nThe Fifth Amended Credit Agreement contains various financial covenants, restricts the payment of dividends, and limits the amount of repurchases of our common stock. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Fifth Amended Credit Agreement in which all amounts outstanding under the Fifth\nAmended Credit Agreement may become immediately due and payable and all commitments under the Fifth Amended Credit Agreement to extend further credit may be terminated. In addition, a payment default, including an acceleration following an event of default, under the Fifth Amended Credit Agreement or under our indenture for the Cash Convertible Notes could each trigger an event of default under the other debt instrument, which could result in the principal of and the accrued and unpaid interest on such debt becoming due and payable.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our future financial condition or our ability to react to changes in the economy or industry by, among other things:\n\u00b7\nincreasing our vulnerability to a downturn in general economic conditions, loss of revenue and/or profit margins in our business, or to increases in interest rates, particularly with respect to the portion of our outstanding debt that is subject to variable interest rates;\n\u00b7\npotentially limiting our ability to obtain additional financing or to obtain such financing on favorable terms;\n\u00b7\ncausing us to dedicate a portion of future cash flow from operations to service or pay down our debt, which reduces the cash available for other purposes, such as operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities; and\n\u00b7\npossibly limiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be less leveraged.\nThe conditional cash conversion feature of the Cash Convertible Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the Cash Conversion Derivative is triggered, holders of Cash Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Cash Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. Although the Cash Convertible Notes are not currently convertible, the Cash Convertible Notes will become convertible into cash during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter) if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to approximately $25.30 per share. The last reported sale price of our common stock as reported on Nasdaq on March 1, 2017 was $28.95 per share. If one or more holders elect to convert their Cash Convertible Notes, we would be required to pay cash to settle any such conversion, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Cash Convertible Notes, we would be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify the outstanding principal of the Cash Convertible Notes that are convertible as a current rather than long-term liability, which could result in a material reduction of our net working capital and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe accounting for the Cash Convertible Notes and related cash convertible notes hedge transactions may result in volatility to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nThe Cash Conversion Derivative that is part of the Cash Convertible Notes is accounted for as a derivative liability pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 470, Debt, relating to derivative instruments and hedging activities. In general, the initial valuation of the conversion option was bifurcated from the debt component of the Cash Convertible Notes and is measured at fair value each reporting period. For each financial statement period after issuance of the Cash Convertible Notes, a hedge gain (or loss) will be reported in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) to the extent the valuation of the Cash Conversion Derivative changes from the previous period. In connection with the issuance of the Cash Convertible Notes, we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions (the \"Cash Convertible Notes Hedges\"), which are cash-settled, recorded and carried at fair value as a derivative asset and intended to offset the gain (or loss) associated with changes to the valuation of the Cash Conversion Derivative. Although we do not expect there to be a material net impact to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) as a result of our issuing the Cash Convertible Notes and entering into the Cash Convertible Notes Hedges, we cannot assure you these transactions will be completely offset, which may result in volatility to our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the Cash Convertible Notes Hedges.\nThe counterparties to the Cash Convertible Notes Hedges (the \"Counterparties\") are financial institutions\nor affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that these Counterparties may default or otherwise fail to perform, or may exercise certain rights to terminate their obligations, under the Cash Convertible Notes Hedges. Our exposure to the credit risk of the Counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If one or more of the Counterparties to one or more of the Cash Convertible Notes Hedges becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default or other failure to perform, or a termination of obligations by one of the Counterparties we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the Counterparties.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and intangible assets, the value of which could become impaired.\nWe have recorded significant portions of the purchase price of certain acquisitions as goodwill and/or intangible assets. At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $334.7 million and $29.0 million of goodwill and intangible assets, respectively. We review goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment on an annual basis (during the fourth quarter) or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If we determine that the carrying values of our goodwill and/or intangible assets are impaired, we may incur a non-cash charge to earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the period in which the impairment occurs.\nA failure of our information systems could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to deliver our services depends on effectively using information technology.\nWe rely upon our information systems for operating and monitoring all major aspects of our business. These systems and, therefore, our operations could be damaged or interrupted by natural disasters, power loss, network failure, improper operation by our employees, data privacy or security breaches, computer viruses, computer hacking, network penetration or other illegal intrusions or other unexpected events. Any disruption in the operation of our information systems, regardless of the cause, could adversely impact our operations, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA cybersecurity incident could result in the loss of confidential data, give rise to remediation and other expenses, expose us to liability under HIPAA, consumer protection laws, or common law theories, subject us to litigation and federal and state governmental inquiries, damage our reputation, and otherwise be disruptive to our business.\nThe nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of individually identifiable health information about the participants in our programs. The secure maintenance of this confidential information is critical to our business operations. To protect our information systems from attack, damage and unauthorized use, we have implemented multiple layers of security, including technical safeguards, processes, and our people. Our defenses are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties. Despite these efforts, threats from malicious persons and groups, new vulnerabilities, and advanced attacks against information systems create risk of cybersecurity incidents. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to cybersecurity incidents that bypass our security measures, result in loss of personal health information or other data subject to privacy laws or disrupt our information systems or business. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices remain a priority for us. We may be required to expend significant additional resources in our efforts to modify or enhance our protective measures against evolving threats or to investigate and remediate any cybersecurity vulnerabilities. The occurrence of a breach in security of our systems or those of our third-party vendors and other service providers could result in interruptions, delays, the loss, access, misappropriation, disclosure or corruption of data, liability under privacy, security and consumer protection laws or litigation under these or other laws, including common law theories, and subject us to federal and state governmental inquiries, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and harm our business reputation.\nIn order to be successful, we must attract, engage, retain and integrate key employees and have adequate succession plans in place, and failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our ability to\nmanage our business.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract, engage, retain and integrate qualified executives and other key employees throughout all areas of our business. Identifying, developing internally or hiring externally, training and retaining highly-skilled managerial and other personnel are critical to our future, and competition for experienced employees can be intense. Failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations. The loss of services of any key personnel, the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future, or delays in hiring may harm our business and results of operations. Further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe face competition for staffing, which may increase our labor costs and reduce profitability.\nWe compete with other healthcare and services providers in recruiting qualified management, including executives with the required skills and experience to operate and grow our business, and staff personnel for the day-to-day operations of our business. These challenges may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain qualified management and other professionals. Difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified management and other professionals, or in controlling labor costs, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nWe are or may become a party to litigation that could potentially force us to pay significant damages and/or harm our reputation.\nWe are subject to certain legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. These legal proceedings and any other claims that we may face in the future, whether with or without merit, could result in costly litigation, and divert the time, attention, and resources of our management. Although we currently maintain various types of liability insurance, there can be no assurance that the coverage limits of such insurance policies will be adequate or that all such claims will be covered by insurance. Although we believe that we have conducted our operations in full compliance with applicable statutory and contractual requirements and that we have meritorious defenses to outstanding claims, it is possible that resolution of these legal matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, legal expenses associated with the defense of these matters may be material to our results of operations in a particular financial reporting period.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws of other countries in which we provided services prior to the sale of our TPHS business.\nBecause of the international operations that we previously conducted as part of our TPHS business that we sold to Sharecare in July 2016, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws of other countries in which we provided services prior to the sale. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials or other third parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining any business advantage. While our policies mandated compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we cannot provide assurance that our internal control policies and procedures always protected us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, contractors or agents. Failure to comply with the FCPA and similar legislation prior to the sale of our TPHS business could result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines and penalties and could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nCompliance with existing or newly adopted federal and state laws and regulations or new or revised interpretations of such requirements could adversely affect our results of operations or may require us to spend substantial amounts, and the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to penalties or negatively impact our ability to provide services.\nOur customers are subject to considerable state and federal government regulation, and a substantial majority of our business involves providing services to Medicare Advantage beneficiaries. As a result, we are subject directly to various federal laws and regulations, including the federal False Claims Act, billing and reimbursement requirements and other provisions related to fraud and abuse. Further, our contracts with Medicare Advantage plans require us to comply with a number of regulatory provisions and permit these\ncustomers to perform compliance audits. Many of these regulations are vaguely written and subject to differing interpretations that may, in certain cases, result in unintended consequences that could impact our ability to effectively deliver services. Further, we are required to comply with most requirements of the HIPAA privacy and security laws and regulations and may be subject to criminal or civil penalties for violations of these regulations. Certain of our services, including health utilization management and certain claims payment functions, require licensure and may be regulated by government agencies. We are subject to a variety of legal requirements in order to obtain and maintain such licenses, but little guidance is available to determine the scope of some of these requirements.\nWe continually monitor the extent to which federal and state legislation and regulations govern our operations. New federal or state laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing requirements that affect our operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If we are found to have violated applicable laws, to have caused any of our customers to submit false claims or make false statements, or to have failed to comply with our contractual compliance obligations, we could be required to restructure our operations, be subject to contractual penalties, including termination of our customer agreements, and be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties.\nHealthcare reform efforts may result in a reduction to our revenues from government health programs and private insurance companies or otherwise directly or indirectly impact our business.\nThe healthcare industry is subject to various political, regulatory, scientific, and technological influences. Efforts at federal and state levels of government have resulted in laws and regulations intended to effect significant change within the healthcare system. The ACA, the most prominent of these efforts, affects coverage, delivery, and reimbursement of healthcare services. It has decreased the number of uninsured individuals, but may increase the costs and/or reduce the revenues of our customers or prospective customers. For example, the ACA eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions by commercial health plans, bans annual benefit limits, mandates minimum MLRs for health plans, and provides for reductions in funding to Medicare Advantage programs.\nHowever, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the net effect and future impact of the ACA because of the results of the 2016 federal elections, which will likely result in the repeal of the ACA or significant changes to the ACA, its implementation and its interpretation. It is possible that the reforms imposed by the ACA or uncertainty regarding its repeal or significant changes to the law will adversely affect the profitability of our customers and cause our customers or prospective customers to reduce or delay the purchase of our services or to demand reduced fees. Because of this uncertainty and many other variables, including the ACA 's complexity, lack of implementing regulations or interpretive guidance and the outcome of court challenges, we are unable to predict all of the ways in which the ACA could impact the Company. Furthermore, we could also be impacted by future healthcare reform legislative and regulatory initiatives.", "PERMNO": 76788, "SIC": 8090, "TIC": "TVTY"}
