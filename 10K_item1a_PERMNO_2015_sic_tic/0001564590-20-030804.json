Risk Factors\nThe reader should carefully consider these risk factors in addition to those set forth in the Company\u2019s financial statements or the notes thereto. Additional risks about which the Company is not yet aware or that the Company currently believes to be immaterial also may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business operations. If any of the following occur, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected. In that case, the price of the Company\u2019s common stock may decline.\nBusiness Related Risks\nThe Company\u2019s business has been and is expected to continue to be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Company is closely monitoring the effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of its operations and regions, including the effect on its consumers, employees, trade customers, suppliers and distribution channels. The pandemic has created significant business disruption and economic uncertainty, which has adversely affected the Company\u2019s supply chain, distribution channels and consumer demand for its products, and has already directly and indirectly affected the Company\u2019s business and operating results. However, the full extent of its impact will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and the actions to contain or treat its effects, among others. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any other health epidemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change not only with the spread of the disease, but also with the scope and timing of governmental, regulatory, fiscal, monetary and public health responses.\nAs COVID-19 continues to spread, the Company\u2019s business operations could be further disrupted or delayed. The pandemic has already resulted in, and may continue to result in, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, travel restrictions, event cancellation, and other factors that cause an increase in costs or order cancellations, reductions or delays. For example, the Company\u2019s supply chain has been and may in the future be adversely affected with production delays, service disruptions or limited manufacturing volumes\nassociated with shutdowns of factories, logistics providers and shippers or reduced numbers of workers or working hours in the respective facilities, limits on component supplies and diminished capability to implement engineering and design changes in a timely manner. In addition, quarantines, stay at home orders and other travel limitations (whether voluntary or required) may impede the Company\u2019s employees\u2019 ability to efficiently conduct research and development activities or oversee manufacturing and shipping activities, which may slow innovation, lead to higher costs, logistics disruptions or delays in delivering to the Company\u2019s distribution channels and customers . Further, if the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic continues and the Company\u2019s operations continue to be adversely affected, the Company risks a delay, default, violation and/or non-compliance under existing agreements. Many of these effects may not be covered by the Company\u2019s existing insurance coverages.\nThe spread of COVID-19, which has caused a broad impact globally, including restrictions on travel and quarantine policies put into place by businesses and governments, has had and may continue to have a material economic effect on the Company\u2019s business. For example, the pandemic and related measures taken to limit the spread of disease has resulted in higher unemployment and greater economic uncertainty, which may adversely affect consumer purchasing behavior. Consumer fears about becoming ill with the disease may continue, which will adversely affect traffic to retail stores selling the Company\u2019s products. Consumer spending generally may also be negatively affected by general macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence, including the effects of the current recession, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This may negatively affect sales of the Company\u2019s products at retail stores and online marketplace channels and through the Company\u2019s licensing agreements. Any significant reduction in consumer visits to, or spending at, retail stores, caused by COVID-19, and any decreased spending at stores or online caused by decreased consumer confidence and spending following the pandemic, would result in a loss of sales of the Company\u2019s products and profits and other material adverse effects.\nWhile the potential economic effects and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, it has already caused, and is likely to result in further, significant disruption of global financial markets. In addition, the current recession has, and a depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and the market value of its common stock. The Company does not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on its business, its industry or the global economy as a whole, and the Company cannot predict the effects that COVID-19 pandemic-related business disruptions and economic uncertainty will have on its customers, suppliers, consumers, and each of their financial conditions. However, any material effect on these parties could further adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, while significant efforts are underway to slow the spread of COVID-19, develop vaccines and therapeutics, it is unclear when or whether progress in any of those areas will translate into an economic recovery that will restore consumer confidence and accelerate consumer spending. The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial condition. Accordingly, given that the potential of these effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s operations has been and will likely continue to be material, the Company will continue to monitor the situation closely.\nThe Company relies on a small number of key customers for the majority of its business, and the loss or significant reduction in business with any of these key customers would materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and earnings.\nCertain customers have historically made up a significant percentage of the Company\u2019s product sales and net revenues. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, Walmart, Amazon.com and Fred Meyer accounted for approximately 44%, 25% and 11%, respectively, of the Company\u2019s net revenues. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, Walmart, Amazon.com and Fred Meyer accounted for approximately 50%, 16% and 13%, respectively, of the Company\u2019s net revenues. The Company expects that its online marketplaces will increasingly represent a significant portion of the Company\u2019s product sales going forward. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company\u2019s net revenues during these periods. All customer purchases are made through purchase orders and the Company does not have any long-term contracts with its customers. Accordingly, sales from customers that have accounted for a significant portion of the Company\u2019s net product sales and net revenues in past periods, individually or as a group, may not continue in future periods, or if continued, may not reach or exceed historical levels in any period, which has happened in the past and could happen in the future. Some of the Company\u2019s key customers may also experience economic difficulties or otherwise default on their obligations to the Company. The complete loss of, or significant reduction in business from, or a material adverse change in the financial condition of, any of the Company\u2019s key customers would cause a material and adverse change in the Company\u2019s revenues and operating results.\nThe Company is dependent on a limited number of products for its sales.\nThe Company derives a substantial portion of its product revenues from a limited number of products, and the Company expects these products to continue to account for a large percentage of its product revenues in the near term. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2020, the Company\u2019s gross product sales were comprised principally of four product types within two categories - housewares products and audio products - and microwave ovens, which product type is within the housewares category - generated approximately 35% of the Company\u2019s gross product sales. Audio products generated approximately 61% of the Company\u2019s gross product sales during fiscal 2020. For the twelve months ended March 31, 2019, the Company\u2019s gross product sales were comprised\nprincipally of the same four product types within the same two categories - housewares products and audio products - and microwave ovens, which product type is within the housewares category, generated approximately 39% of the Company\u2019s gross product sales. Audio products generated approximately 57% of the Company\u2019s gross product sales during fiscal 2019. Because the market for these product types and categories is characterized by periodic new product introductions, the Company\u2019s future financial performance will depend, in part, on the successful and timely development and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of these product types and other products distributed by the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be successful in marketing these product types within these categories or any other new or enhanced products. For example, certain of the Company\u2019s key customers perform periodic line reviews to assess their product offerings, which have in the past and may in the future lead to loss of business and pricing pressures. As a result of this dependence, a significant decline in pricing of, or market acceptance of these product types and categories, either in general or specifically as marketed by the Company, would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operation.\nThe loss or reduction of business of one or a combination of its houseware and audio product lines could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the Company\u2019s third party sales representatives fail to adequately promote, market and sell the Company\u2019s products, the Company\u2019s revenues could significantly decrease.\nA significant portion of the Company\u2019s product sales are made through third party sales representative organizations, whose members are not employees of the Company. The Company\u2019s level of sales depends on the effectiveness of these organizations, as well as the effectiveness of its own employees. Some of these third party representatives may sell (and do sell), with the Company\u2019s permission, competitive products of third parties as well as the Company\u2019s products. During the Company\u2019s fiscal years ended March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2019, these organizations were responsible for approximately 87% and 96%, respectively, of its net revenues during such periods. In addition, one of these representative organizations was responsible for a significant portion of these revenues. If any of the Company\u2019s third party sales representative organizations engaged by the Company, especially the Company\u2019s largest, fails to adequately promote, market and sell its products, the Company\u2019s revenues could be significantly decreased until a replacement organization or distributor could be retained by the Company, which has happened in the past and could happen in the future. The loss or reduction of product sales made through third party sales representative organizations could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. Finding replacement organizations and distributors could be a time consuming process during which the Company\u2019s revenues could be negatively impacted.\nThe concentration of product sales among a limited number of retailers and the trend toward private label brands could materially reduce revenues and profitability.\nWith the concentration of the Company\u2019s product sales among a limited number of retailers, the Company is dependent upon a small number of customers whose bargaining strength is growing. These retailers generally purchase a limited selection of houseware and consumer electronic products. As a result, there is significant competition for retail shelf space. In addition, certain of the Company\u2019s key customers use their own private label brands that compete directly with some of the Company\u2019s products. As the retailers in the houseware and consumer electronic industry become more concentrated, competition for sales to these retailers may increase, which could materially reduce the Company's revenues and profitability.\nThe houseware and consumer electronic industry is consolidating, which could reduce the Company\u2019s ability to successfully secure product placements at key customers and limit its ability to sustain a cost competitive position in the industry.\nOver the past several years, the houseware and consumer electronic industry has undergone substantial consolidation, and further consolidation is likely. As a result of this consolidation, the houseware and consumer electronic industry primarily consists of a limited number of large retailers and distributors. The Company\u2019s ability to gain or maintain share of sales in the houseware and consumer electronic industry or maintain or enhance its relationships with key customers may be limited as a result of actions by competitors or the retailers\u2019 increasing use of private label brands.\nThe failure to obtain new licensees and distribution relationships or to maintain relationships with its existing licensees and distributors could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues, earnings and business.\nThe Company maintains agreements that allow licensees to use the Company\u2019s trademarks for the manufacture and sale of specific consumer electronics and other products into defined geographic areas. These agreements typically are for a limited period of time and, upon expiration, the Company cannot assure that its agreements with its licensees will be renewed in the future or that the Company\u2019s relationships with its licensees or distributors will be maintained on satisfactory terms or at all. Although the Company has engaged LMCA as an agent to assist the Company in identifying and procuring licensing opportunities, there can be no assurance that the Company will find and secure suitable licensees or distribution relationships. If the Company is unable to maintain its relationships with its licensees and distributors on terms satisfactory to the Company, or if it fails to obtain new licensees or\ndistribution relationships or the Company\u2019s licensees fail to protect the integrity and reputation of the Company\u2019s trademarks, the value of the Emerson brand and the Company\u2019s licensing revenues and earnings could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company depends on a limited number of suppliers for its products. If its relationships with such suppliers terminate or are otherwise impaired, the Company would likely experience increased costs, disruptions in the manufacture and shipment of its products and a material loss of net sales.\nAlthough there are multiple potential suppliers for each of the Company\u2019s products, the Company relies and is dependent on a limited number of suppliers for its main products, all of which are located outside of the United States.\nThe Company does not have any long-term or exclusive purchase commitments with any of its suppliers. Itoma was the Company\u2019s largest supplier and accounted for 50% of the Company\u2019s purchases of products during fiscal 2020. The Company\u2019s failure to maintain existing relationships with its suppliers or to establish new relationships on similar pricing and credit terms in the future could negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain products in a timely manner. If the Company is unable to obtain an ample supply of product from its existing suppliers or secure alternative sources of supply, it may be unable to satisfy its customers\u2019 orders, which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and relationships with its customers. Finding replacement suppliers could be a time consuming process during which the Company\u2019s revenues and liquidity could be negatively impacted.\nIncreases in costs of products may materially reduce the Company\u2019s profitability.\nFactors that are largely beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as the cost, quality and availability of the raw materials and components needed by suppliers of the Company\u2019s products, may affect the cost of such products, and the Company may not be able to pass those costs on to its customers. As an example, when the prices of petroleum increase significantly, the Company\u2019s profitability may be negatively impacted.\nIf the Company is unable to deliver products in the required amounts and in a timely fashion, the Company could experience delays or reductions in shipments to its customers, which could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and relationships with its customers.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to provide high quality customer service, process and fulfill orders, and manage inventory depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation and timely and uninterrupted performance of its suppliers. The Company can provide no assurances that it will not experience operational difficulties with its suppliers, including reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines, increases in manufacturing costs, increased lead times or production shutdowns or production slowdowns due to social distancing guidelines or issues with absenteeism related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which have and could in the future result in increased costs and decreased efficiency. If the Company is unable to obtain products from these factories in the required quantities and quality and in a timely fashion, the Company could experience delays or reductions in product shipments to its customers, which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s ability to meet the requirements of its customers, as well as its relationships with its customers, which in turn could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and operating results.\nAll the Company\u2019s suppliers are based in China and as a result the Company is subject to risks associated with international operations and global manufacturing and sourcing including, among others:\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations;\n\u2022\nlabor disputes and union actions that can disrupt the Company\u2019s ability to ship products to customers;\n\u2022\npotential political, economic and social instability;\n\u2022\nPublic health threats, inclement weather and natural disasters;\n\u2022\npossible acts of terrorism;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on transfers of funds;\n\u2022\nchanges in import and export duties and quotas;\n\u2022\nchanges in domestic and international customs and tariffs;\n\u2022\nuncertainties involving the costs to transport products;\n\u2022\ndisruptions in the global transportation network;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory environments;\n\u2022\nregulatory issues involved in dealing with foreign suppliers and in exporting and importing products;\n\u2022\nprotection of intellectual property;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in complying with a variety of foreign laws;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in obtaining distribution and support; and\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences.\nFurthermore, any material disruption, slowdown or shutdown of the operation of the Company\u2019s principal logistics providers and shippers, including without limitation as a result of labor disputes, public health threats (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), social unrest, inclement weather, natural disasters, possible acts of terrorism, availability of shipping containers and increased security restrictions, could cause delays in the Company\u2019s ability to receive, process and fulfill customer orders and may cause orders to be canceled, lost or delivered late, goods to be returned or receipt of goods to be refused. As a result, the Company\u2019s relationships with its customers, revenues and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company relies on a third-party logistics provider for the storage and distribution of its products in the United States and, if such third party logistics provider incurs any damage to the facilities where the Company\u2019s products are stored or is unable to distribute its products as needed, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and business.\nThe Company relies on a third-party logistics provider for the storage and distribution of its products. The facilities where the Company\u2019s products are stored by such provider may also be harmed or rendered inoperable by natural or man-made disasters, including earthquakes, power outages, communications failure or terrorism. Any material damage to the facilities where the Company\u2019s products are stored could adversely affect its inventory and the ability of such third-party logistics provider to meet the needs of its customers. In addition, an inability to maintain the Company\u2019s contracts with such third-party logistics providers or a delay, disruption or quality control problems in the operations of such third-party logistics provider, including as a result of damage to the facilities of such provider or a strike by such provider, could cause delays in the Company\u2019s ability to fulfill customer orders and may cause orders to be canceled, lost or delivered late, the Company\u2019s products to be returned or receipt of products to be refused, any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. The Company\u2019s contract with its third-party logistics provider is terminable upon written notice by either party for convenience without cause. If the Company is unable to maintain its contract with its third-party logistics provider, the Company would be required to retain a new third party logistics provider and the Company may be unable to retain such third party at a cost that is acceptable to the Company. If the Company\u2019s shipping costs were to increase as a result of an increase by such third-party logistics providers or as a result of obtaining a new third-party logistics provider and if the Company is unable to pass on these higher costs to its customers, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and business.\nThe Company\u2019s business could be materially and adversely affected if it cannot protect its intellectual property rights or if it infringes on the intellectual property rights of others.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete effectively depends on its ability to maintain and protect its proprietary rights. The Company owns the Emerson\u00ae and other trademarks, which are materially important to its business, as well as other trademarks, licenses and proprietary rights that are used for certain of the products that it markets and sells. The Company\u2019s trademarks are registered throughout the world, including the United States and other countries. The laws of some foreign countries in which the Company operates may not protect the Company\u2019s proprietary rights to the same extent as do laws in the United States. The protections afforded by the laws of such countries may not be adequate to protect the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights.\nThird parties may seek to challenge, invalidate, circumvent or render unenforceable any trademarks, patents or proprietary rights owned by or licensed to the Company. In addition, in the event third party licensees fail to protect the integrity of the Company\u2019s trademarks, the value of these marks could be materially and adversely affected. The Company\u2019s inability to protect its proprietary rights could materially and adversely affect the license of its trade names, trademarks and other proprietary rights to third parties as well as its ability to sell its products. Litigation has been and may in the future be necessary to enforce the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights, protect the Company\u2019s trade secrets; and determine the scope and validity of such intellectual property rights. Any such litigation, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management\u2019s attention from the operation of the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company may receive notices of claims of infringement of other parties\u2019 proprietary rights. Such actions could result in litigation and the Company could incur significant costs and diversion of resources in defending such claims. The party making such claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief. Such relief could effectively block the Company\u2019s ability to make, use, sell, distribute or market its products and services in such jurisdiction. The Company may also be required to seek licenses to such intellectual property. The Company cannot predict, however, whether such\nlicenses would be available or, if available, that such licenses could be obtained on terms that are commercially reasonable and acceptable to the Company. The failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could delay or preclude the sale, manufacture or distribution of its products and could result in increased costs to the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s revenues and earnings could be materially and adversely affected if it cannot anticipate market trends or enhance existing products or achieve market acceptance of new products.\nThe Company\u2019s success is dependent on its ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands and trends in a timely manner, as well as expanding into new markets and sourcing new products that are profitable to the Company. In addition, to increase the Company\u2019s penetration of current markets and gain footholds in new markets for its products, the Company must maintain its existing products and integrate them with new products. The Company may not be successful in sourcing, marketing and releasing new products that respond to technological developments or changing customer needs and preferences. The Company may also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and sale of these new products. These new products may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and may not achieve any significant degree of market acceptance. If release dates of any future products or enhancements to the Company\u2019s products are delayed, or if these products or enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance when released, the Company\u2019s sales volume may decline and earnings could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, new products or enhancements by the Company\u2019s competitors may cause customers to defer or forgo purchases of the Company\u2019s products, which could also materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and earnings.\nCash generated by operating activities represents the Company\u2019s principal source of funding and therefore the Company depends on its ability to successfully manage its operating cash flows to fund its operations.\nThe Company does not maintain any credit facilities (other than, from time to time, certain letters of credit) in connection with the operation of its business. The Company has relied on, and continues to rely on, its cash on hand and cash generated by operations to manage its business. Certain of the Company\u2019s major factory suppliers, including Itoma, extend credit lines to the Company in amounts based on various factors, including the amounts of the Company\u2019s purchases and their internal credit criteria, and in the past have reduced the maximum amount of open credit lines available to the Company. The loss of, or reduction in, credit lines from the Company\u2019s principal suppliers could reduce the Company\u2019s liquidity, increase its working capital needs or limit its ability to purchase products which could adversely affect its financial condition or results of operations. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash from operations, the Company may need to secure alternative means of financing or reorganize its operations to continue to maintain the current business.\nForeign regulations and changes in trade policies and the political, social and economic conditions in the United States and the foreign countries in which the Company operates its business could affect the Company\u2019s revenues and earnings materially and adversely.\nThe Company has operations in China and derives a significant portion of its revenue from sales of products manufactured by third parties located in China. In addition, third parties located in China and other countries located in the same region produce and supply many of the components and raw materials used in the Company\u2019s products. Additionally, a significant portion of the shipping of the Company\u2019s finished goods to the United States occurs through Hong Kong. Conducting an international business inherently involves a number of difficulties and risks that could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to generate revenues and could subject the Company to increased costs. Furthermore, the current U.S. administration continues to signal its intent to alter trade agreements between China and the U.S. and may impose additional tariffs on imports from China. It is possible that further tariffs may be imposed on the categories of products the Company imports to the United States, or that the Company\u2019s business will be affected by retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response to existing or future tariffs, causing the Company to raise prices or make changes to its operations, any of which could adversely affect demand for the Company\u2019s products or increase its costs.\nAmong the other factors that may adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and increase its costs are:\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations which could cause an increase in the price of the components and raw materials used in the Company\u2019s products and a decrease in its profits;\n\u2022\nChinese labor laws;\n\u2022\nlabor shortages affecting the Company\u2019s facilities and its suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities located in China;\n\u2022\nthe elimination or reduction of value-added tax refunds to Chinese factories that manufacture products for export;\n\u2022\nthe rise of inflation and substantial economic growth in China;\n\u2022\nmore stringent export restrictions in the countries in which the Company operates which could adversely affect its ability to deliver its products to its customers;\n\u2022\ntariffs and other trade barriers which could make it more expensive for the Company to obtain and deliver its products to its customers;\n\u2022\npolitical instability and economic downturns in these countries which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain its products from its manufacturers or deliver its products to its customers in a timely fashion;\n\u2022\noutbreaks of public health threats, such as COVID-19, influenza and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, affecting the production capabilities of the Company\u2019s suppliers, including as a result of quarantines or closures;\n\u2022\nnew restrictions on the sale of electronic products containing certain hazardous substances; and\n\u2022\nthe laws of China are likely to govern many of the Company\u2019s supplier agreements.\nAny of the factors described above may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues and/or increase its operating expenses.\nTariffs or other restrictions placed on the Company\u2019s products imported into the United States from China, or any related countermeasures taken by China, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, profitability and results of operations.\nThe Company has operations in China and all of the Company\u2019s products are currently manufactured by suppliers in China. Any tariffs or other trade restrictions affecting the import of these products from China or any retaliatory trade measures taken by China in response to existing or future tariffs could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations going forward. The Company\u2019s dependency on its overseas suppliers could exacerbate these and other risks, and any tariffs on the categories of products the Company imports to the United States could negatively affect the demand for such products, increase the cost of components, delay production or affect the Company\u2019s ability to compete against competitors who do not manufacture in China or otherwise are not subject to such tariffs.\nBeginning in 2018, the United States has imposed additional duties, ranging from 10% to 25%, on a variety of goods imported from China. Effective in September 2018, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (\u201cUSTR\u201d) imposed tariffs of 10% on approximately $200 billion worth of goods imported from China (\u201cList 3 products\u201d), including categories of products the Company imports from China and increased these tariffs to 25% effective in May 2019. In August 2019, the U.S. administration directed the USTR to increase tariffs on List 3 products from 25% to 30% effective October 2019, which increases were subsequently delayed indefinitely. In May 2019, the USTR proposed imposing additional tariffs of up to 25% on essentially all remaining Chinese-origin imports, including approximately $300 billion worth of goods imported from China (\u201cList 4 products\u201d). Tariffs of 15% were imposed on certain List 4 products effective in September 2019 (\u201cList 4A products\u201d), and the remainder were scheduled to be subject to these tariffs effective in December 2019 (\u201cList 4B products\u201d). In January 2020, the United States and China signed a Phase One Economic and Trade Agreement, pursuant to which the tariff increases on the List 4B products remained suspended and the rate of additional tariffs on the List 4A products was reduced to 7.5%, while all other tariffs remain in place. The effects on the Company of the recently imposed and proposed tariffs are uncertain because of the dynamic nature of governmental actions and responses, as well as possible exemptions for certain products. If the U.S. and China are able to negotiate the issues to restore a mutually advantageous and fair trading regime, the increased tariffs could be eliminated, but given the uncertainties, there can be no assurance of whether, or when, this will be accomplished. If the recently imposed and proposed tariffs covering the categories of products that the Company imports continue or are increased, and the Company is unable to obtain an exception, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nAlthough the Company is monitoring the trade environment and working to mitigate the possible effect of tariffs through pricing and sourcing strategies, including through proactive management of inventory built up in advance of the recent tariff increases, and may take additional steps, the Company cannot be certain how its customers and competitors will react to the actions taken. Additional tariffs imposed by the United States, and any related countermeasures by China, could increase the Company\u2019s cost of goods and reduce its gross margins. If the Company determines to pass some or all of these new tariff burdens on to its customers as product price increases in the future, the result may be a degradation of the Company\u2019s competitive position and a loss of customers that would adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating performance. However, the ultimate outcome of these tariff actions is not clear at this time, and there can be no assurances that the Company\u2019s mitigation efforts will be successful or that the imposition of any such tariffs or trade actions would not have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s revenue, gross margins and operating results.\nThe Company is subject to intense competition in the industry in which it operates, which could cause material changes in the selling price of its products or losses of its market share.\nThe housewares and consumer electronics industry is highly competitive, especially with respect to pricing and the introduction of new products and features. The Company\u2019s products compete in the low to medium-priced sector of the housewares and consumer\nelectronics market and compete primarily on the basis of reliability, brand recognition, quality, price, design, consumer acceptance of the Emerson\u00ae trademark and quality service and support to retailers and its customers. The Company and many of its competitors are subject to factory cost increases, and the Company expects these pressures to continue. If these pressures are not mitigated by increases in selling price or cost reductions from the Company\u2019s suppliers or changes in product mix, or if the consumers of the Company\u2019s products change their buying habits as a result of the Company\u2019s actions, the Company\u2019s revenues and profits could be substantially reduced. In addition, the Company\u2019s expanded marketing plan includes sales through online marketplaces, including Amazon.com, and the success of this plan depends on the Company\u2019s ability to increase its visibility and continue to distribute its products through these online marketplaces. As compared to the Company, many of its competitors have significantly greater managerial, financial, marketing, technical and other competitive resources and greater brand recognition. As a result, the Company\u2019s competitors may be able to (i) adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements; (ii) devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services; and (iii) respond more effectively to pricing pressures. Competition could increase if new companies enter the market, existing competitors expand their product mix or the Company expands into new markets. An increase in competition could result in material price reductions or loss of the Company\u2019s market share.\nIn addition, the industry in which the Company competes generally has low barriers to entry that allow the introduction of new products or new competitors at a fast pace. Some retailers have begun to introduce their own private label products, which could reduce the volume of product they buy from the Company, as well as decrease the shelf space they allocate to the Company\u2019s products. If the Company is unable to protect the Company\u2019s brand image and authenticity, the Company may be unable to effectively compete with these new market entrants or new products.\nChanges in consumer spending and economic conditions may cause the Company\u2019s operating results to fluctuate and cause its stock price to decline.\nThe Company\u2019s net revenue and operating results may vary significantly from year to year, which may adversely affect its results of operations and the market price for its common stock. Factors that may cause these fluctuations include:\n\u2022\nchanges in market and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe discretionary nature of consumers\u2019 demands and spending patterns;\n\u2022\nvariations in the sales of the Company\u2019s products to its significant customers;\n\u2022\nvariations in manufacturing and supplier relationships;\n\u2022\nif the Company is unable to correctly anticipate and provide for inventory requirements, it may not have sufficient inventory to deliver its products to its customers in a timely fashion or the Company may have excess inventory that it is unable to sell;\n\u2022\nnew product developments or introductions;\n\u2022\nproduct reviews and other media coverage;\n\u2022\ncompetition, including competitive price pressures; and\n\u2022\npolitical instability, war, acts of terrorism, public health threats or other disasters.\nThe Company could be exposed to product liability or other claims for which its product liability or other insurance may be inadequate.\nA failure of any of the products marketed by the Company may subject it to the risk of product liability claims and litigation arising from injuries allegedly caused by the improper functioning or design of its products. Although the Company currently maintains product liability insurance in amounts which the Company considers adequate, the Company cannot assure that:\n\u2022\nits insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities;\n\u2022\nadequate product liability insurance will continue to be available in the future; or\n\u2022\nits insurance can be maintained on acceptable terms.\nTo the extent product liability or other litigation losses are beyond the limits or scope of the Company\u2019s insurance coverage, the Company\u2019s expenses could materially increase.\nAn information systems interruption or breach in security, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company electronically maintains sensitive data, including intellectual property, its proprietary business information and that of its customers and suppliers, and some personally identifiable information of employees, in its facilities and on its networks. In addition, the Company sells its products through online marketplaces, including Amazon.com, which rely upon third-party online payment platform service providers that maintain personal information collected from customers. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to the Company\u2019s operations. A breach of the Company\u2019s security systems and procedures or those of its vendors could result in significant data losses or theft of the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 or the Company\u2019s employees\u2019 intellectual property, proprietary business information or personally identifiable information. A cybersecurity breach could negatively affect the Company\u2019s reputation.\nBecause the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, hardware, software or applications the Company procures from third parties or uses in its online marketplaces may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to the Company\u2019s systems or facilities through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving its employees. Accordingly, the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, or if such measures are implemented, and even with appropriate training conducted in support of such measures, human errors may still occur. It is virtually impossible for the Company to entirely mitigate this risk. A party, whether internal or external, who is able to circumvent the Company\u2019s security measures or those of its vendors could misappropriate information.\nIf the Company or the online payment platforms it uses fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information, the Company may suffer significant reputational and financial losses and the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and liquidity may be adversely affected. In addition, a system breach could result in other negative consequences, including disruption of internal operations, and may subject the Company to private litigation, government investigations, enforcement actions, and cause the Company to incur potentially significant liability, damages, or remediation costs.\nFluctuations in the Company\u2019s tax obligations and effective tax rate and realization of deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards, may result in volatility of the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in various U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company records tax expense based on its estimates of future payments, which may include reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions, and valuation allowances related to certain net deferred tax assets, including net operating loss carryforwards. In addition, tax laws in certain jurisdictions may limit the ability to use net operating loss carryforwards upon a change in control. At any one time, many tax years may be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. The results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues. In addition, the Company\u2019s effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially affected by a variety of factors including but not limited to changes in the mix and level of revenues, varying tax rates in the different jurisdictions in which the Company operates, fluctuations in the valuation allowance, timing of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards, or by changes to existing accounting rules or regulations. Further, tax legislation or changes in tax rules and regulations or the interpretations thereof, including but not limited to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, may be enacted in the future which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s current or future tax structure and effective tax rates.\nStock Ownership Risks\nThere is a limited trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock and the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock is subject to volatility.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock, which trades on the NYSE American, has experienced, and may experience in the future, significant price and volume fluctuations, which could adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. The market price of the Company\u2019s common stock could fluctuate significantly in response to various factors and events, including:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in operating results and cash flows;\n\u2022\nloss of a key customer, licensee or supplier;\n\u2022\nannouncements or events that affect the Company\u2019s products, customers, competitors or markets;\n\u2022\ngeneral business conditions in the markets and industry in which the Company competes;\n\u2022\nthe level of the Company\u2019s stock repurchase activity;\n\u2022\nconcentration of holdings of the Company\u2019s common stock; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those listed under this section entitled \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nIn addition, the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations over the past several years that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE American rules and, as a result, qualifies for, and relies on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. As a result, the Company\u2019s shareholders do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.\nNimble Holdings Company Limited (\u201cNimble\u201d), formerly known as The Grande Holdings Limited (\u201cGrande\u201d), through one of its indirect subsidiaries, is the beneficial owner of approximately 72.4% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock as of March 31, 2020. As a result, the Company is a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE American Company Guide. Under the NYSE American rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by another person or group of persons acting together is a controlled company and may elect not to comply with certain NYSE American corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that:\n\u2022\na majority of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors consist of independent directors;\n\u2022\nthe Company has a nominating committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u2022\nthe Company has a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities.\nThe Company has elected to use certain of these exemptions and the Company may continue to use all or some of these exemptions in the future for so long as the Company is a controlled company. The Company\u2019s Board of Directors acts as the nominating committee and compensation committee and determines the compensation and benefits of the Company\u2019s executive officers, administers its employee stock and benefit plans, as may be in effect from time to time, and reviews policies relating to the compensation and benefits of its employees. Although all board members have fiduciary obligations in connection with compensation matters, the Company\u2019s lack of an independent compensation committee presents the risk that any executive officers who are also directors may have influence over their personal compensation and benefits levels that may not be commensurate with the Company\u2019s financial performance. Accordingly, shareholders of the Company do not have the same protections afforded to shareholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE American.\nThe controlling ownership of the Company\u2019s common stock by an indirect subsidiary of Nimble substantially reduces the influence of other stockholders, and the interests of Nimble may conflict with the interests of the Company\u2019s other stockholders.\nNimble, through one of its indirect subsidiaries, is the beneficial owner of approximately 72.4% of the Company\u2019s outstanding common stock as of March 31, 2020. As a result, Nimble will be able to exert significant influence over the Company\u2019s business and have the ability to control the approval process for actions by the Company that require stockholder approval, including: the election of the Company\u2019s directors and the approval of mergers, sales of assets or other significant corporate transactions or matters submitted for stockholder approval. Nimble may have interests that differ from your interests and may cause the shares in the Company beneficially owned by Nimble to be voted in a way with which you disagree and that may be adverse to your interests. In addition, several provisions of the Company\u2019s organizational documents and Delaware law may deter or prevent a takeover attempt, including a takeover attempt in which the potential purchaser offers to pay a per share price greater than the current market price of its common stock. Under the terms of the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation, its board of directors has the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof. These provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control transaction. They could also have the effect of discouraging others from making tender offers for the Company\u2019s common stock, including transactions that may be in your best interests.\nThe Company\u2019s bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the federal district courts in Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by the Company\u2019s stockholders, which could limit stockholders\u2019 ability to have certain claims heard in any other judicial forum.\nPursuant to the Company\u2019s corporate bylaws, as amended by the Board of Directors on June 22, 2020, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company; (ii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company or any stockholder to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders; (iii) any action or proceeding asserting a claim against the Company or any current or former director, officer or other employee of the Company or any stockholder arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of Delaware or the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation or bylaws (as each may be amended from time to time); (iv) any action or proceeding to\ninterpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation or bylaws (including any right, obligation or remedy thereunder); (v) any action or proceeding as to which the General Corporation Law of Delaware confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and (vi) any action asserting a claim against the Company or any director, officer or other employee of the Company or any stockholder, governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to the court\u2019s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. This forum selection clause in the bylaws, as so amended, does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any other claim for which the federal courts of the United States of America have exclusive jurisdiction. The bylaws, as so amended, further provide, that, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In addition, the bylaws, as so amended, provide that any person or entity holding, owning or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the Company shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to these provisions. The forum selection clause in the Company\u2019s bylaws, as so amended, may limit stockholders\u2019 ability to have certain claims heard in any court other than in the Court of Chancery or the federal district courts in Delaware.", "PERMNO": 81124, "SIC": 3651, "TIC": "MSN"}
