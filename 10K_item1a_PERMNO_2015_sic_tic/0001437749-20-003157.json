{"cik": "1466593", "company": "Otter Tail Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRISK FACTORS AND CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS\nOur businesses are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this report on Form 10-K or in our other SEC filings could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additional risks and uncertainties we are not presently aware of or that we currently consider immaterial may also affect our business, financial condition, results operations and cash flows.\nOversight of Risk and Related Processes\nA key accountability of the Board of Directors is the oversight of material risk. Management and the Board of Directors have responsibility for overseeing the identification and mitigation of top risks. Management identifies and analyzes risks to determine the impact and other attributes such as timing, likelihood and management control. Identification and analysis occur formally through a top risk assessment conducted by senior management, the financial disclosure process, and internal auditing and compliance with financial and operational controls. Management also identifies and analyzes risk through development of goals and key performance indicators, which include risk identification to determine barriers to implementing our strategy. We promote a culture of compliance, including tone at the top. The process for risk mitigation includes adherence to our code of conduct and compliance policies, operation of formal risk management structures and overall business management to mitigate the risks inherent in the implementation of strategy. We manage and further mitigate risks through formal risk management structures, including a management executive risk committee and services such as internal audit/business risk management and legal. Management communicates regularly with our Board of Directors and key stakeholders regarding risk. Senior management presents and communicates a periodic risk assessment to our Board of Directors which provides information on the risks management believes are material, including the earnings impact, timing, likelihood and management control. The Board of Directors approaches oversight, management and mitigation of risk as an integral and continuous part of its governance of Otter Tail Corporation. The Board of Directors regularly reviews management\u2019s top risk assessment and analyzes areas of existing and future risks and opportunities. Finally, the Board of Directors conducts an annual strategy session where our future plans and initiatives are reviewed.\nGENERAL\nFederal and state environmental regulation could require us to incur substantial capital expenditures and increased operating costs.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, waste management, natural resources and health safety. These laws and regulations regulate the modification and operation of existing facilities, the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper storage, handling, cleanup and disposal of hazardous waste and toxic substances. Compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant resources and funds toward environmental monitoring, installation and operation of pollution control equipment, payment of emission fees and securing environmental permits. Obtaining environmental permits can entail significant expense and cause substantial construction delays. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if caused by factors beyond our control, may result in civil or criminal liabilities, penalties and fines.\nExisting environmental laws or regulations may be revised, and new laws or regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us. Revised or additional regulations, which result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from customers, could have a material effect on our results of operations.\nWeather impacts, including normal seasonal fluctuation of weather, as well as extreme weather events that could be associated with climate change, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOTP\u2019s business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on its financial performance. Demand for electricity is normally greater in the winter and summer months. Unusually mild summers and winters could have an adverse effect on OTP\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the companies in our Plastics segments are affected by weather\u2019s impact on contractors whose work can be delayed and therefore reduce the need for PVC pipe during winter weather and extreme wet conditions. Our businesses are located in areas that could be subject to seasonal natural disasters such as severe snow and ice storms, tornadoes, flooding and fires. These factors could result in interruption of our business and damage to our facilities. An extreme weather event within our utility service areas could directly affect our capital assets, causing disruption in service to customers, due to downed wires and poles or damage to other operating equipment.\nIn addition to variations in seasonal weather patterns, more widespread climate change may also create physical and financial risks to the Company. Physical risks of climate change, such as more frequent or more extreme weather events, changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, changes to ground and surface water availability, and other related phenomena, could affect some or all of our operations. Severe weather or other natural disasters related to climate change could be destructive, which could result in increased costs and delayed capital projects at OTP. Extreme weather conditions, such as uncommonly long periods of high or low ambient temperature, in general require more system backup, adding to costs, and can contribute to increased system stress, including service interruptions. Such risks could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company may also be subject to litigation related to climate change. Costs of such litigation could be significant, and an adverse outcome could require substantial capital expenditures, changes in operations and possible payment of penalties or damages which could affect the Company's results of operations and cash flows if the costs are not recoverable in rates or covered by insurance.\nVolatile financial markets and changes in our debt ratings could restrict our ability to access capital and increase borrowing costs and pension plan and postretirement health care expenses.\nWe rely on access to both short- and long-term capital markets, on acceptable terms and at reasonable costs, as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flows from operations. If we are unable to access capital at competitive rates, our ability to implement our business plans may be adversely affected. Market disruptions or a downgrade of our credit ratings may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to access one or more financial markets. Market disruptions could include: a significant economic downturn, volatility in commodity prices, turmoil in the financial services industry and deterioration in capital market conditions. OTP is a party to contracts that require the posting of collateral or settlement of applicable contracts if credit ratings fall below certain levels.\nBorrowings under our revolving credit agreements currently use LIBOR as the base to determine the applicable interest rate to charge. LIBOR is currently expected to be eliminated by January 1, 2022. The credit agreements contain provisions to determine how interest rates will be established in the event a replacement for LIBOR has not been identified before the agreements expire on October 31, 2024. There is no assurance the replacement for LIBOR will be as favorable as LIBOR.\nDisruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the financial markets can also adversely impact our results of operations, the ability of customers to finance purchases of goods and services, and our financial condition, as well as exert downward pressure on stock prices and/or limit our ability to sustain our current common stock dividend level.\nTo the extent financial markets view climate change and emissions of GHGs as a financial risk, this could negatively affect the Company's stock price or the Company\u2019s ability to access capital markets on favorable terms and conditions.\nChanges in the U.S. capital markets could also have significant effects on our pension plan. Our pension income or expense is affected by factors including the market performance of the assets in the master pension trust maintained for the pension plan for some of our employees, the weighted average asset allocation and long-term rate of return of our pension plan assets, the discount rate used to determine the service and interest cost components of our net periodic pension cost and assumed rates of increase in our employees\u2019 future compensation. If our pension plan assets do not achieve positive rates of return, or if our estimates and assumed rates are not accurate, our earnings may decrease because net periodic pension costs would rise and we could be required to provide additional funds to cover our obligations to employees under the pension plan.\nWe could be required to contribute additional capital to the pension plan in the future if the market value of pension plan assets significantly declines, plan assets do not earn in line with our long-term rate of return assumptions or relief under the Pension Protection Act is no longer granted.\nAny significant impairment of our goodwill would cause a decrease in our asset values and a reduction in our net operating income.\nWe had approximately $37.6 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019. We have recorded goodwill for businesses in our Manufacturing and Plastics business segments. If we make changes in our business strategy or if market or other conditions adversely affect operations in any of these businesses, we may be forced to record an impairment charge, which would lead to decreased assets and a reduction in net operating performance. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record an impairment charge for the difference between the carrying amount of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made. The testing of goodwill for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future performance and cash flows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including changes in economic, industry or market conditions, changes in business operations, future business operating performance, changes in competition or changes in technologies. Any changes in key assumptions or actual performance compared with key assumptions about our business and its future prospects or other assumptions could affect the fair value of one or more business segments, which may result in an impairment charge. Declines in projected operating cash flows in our Manufacturing or Plastics segments may result in goodwill impairments that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position, as well as financing agreement covenants.\nThe inability of our subsidiaries to provide sufficient earnings and cash flows to allow us to meet our financial obligations and debt covenants and pay dividends to our shareholders could have an adverse effect on the Company.\nOtter Tail Corporation is a holding company with no significant operations of its own. The primary source of funds for payment of our financial obligations and dividends to our shareholders is from cash provided by our subsidiary companies. Our ability to meet our financial obligations and pay dividends on our common stock principally depends on the actual and projected earnings, cash flows, capital requirements and general financial position of our subsidiary companies, as well as regulatory factors, financial covenants, general business conditions and other matters.\nUnder our $170 million revolving credit agreement we may not permit the ratio of our Interest-bearing Debt to Total Capitalization to be greater than 0.60 to 1.00. OTP may not permit the ratio of its Interest-bearing Debt to Total Capitalization to be greater than 0.60 to 1.00 under its $170 million revolving credit agreement. Both credit agreements contain restrictions on the payment of cash dividends on a default or event of default. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the debt covenants.\nUnder the Federal Power Act, a public utility may not pay dividends from any funds properly included in a capital account. What constitutes \u201cfunds properly included in a capital account\u201d is undefined in the Federal Power Act or the related regulations; however, the FERC has consistently interpreted the provision to allow dividends to be paid as long as (1) the source of the dividends is clearly disclosed, (2) the dividend is not excessive and (3) there is no self-dealing on the part of corporate officials. The MPUC indirectly limits the amount of dividends OTP can pay Otter Tail Corporation by requiring an equity-to-total-capitalization ratio between 46.0% and 56.2% based on OTP\u2019s 2019 capital structure petition. OTP\u2019s equity-to-total-capitalization ratio, including short-term debt, was 51.2% as of December 31, 2019.\nWhile these restrictions are not expected to affect our ability to pay dividends at the current level in the foreseeable future, there is no assurance that adverse financial results would not reduce or eliminate our ability to pay dividends.\nWe rely on our information systems to conduct our business, and failure to protect these systems against security breaches or cyber-attacks could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period, our business could be harmed.\nThe operation of our business is dependent on the secure function of our computer hardware and software systems. Furthermore, all our businesses require us to collect and maintain sensitive customer data, as well as confidential employee and shareholder information, which is subject to electronic theft or loss. We also use third-party vendors to electronically process certain of our business transactions. Information systems, both ours and those of third parties, are vulnerable to security breach by computer hackers and cyber terrorists, and the negligent or intentional breach of established controls and procedures or mismanagement of confidential information by employees. We may also be impacted by attacks and data security breaches of financial institutions, merchants or third-party processors. While we regularly conduct cybersecurity assessments, we cannot be certain our information security systems and protocols and those of our vendors and other third parties are sufficient to withstand a cyber-attack or other security breach.\nThe breach of certain business systems could affect our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information and transactions. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and repair security breaches or system damage and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to our reputation. For example, we may be subject to liability under various federal, state and international data protections laws. These laws are subject to change and expansion and may require additional operational changes to comply.\nThe misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data could lead to significant monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions and breach notification and mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring and result in reputational damage affecting relations with shareholders, customers and regulators. In addition to property and casualty insurance which may cover restoration of data, certain physical damage or third-party injuries, we have cybersecurity insurance related to a breach event. However, damage and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any available insurance.\nWe have cybersecurity processes and controls designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and systems and we and each of our operating companies have adopted disaster recovery plans. We have also adopted a number of security measures, practices, awareness and training programs as well as system processes to securely maintain confidential information. However, all these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches or cyber-attacks or enable us to recover effectively from such an attack. In addition, the unavailability of the information systems or failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason could disrupt our business and could result in decreased performance and increased overhead costs, causing our business and results of operations to suffer. Any significant interruption or failure of our information systems or any significant breach of security due to cyber-attacks, hacking or internal security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nLike many other companies, we have been the target of malicious cyber-attack attempts in the normal course of business. Although these prior cyber-attacks have been limited in scope, have not interrupted our business operations and have not had a material impact on our financial results, this may not continue to be the case in the future. Cybersecurity incidents involving businesses and other institutions are on the rise, we believe these incidents are likely to continue and we are unable to predict the direct or indirect impact of future attacks or breaches to our business.\nEconomic conditions could negatively impact our businesses.\nOur businesses are affected by local, national and worldwide economic conditions. Tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect the ability of customers to finance purchases of our goods and services, resulting in decreased orders, cancelled or deferred orders, slower payment cycles, and increased bad debt and customer bankruptcies. Our businesses may also be adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, such as decreases in business and consumer spending. A decline in the level of economic activity and uncertainty regarding energy and commodity prices could adversely affect our results of operations and our future growth.\nIf we are unable to achieve the organic growth we expect, our financial performance may be adversely affected.\nWe expect much of our growth in the next few years will come from major capital investment at existing companies. To achieve the organic growth we expect, we must have access to the capital markets, be successful with capital expansion programs related to organic growth, develop new products and services, expand our markets and increase efficiencies in our businesses. Competitive and economic factors could adversely affect our ability to do this. If we are unable to achieve and sustain consistent organic growth, we will be less likely to meet our earnings growth targets, which may adversely affect the market price of our common shares.\nOur plans to grow our businesses through capital projects, including infrastructure and new technology additions, or to grow or realign our businesses through acquisitions or dispositions may not be successful, which could result in poor financial performance.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to increase capital expenditures in our existing businesses and to continually assess our mix of businesses and potential strategic acquisitions or dispositions. We have a substantial capital investment program planned for the next five years including investments in renewables, a natural gas-fired plant, transmission assets and potential technology and infrastructure projects. Our ability to successfully and timely complete capital additions and improvements to existing facilities is contingent on many variables including availability and timely delivery of materials and components, which rely in part on a global markets, which markets could be subject to political crises, public health crises or other catastrophic events that are outside of our control. For example, in December 2019, a strain of coronavirus was reported to have occurred in Wuhan, China, resulting in certain manufacturing plants shuttering by government mandate. At this point, the extent to which the coronavirus may impact our capital projects is uncertain. There are also risks associated with capital expenditures including not being granted timely or full recovery of rate base additions in our regulated utility business, the inability to recover the cost of capital additions due to an economic downturn, not being granted timely approval of requested\ninterconnections to the transmission system for planned generation projects, unsuccessful implementation or delay in implementing new technology, lack of markets for new products, competition from producers of lower cost or alternative products, product defects, loss of customers, severe weather events, or other factors. We may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates or successfully negotiate, finance or integrate acquisitions. Future acquisitions could involve numerous risks including: difficulties in integrating the operations, services, products and personnel of the acquired business, and the potential loss of key employees, customers and suppliers of the acquired business. If we are unable to successfully manage these risks, we could face reductions in net income in future periods.\nWe may, from time to time, sell assets to provide capital to fund investments in our electric utility business or for other corporate purposes, which could result in the recognition of a loss on the sale of any assets sold and other potential liabilities. The sale of any of our businesses also exposes us to additional risks associated with indemnification obligations under the applicable sales agreements and any related disputes.\nAs part of our business strategy, we continually assess our business portfolio to determine if our operating companies continue to meet our portfolio criteria. A loss on the sale of a business would be recognized if a company is sold for less than its book value.\nIn certain transactions we retain obligations that have arisen, or subsequently arise, out of our conduct of the business prior to the sale. These obligations are sometimes direct or, in other cases, take the form of an indemnification obligation to the buyer. These obligations include such things as warranty, environmental, and the collection of certain receivables. Unforeseen costs related to these obligations could result in future losses related to the business sold.\nSignificant warranty claims and remediation costs in excess of amounts normally reserved for such items could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDepending on the specific product or service, we may provide certain warranty terms against manufacturing defects and certain materials. We reserve for warranty claims based on industry experience and estimates made by management. For some of our products we have limited history on which to base our warranty estimate. Our assumptions could be materially different from any actual claim and could exceed reserve balances.\nExpenses associated with the remediation of warranty claims for our current and former manufacturing businesses could be substantial. The potential exists for multiple claims based on one defect repeated throughout the production process or for claims where the cost to repair or replace the defective part is highly disproportionate to the original cost of the part. If we are required to cover remediation expenses in addition to our regular warranty coverage, we could be required to accrue additional expenses and experience additional unplanned cash expenditures which could adversely affect our consolidated net income and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with energy markets.\nOur businesses are subject to the risks associated with energy markets, including market supply and increasing energy prices. If we are faced with shortages in market supply, we may be unable to fulfill our contractual obligations to our retail, wholesale and other customers at previously anticipated costs. This could force us to obtain alternative energy or fuel supplies at higher costs or suffer increased liability for unfulfilled contractual obligations. Any significantly higher than expected energy or fuel costs would negatively affect our financial performance.\nChanges in tax laws, as well as judgments and estimates used in the determination of tax-related asset and liability amounts, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur provision for income taxes and reporting of tax-related assets and liabilities require significant judgments and the use of estimates. Amounts of tax-related assets and liabilities involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income, deductions and tax credits, including, but not limited to, estimates for potential adverse outcomes regarding tax positions that have been taken and the ability to utilize tax benefit carryforwards, such as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Actual income taxes could vary significantly from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of, among other things, changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations, the financial condition and results of operations of the Company, and the resolution of audit issues raised by taxing authorities. Ultimate resolution of income tax matters may result in material adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFour of our operating companies have single customers that provide a significant portion of the individual operating company\u2019s and the business segment\u2019s revenue. The loss of, or significant reduction in revenue from, any one of these customers would have a significant negative financial impact on the operating company and its business segment and could have a significant negative financial impact on the Company.\nWhile no single customer of the Company provides more than 10% of consolidated revenue, each of the Company\u2019s segments have large customers that provide over 10% of the operating company\u2019s and its segment\u2019s revenue. In 2019, one customer accounted for 12% of Electric segment revenue, two customers accounted for a total of 35% of Manufacturing segment revenue and two customers accounted for 46% of Plastics segment revenue. The loss of any one of these customers, or a significant decline in sales to these customers, would have a significant negative impact on the operating company\u2019s and its business segment\u2019s financial position and results of operations, and could have a significant negative impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nThe inability to attract and retain a qualified workforce including, but not limited to, executive officers, key employees and employees with specialized skills could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nThe success of our business heavily depends on the leadership of our executive officers and key employees to implement our strategy. The inability to attract and maintain a qualified workforce at all our operating companies may negatively affect our ability to service our customers, manufacture products, or successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives. Competition for skilled workers is high and can lead to increased labor expenses, decreased productivity and potentially lost business opportunities. Our ability to maintain productivity, relationships with customers, competitive costs, and quality services is limited by the ability to employ the necessary skilled personnel and could negatively affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nELECTRIC\nWe may experience fluctuations in revenues and expenses related to our electric operations, which may cause our financial results to fluctuate and could impair our ability to make distributions to shareholders or scheduled payments on our debt obligations, or to meet covenants under our borrowing agreements.\nSeveral factors, many of which are beyond our control, may contribute to fluctuations in our revenues and expenses from electric operations, causing our net income to fluctuate from period to period. These risks include fluctuations in the volume and price of sales of electricity to customers or other utilities, which may be affected by factors such as mergers and acquisitions of other utilities, geographic location of other utilities, transmission costs (including increased costs related to operations of regional transmission organizations), interconnection costs, generation curtailment, changes in the manner in which wholesale power is sold and purchased, unplanned interruptions at OTP\u2019s generating plants, the effects of regulation and legislation, demographic changes in OTP\u2019s customer base and changes in OTP\u2019s customer demand or load growth. Other risks include weather conditions or changes in weather patterns (including severe weather that could result in damage to OTP\u2019s assets), fuel and purchased power costs and the rate of economic growth or decline in OTP\u2019s service areas. A decrease in revenues or an increase in expenses related to our electric operations may reduce the amount of funds available for our existing and future utility business, which could result in increased financing requirements, impair our ability to make expected distributions to shareholders or impair our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations, or to meet covenants under our borrowing agreements.\nActions by the regulators of our electric operations could result in rate reductions, lower revenues and earnings or delays in recovering capital expenditures.\nWe are subject to federal and state legislation, government regulations and regulatory actions that may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. The electric rates that OTP is allowed to charge for its electric services are one of the most important items influencing our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. The rates OTP charges its electric customers are subject to review and determination by state public utility commissions in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota. OTP is also regulated by the FERC. Our ability to obtain rate adjustments to maintain reasonable rates of return depends on regulatory action under applicable statutes and regulations and we cannot provide assurance that rate adjustments will be obtained or reasonable authorized rates of return on capital will be earned. Also, there is no assurance the applicable regulatory authority will judge all our costs to have been prudently incurred or that rates will produce full recovery of such costs. In addition, there could be changes in the regulatory environment that would impair the ability of OTP to recover costs historically collected from their customers. OTP will file rate cases with, or seek cost recovery authorization from, federal and state regulatory authorities. An adverse decision by one or more regulatory authorities concerning the level or method of determining electric utility rates, the authorized returns on equity, recoverability of fuel and purchase power costs, approval of depreciation rates, implementation of enforceable federal reliability standards or other regulatory matters, permitted business activities (such as ownership or operation of nonelectric businesses) or any prolonged delay in rendering a decision in a rate or other proceeding (including with respect to the recovery of capital expenditures in rates) could result in lower revenues and net income.\nOTP\u2019s operations are subject to an extensive legal and regulatory framework under federal and state laws as well as regulations imposed by other organizations that may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to an extensive legal and regulatory framework imposed under federal and state law and regulatory agencies, including the FERC and the NERC. We could be subject to potential financial penalties for compliance violations. Our transmission systems and electric generation facilities are subject to the NERC mandatory reliability standards, including cybersecurity standards. If a serious reliability incident did occur, it could have a material effect on our operations or financial results. Some states have the authority to impose substantial penalties in the event of non-compliance. We attempt to mitigate the risk of regulatory penalties through formal training. However, there is no guarantee our compliance program will be sufficient to ensure against violations.\nIn addition, energy policy initiatives at the state or federal level could increase incentives for distributed generation or authorize municipal utility formation or acquisition of service territory, or local initiatives could introduce generation or distribution requirements that could change the current integrated utility model.\nThese laws and regulations significantly influence our operations and may affect our ability to recover costs from our customers. We are required to have numerous permits, licenses, approvals and certificates from the agencies and other organizations that regulate our business. We believe we have obtained the necessary approvals for our existing operations and that our business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws and regulatory requirements; however, we are unable to predict the impact on our operating results from the future regulatory activities of any of these agencies and other organizations. Changes in regulations or the imposition of additional regulations could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOTP\u2019s electric transmission and generation facilities could be vulnerable to cyber and physical attack that could impair our ability to provide electrical service to our customers or disrupt the U.S. bulk power system.\nOTP owns electric transmission and generation facilities subject to mandatory and enforceable standards advanced by the NERC. These bulk electric system facilities provide the framework for the electrical infrastructure of OTP\u2019s service territory and interconnected systems, the operation of which is dependent on information technology systems. Further, the information systems that operate OTP\u2019s electric system are interconnected to external networks. Parties that wish to disrupt the U.S. bulk power system or OTP\u2019s operations could view OTP\u2019s computer systems, software or networks as attractive targets for cyber-attack.\nIn addition, OTP\u2019s generation and transmission facilities are spread throughout a large service territory. These facilities could be subject to physical attack or vandalism that could disrupt OTP\u2019s operations or conceivably the regional or U.S. bulk power system.\nOTP is subject to mandatory cybersecurity and physical security regulatory requirements. OTP implements the NERC standards for operating its transmission and generation assets and stays abreast of best practices within business and the utility industry to protect its computers and computer-controlled systems from outside attack. We rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information necessary for the operation of our systems. In an effort to reduce the likelihood and severity of cyber intrusions, we have cybersecurity processes and controls and disaster recovery plans designed to protect and preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and systems. We also take prudent and reasonable steps to protect the physical security of our generation and transmission facilities. The FERC has approved Version 5 of the Critical Infrastructure Protection Cybersecurity Standards. The standards require us to categorize our cyber assets as high, medium and low impact. As of December 31, 2019, all these cyber assets were in compliance with the standard. However, all these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches or cyber-attacks or enable us to recover effectively from such a breach or attack. Any significant interruption or failure of our information systems or any significant breach of security due to cyber-attacks, hacking or internal security breaches or physical attack of our generation or transmission facilities could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nLike many other companies, we have been the target of malicious cyber-attack attempts in the normal course of business. Although these prior cyber-attacks have been limited in scope, have not interrupted our business operations and have not had a material impact on our financial results, this may not continue to be the case in the future. Cybersecurity incidents involving businesses and other institutions are on the rise, we believe these incidents are likely to continue and we are unable to predict the direct or indirect impact of future attacks or breaches to our business.\nOTP\u2019s electric generating facilities are subject to operational risks that could result in early closure, unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.\nOperation of electric generating facilities involves risks which can adversely affect energy output and efficiency levels. OTP relies on a limited number of suppliers of coal, making it vulnerable to increased prices for fuel as existing contracts expire or in the event of unanticipated interruptions in fuel supply. There can be no assurance suppliers will fulfill their obligations to provide coal. Certain of our former coal suppliers have filed bankruptcy proceedings in the past which did not materially affect our operations. Our current suppliers could experience financial issues, operational problems or other circumstances, such as severe weather or natural disaster that inhibit their ability to fulfill their obligations. OTP is a captive rail shipper of the BNSF Railway for shipments of coal to its Big Stone and Hoot Lake plants, making it vulnerable to increased prices for coal transportation from a sole supplier and disruptions in coal deliveries due to rail line congestion and constraints or extreme weather conditions that could impact the rail lines between the coal source mines and the plants. If OTP were unable to obtain its coal requirements under existing coal supply and transportation contracts it could be required to purchase coal at higher prices or forced to purchase electricity from higher-cost generation resources in the MISO energy market. Higher fuel prices result in higher electric rates for OTP\u2019s retail customers through fuel clause adjustments and could make it less competitive in wholesale electric markets. In addition, regulatory authorities could disallow recovery of the increased fuel or purchase power costs.\nOperational risks also include facility shutdowns due to breakdown or failure of equipment or processes, labor disputes, operator error, and catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, floods, intentional acts of destruction or other similar occurrences, as well as risk of performance below expected levels of output or efficiency affecting OTP\u2019s electric generating facilities. We could be subject to costs associated with any unexpected failure to produce or deliver power, including failure caused by a breakdown or forced outage, as well as repairing damage to facilities.\nEarly closure of a generating facility due to operational or economic factors, environmental regulation or risks or litigation could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. We would be obligated to pay for costs of closure of our share of generation facilities. If recovery of our remaining investment in such facilities and the costs associated with early closure, including decommissioning, remediation, reclamation and restoration are not recovered from customers, it could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nThe loss of a major generating facility would require OTP to identify and receive approval for other sources of generation for its customers, if available, and expose it to higher purchased power costs. In addition, OTP may not be able to obtain timely regulatory approval for new generation resources to replace closed facilities.\nRegulation of generating plant emissions could affect our operating costs and the costs of supplying electricity to our customers and the economic viability of continued operation of certain of OTP\u2019s steam-powered electric plants.\nIn recent years, federal, state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, or GHGs. The EPA has finalized a series of GHG monitoring, reporting and emissions control rules for certain large sources of GHGs, and Congress has, from time to time, considered adopting legislation to reduce GHG emissions. Numerous states have already taken measures to reduce GHG emissions, primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. While the current administration has announced that the United States will withdraw from international commitments to reduce GHG emissions, many state and local officials have announced their decisions to uphold such commitments.\nExisting or new laws or regulations passed or issued by federal or state authorities addressing climate change or reductions of GHG emissions, such as mandated levels of renewable generation, mandatory reductions in CO2 emission levels, taxes on CO2 emissions or cap-and-trade regimes, could require us to incur significant new costs, which could negatively impact our net income, financial position and operating cash flows if such costs cannot be recovered through rates granted by ratemaking authorities in the states where OTP provides service or through increased market prices for electricity.\nIn certain circumstances, it may not be economically viable to install and operate pollution control equipment at older generation facilities in order to bring them into compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including state implementation plans for the RHR. In those circumstances, it may be necessary to pursue replacement electric generation facilities as an alternative, which may require incurring significant investment in new facilities and recording significant asset impairment charges relating to closed facilities, in addition to obtaining necessary regulatory permits and approvals.\nThe final version of the ACE Rule, which went into effect on September 6, 2019, establishes guidelines for states to use in developing plans to address GHG emissions from existing coal-fired power plants. The ACE Rule established heat rate improvements as the best system of emissions reduction for CO2 from existing coal-fired generation units. States will establish unit-specific standards of performance that reflect the emission limitation achievable through certain candidate heat-rate improvement technologies. States have until mid-2022 to submit a state implementation plan to the EPA for approval. We cannot predict the impact of the ACE Rule on us until the state plans are adopted and any judicial reviews are completed, but it could be material to the Company.\nState implementation of pollution control plans to improve visibility and air quality at national parks under the EPA\u2019s RHR could require us to incur significant new costs, which could, dependent on determinations by state regulatory commissions on approval to recover such costs from customers, negatively impact our net income, financial position and cash flows. OTP understands that the NDDEQ intends to require sources subject to RHR Round 2 reasonable progress determinations, including Coyote Station, to undertake emissions control measures that are reasonably consistent with those required of sources during Round 1. While this process is still in the early stages, if the NDDEQ maintains its initial position, OTP anticipates that significant emissions controls would be required at Coyote Station by December 31, 2028 in order to maintain compliance with the RHR. Plans are due to be submitted to the EPA by July 2021. OTP expects the NDDEQ to begin drafting a state implementation plan in mid-2020. In light of the costs for such emissions control equipment, there are scenarios where it may not be economically feasible to invest in such equipment and an early retirement of the Coyote Station would therefore be necessary. The costs related to an early retirement of Coyote Station would be material to OTP and the Company and would be subject to state commission approval for recovery from customers.\nThe long-range planning required for transmission and generation projects creates risks of increased costs and lower returns on investment when the project is finally completed.\nElectric transmission and generation projects are planned years in advance of when they are placed in service based on resource plans using assumptions over the planning period. These assumptions include sales growth, commodity prices, equipment and construction costs, regulatory treatment, technology and public policy. Changes in critical planning assumptions could result in excess generation, transmission and distribution resources which increase cost per customer. These changes could also result in stranded investments if the utility is not able to fully recover the cost of the investment.\nMANUFACTURING\nCompetition from foreign and domestic manufacturers, the price and availability of raw materials, trade policy and tariffs affecting prices and markets for raw material and manufactured products, prices and supply of scrap or recyclable material and general economic conditions could affect the revenues and earnings of our manufacturing businesses.\nOur manufacturing businesses are subject to intense risks associated with competition from foreign and domestic manufacturers, many of whom have broader product lines, greater distribution capabilities, greater capital resources, larger marketing, research and development staffs and facilities and other capabilities that may place downward pressure on margins and profitability. The companies in our Manufacturing segment use a variety of raw materials in the products they manufacture, including steel, aluminum and polystyrene and other plastics resins. Costs for these items can fluctuate significantly. Federal trade policies, including imposed and proposed tariffs could significantly increase the prices and delivery of raw materials such as steel and aluminum that are critical to the manufacturing businesses. If our manufacturing businesses are not able to pass on cost increases to their customers, it could have a negative effect on profit margins in our Manufacturing segment. Additionally, a certain amount of residual material (scrap) is a by-product of the manufacturing and production processes used by our manufacturing companies. Declines in commodity prices for these scrap materials due to weakened demand or excess supply, can negatively impact the profitability of our manufacturing companies as it reduces their ability to mitigate the cost associated with excess material. Changes in macroeconomic conditions can negatively impact demand in the end-use markets for products and parts that we manufacture, resulting in reduced sales and profits. There is no assurance the initiatives underway to increase revenues and improve margins at our manufacturing businesses will be successful.\nEconomic conditions in the industries in which our customers operate can have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur manufacturing businesses derive a large amount of their net sales from customers in the following industry sectors: recreational vehicle/powersports, lawn and garden, construction, agriculture, energy, horticultural and life science. Factors affecting any of these industries in general, or any of our customers in particular, could adversely affect us because our net sales growth largely depends on the continued growth of our customers\u2019 businesses in their respective industries. These factors include:\n\u25cf\nseasonality of demand for our customers\u2019 products which may cause our manufacturing capacity to be underutilized for periods of time;\n\u25cf\nour customers\u2019 failure to successfully market their products, to gain or retain widespread commercial acceptance of their products or to compete effectively in their industries;\n\u25cf\nloss of market share for our customers\u2019 products, which may lead our customers to reduce or discontinue purchasing our products and components and to reduce prices, thereby exerting pricing pressure on us;\n\u25cf\neconomic conditions in the markets in which our customers operate, in particular, the United States, including recessionary periods such as a global economic downturn;\n\u25cf\nour customers\u2019 decision to insource the production of components that has traditionally been outsourced to us; and\n\u25cf\nproduct design changes or manufacturing process changes that may reduce or eliminate demand for the components we supply.\nWe expect future sales will continue to depend on the success of our customers. If economic conditions or demand for our customers\u2019 products deteriorate, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business and operating results may be adversely affected if we are not able to maintain our manufacturing, engineering and technological expertise.\nThe markets for our manufacturing businesses are characterized by changing technology and evolving process development. The continued success of our businesses will depend on our ability to:\n\u25cf\nhire, retain and expand our pool of qualified engineering and trade-skilled personnel;\n\u25cf\nmaintain technological leadership in our industry;\n\u25cf\nimplement new and expand on current robotics, automation and tooling technologies; and\n\u25cf\nanticipate or respond to changes in manufacturing processes in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nWe may not be able to develop the capabilities required by our customers in the future. The emergence of new technologies, industry standards or customer requirements may render our equipment, inventory or processes obsolete or uncompetitive. We may have to acquire new technologies and equipment to remain competitive. The acquisition and implementation of new technologies and equipment may require us to incur significant expense and capital investment, which could reduce our margins and affect our operating results. When we establish or acquire new facilities, we may not be able to maintain or develop our manufacturing, engineering and technological expertise due to a lack of trained personnel, effective training of new staff or technical difficulties with machinery. Failure to anticipate and adapt to customers\u2019 changing technological needs and requirements, to hire and retain a sufficient number of engineers, and to maintain manufacturing, engineering and technological expertise may have a material adverse effect on our businesses and operating results.\nOur manufacturing, painting and coating operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that could result in liabilities to us.\nOur manufacturing, painting and coating operations are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing discharges to air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances, the cleanup of contaminated sites and health and safety matters. We could incur material costs, including cleanup costs, civil and criminal fines, penalties and third-party claims for cost recovery, property damage or personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under such laws and regulations. The ultimate cost of remediating contaminated sites, if any, is difficult to accurately predict and could exceed estimates. In addition, as environmental, health and safety laws and regulations have tended to become stricter, we could incur additional costs complying with requirements that are promulgated in the future.\nPLASTICS\nOur plastics operations are highly dependent on a limited number of vendors for PVC resin and a limited supply of PVC resin. The loss of a key vendor, or any interruption or delay in the supply of PVC resin, could result in reduced sales or increased costs for our plastics business.\nWe rely on a limited number of vendors to supply the PVC resin used in our plastics business. Two vendors provided over 99% of our total purchases of PVC resin in 2019 and 2018. In addition, the supply of PVC resin may be limited primarily due to manufacturing capacity and the limited availability of raw material components. Most U.S. resin production plants are located in the Gulf Coast region, which may increase the risk of a shortage of resin in the event of a hurricane or other natural disaster in that region. The loss of a key vendor or any interruption or delay in the availability or supply of PVC resin could disrupt our ability to deliver our plastic products, cause customers to cancel orders or require us to incur additional expenses to obtain PVC resin from alternative sources, if such sources are available.\nWe compete against many other manufacturers of PVC pipe and manufacturers of alternative products. Customers may not distinguish our products from those of our competitors.\nThe plastic pipe industry is fragmented and competitive due to the number of producers and the fungible nature of the product. We compete not only against other plastic pipe manufacturers, but also against ductile iron, steel and concrete pipe manufacturers. Due to shipping costs, competition is usually regional instead of national in scope, and the principal areas of competition are a combination of price, service, warranty, and product performance. Our inability to compete effectively in each of these areas and to distinguish our plastic pipe products from competing products may adversely affect the financial performance of our plastics business.\nChanges in PVC resin prices can negatively affect our plastics business.\nThe PVC pipe industry is highly sensitive to commodity raw material pricing volatility. Historically, when resin prices are rising or stable, margins and sales volume have been higher and when resin prices are falling, sales volumes and margins have been lower. Changes in PVC resin prices can negatively affect PVC pipe prices, profit margins on PVC pipe sales and the value of our finished goods inventory.", "PERMNO": 60098, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "OTTR"}
