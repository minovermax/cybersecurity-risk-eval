RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully read the risk factors set forth below, together with the financial statements, related notes and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business is subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, some of which are described below. The risks described below, however, are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. Any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Please refer to the discussion of \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d on page one of this Annual Report on Form 10-K in connection with your consideration of the risk factors and other important factors that may affect future results described below.\nWe have incurred significant losses in prior periods and may incur losses in the future.\nWe have incurred significant losses in prior periods and may continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. These losses may have an adverse effect on our ability to attract new customers or retain existing customers. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $312.3 million. While we had net income of $38.1 million in 2011 and $29.1 million in 2010, we incurred net losses of $62.9 million, $77.8 million, $44.0 million, $30.4 million and $5.5 million in 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient revenue growth to achieve profitability in future periods.\nWe are exploring, evaluating and have begun implementing alternatives with a goal of providing greater value to our stockholders. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying additional alternatives or implementing any alternative, or that any alternative will yield additional value for stockholders.\nOur management and Board of Directors are continuing to review alternatives with a goal of providing greater value to our stockholders. These alternatives could result in, among other things, modifying or eliminating certain of our operations, selling material assets or business segments, seeking additional financing, selling the business, effecting a merger, consolidation or other business combination, partnering or other collaboration agreements, or potential acquisitions or recapitalizations, in one or more transactions. In connection with the Board of Directors\u2019 continuing review of alternatives, on September 12, 2016, the Board of Directors determined to shut down production activities and close our facility in Penang, Malaysia, and to sell our assets relating to the Malaysian operations. Production activities at the Malaysia facility have ceased. Also on September 12, 2016, we announced the Board of Directors\u2019 decision to limit our focus on the optical and industrial sapphire markets and to exit the LED and mobile device markets. In the fourth quarter 2016, we developed a plan to scale down our U.S. operations. We evaluated our U.S. asset portfolio for the assets continuing to be used in operations and determined there were excess U.S. assets that we intend to sell. There is no assurance that we will be able to successfully expand our optical and industrial sapphire business or that we will obtain market acceptance for any new product offerings in these markets. There is no assurance that we will be able to sell our assets in Malaysia or the U.S. at prices favorable to us, or at all. Additionally, there can be no assurance that our continued exploration of alternatives will result in the identification of additional alternatives or that any transaction will be consummated. The process of exploring alternatives may be costly and may be time consuming, distracting to management and disruptive to our business operations. If we are unable to effectively manage the process, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We also cannot provide assurance that any potential transaction or other alternative identified, evaluated and consummated, will provide greater value to our stockholders than that reflected in the current stock price. Any potential transaction would be dependent upon a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other factors, market conditions, industry trends, the interest of third parties in our business and the availability of financing to us or potential buyers on reasonable terms.\nWe may acquire other businesses, products or technologies; if we do, we may be unable to integrate them with our business effectively or at all, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we find appropriate opportunities and have adequate funding, we may acquire other businesses, product lines or technologies. However, if we acquire a business, product line or technology, the process of integration may produce unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures and may absorb significant attention of our management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business. Further, the acquisition of a business may result in the assumption of unknown liabilities or create risks with respect to our existing relationships with suppliers and customers. If we make acquisitions, we may issue shares of stock that dilute other stockholders, expend cash, incur debt, assume contingent liabilities or create additional expenses related to amortizing intangible assets, any of which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nIf we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, we may not be able to execute our business plan and may be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product research and development programs or delay the introduction of new products or the acquisition of other businesses.\nWe may require additional capital to fund operations, capital expenditures, additional product research and development efforts, and the introduction of new products or acquisition of other businesses. We may finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations or licensing arrangements. Additional funds may not be available when we\nneed them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our product research and development programs or acquisition opportunities. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience dilution, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants. To the extent that we raise additional funds through corporate collaborations or licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies or our new products or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. We may seek to access the public or private capital markets whenever conditions are favorable, even if we do not have an immediate need for additional capital at that time. Introducing newly developed products to the market often requires investment before revenue is generated from those products. We currently have no commitments or arrangements for any additional financing to fund our product research and development programs. However, we may need to raise substantial additional capital in the future to complete the development and commercialization of our new products or to acquire new businesses or technology.\nWe believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and interest thereon, will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, if our success in generating sufficient operating cash flow or our use of cash in the next twelve months were to significantly adversely change, we may not have enough funds available to continue operating at our current level in future periods. A limitation of funds available may raise concerns about our ability to continue to operate. Such concerns may limit our ability to obtain financing and some customers may not be willing to do business with us.\nOur future funding requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe amount and growth rate of our revenues and ability to be operationally cash flow positive;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies;\n\u2022\nthe level of capital expenditures required to maintain or expand our operations;\n\u2022\nthe initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of studies and trials required for our new products;\n\u2022\nthe number and characteristics of new products that we pursue;\n\u2022\nthe terms and timing of any future collaboration, licensing or other arrangements that we may establish;\n\u2022\nthe cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments; and\n\u2022\nthe cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any new products.\nWe rely on third parties for certain finishing steps for our products, including the slicing and polishing of our sapphire crystal.\nIn order to reduce product costs and improve cash flow, we use third parties for certain finishing functions for our products, including the slicing and polishing of our sapphire crystal inventory. These types of services are only available from a limited number of third parties. Our ability to successfully outsource these finishing functions will substantially depend on our ability to develop, maintain and expand our strategic relationship with these third parties. Any impairment in our relationships with the third parties performing these functions, in the absence of a timely and satisfactory alternative arrangement, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. In addition, we do not control any of these third parties or the operation of their facilities, and we may not be able to adequately manage and oversee the third parties performing our finishing functions. Accordingly, any difficulties encountered by these third parties that result in product defects, delays or defaults on their contractual commitments to us could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, their facilities may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, inclement weather conditions, power loss, acts of terrorism and similar events. A decision to close a facility without adequate notice as a result of these or other unanticipated problems at the facility could result in lengthy interruptions in their services to us; and any loss or interruption of these services could significantly increase our expenses, cause us to default on our obligations to our customers and/or otherwise adversely affect our business. Furthermore, the outsourcing of our finishing steps, such as slicing and polishing of wafers, may not continue to be available at reasonable prices or on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nOur gross margins could fluctuate as a result of changes in our product mix and other factors, which may adversely impact our operating results.\nWe anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate from period to period as a result of the mix of products that we sell in any given period. We are working to increase sales of higher margin products, introduce new differentiated products and lower our costs. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in improving our gross margin mix. If we are not successful, our overall gross margin levels and operating results in future periods would continue to be adversely impacted. Increased competition and the adoption of alternatives to our products, more complex engineering requirements, lower demand and other factors may lead to a further downward shift in our product margins, leading to price erosion and lower revenues for us in the future.\nThe markets in which we operate are very competitive, and many of our competitors and potential competitors are larger, more established and better capitalized than we are.\nThe markets for selling high-quality sapphire products are very competitive and have been characterized by rapid technological change. This competition could result in increased pricing pressure, reduced profit margins, increased sales and marketing expenses, and failure to increase, or the loss of, market share or expected market share, any of which would likely seriously harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSome of our competitors and potential competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. Given their capital resources, the large companies with which we compete, or may compete in the future, are in a better position to substantially increase their manufacturing capacity and research and development efforts or to withstand any significant reduction in orders by customers in our markets. Such larger companies typically have broader product lines and market focus and thus are not as susceptible to downturns in a particular market. Some of our competitors also receive government subsidies, which could create a competitive advantage. We would be at a competitive disadvantage if our competitors bring their products to market earlier, if their products are more technologically capable than ours, or if any of our competitors\u2019 products or technologies becomes preferred in the industry. Moreover, we cannot assure you that existing or potential customers will not develop their own products, or acquire companies with products that are competitive with our products. Any of these competitive threats could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nThe average selling prices of sapphire products have historically been volatile and in recent years sapphire product prices have been increasingly depressed.\nHistorically, our industry has experienced volatility in product demand and pricing. However, in the last three years, the sales prices for our sapphire products have trended downward due to an over-supply of products in the market. In some countries, government programs support sapphire producers who would otherwise be unprofitable; in such circumstances, sapphire may be sold at prices below cost for an extended period of time, depressing market prices, to the detriment of our gross margins. This has had a significant adverse impact on our profitability and our results of operations. Moreover, changes in average selling prices of our products as a result of competitive pricing pressures increased sales discounts and new product introductions by our competitors could have a significant impact on our profitability. Although we attempt to optimize our product mix, introduce new products, reduce manufacturing costs and pass along certain increases in costs to our customers in order to lessen the effect of decreases in selling prices, we may not be able to successfully do so in a timely manner or at all, and our results of operations and business may be harmed.\nWe rely on a limited number of outsource providers and suppliers for raw materials and key components.\nFrom time to time, we depend on a small number of suppliers for certain raw materials, components, services and equipment used in manufacturing our products. We generally purchase these items with purchase orders, and we have no guaranteed supply arrangements with such suppliers. We also outsource some of our production processes. We are subject to variations in the cost of these goods and services from period to period. We do not control the time and resources that these suppliers or service providers devote to our business, and we cannot be sure that these suppliers or service providers will perform their obligations to us or do so on a timely basis. In addition, some of these third parties are located in regions of the world that may experience periods of political or economic instability, which could inhibit their ability to supply necessary materials or services to us.\nAny significant delay in product delivery or production processes, or other interruption or variation in supply or services from our key suppliers and providers could prevent us from meeting demand for our products and from obtaining future business. If we were to lose key suppliers or service providers or if they were unable to support our demand, our manufacturing operations could be interrupted and we could be required to attempt to establish supply arrangements with other suppliers or service providers. In addition, the inability of our suppliers to support our demand could be indicative of a market wide scarcity of materials, which could result in even longer or deeper interruptions. Any such delay or interruption would impair our ability to meet our customers\u2019 needs and, therefore, could damage our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nOur future operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results for particular periods to fall below expectations.\nOur revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations are due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. In connection with the Board of Directors\u2019 continuing review of alternatives with a goal of providing greater value to our stockholders, on September 12, 2016, we announced the Board\u2019s decision to limit our business focus to the optical and industrial sapphire markets and to exit the LED and mobile device markets. The optical and industrial sapphire markets are smaller markets than our historical undertakings and there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully expand our optical and industrial sapphire business, or that such shift in focus will ultimately improve our profitability or operating results. Our annual revenue from optical and industrial products over the past three years has been between $4.5 million and $7.1 million, representing 15% to 23% of our total revenue in those years.\nSome of the factors that will affect operating results include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of costs relating to the expansion of our operations in the optical and industrial markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new customers;\n\u2022\ngain or loss of significant customers;\n\u2022\ntiming and size of orders from and shipments to customers;\n\u2022\nvolatility of sapphire product prices;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop, introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nour ability to meet customer specifications for products;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our optical and industrial sapphire products and our customers\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain key relationships with suppliers and contractor third parties, including for the slicing and polishing functions for our sapphire crystal;\n\u2022\nperformance of suppliers, contractors and other third parties on whom we depend;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in gross margins as a result of changes in capacity utilization, raw material costs, product mix or other factors;\n\u2022\nour ability to reduce costs commensurate to our scaled down operations;\n\u2022\nthe need to pay higher labor costs;\n\u2022\ncompetitive market conditions, including pricing actions by our competitors and our customers\u2019 competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of technological innovations, new products or upgrades to existing products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel, which could be affected by our recent announcements to shift our business focus and consolidate our operations;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions in the optical and industrial sapphire markets;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in trade secrets, patent or other proprietary rights by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ninterruption of operations at our manufacturing facilities or the facilities of our suppliers;\n\u2022\nrapid changes in market conditions that result in financial hardship for some or all of our customers, resulting in reduced orders and/or accounts receivable write-offs in the future;\n\u2022\npotential seasonal fluctuations in our customers\u2019 business activities; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, such as floods, hurricanes and earthquakes, as well as interruptions in power supply resulting from such events or due to other causes.\nThe foregoing factors are difficult to forecast, and these, as well as other factors, could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results. Likewise, if we acquire any new business, whether or not in the sapphire market, the operating results of that business will be subject to the same risks as are listed above. If our revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or any securities analysts that may publish research on our Company, the price of our common stock would likely decline.\nWe depend on a few customers for a major portion of our sales and our results of operations would be adversely impacted if they reduce their order volumes.\nHistorically, we have earned, and believe that in the future we will continue to earn, a substantial portion of our revenue from a small number of customers. In 2016 our top customer accounted for approximately 60% of our revenue and in 2015 our top two customers accounted for approximately 31% of our revenue. Our revenue from the optical and industrial markets also tends to be concentrated, with three customers accounting for approximately 19%, 13%, and 11% of the optical revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 and four customers accounting for approximately 20%, 14%, 10% and 10% of the optical revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. If we were to lose one of our major customers or have a major customer significantly reduce its volume of business with us, our revenues and profitability would be materially reduced unless we are able to replace such demand with other orders promptly. We expect to continue to be dependent on our major customers, the number and identity of which may change from period to period.\nWe generally sell our products on the basis of purchase orders. Thus, most of our customers could cease purchasing our products with little or no notice and without significant penalties. In addition, delays in product orders could cause our quarterly revenue to vary significantly. A number of factors could cause our customers to cancel or defer orders, including interruptions to their operations due to a downturn in their industries, natural disasters, delays in manufacturing their own product offerings into which our products are incorporated, securing other sources for the products that we manufacture or developing such products internally.\nOur products must meet exacting specifications and undetected defects may cause customers to return or stop buying our products.\nOur customers establish demanding specifications for quality, performance and reliability that our products must meet. While we inspect our products before shipment, they still may contain undetected defects. If defects occur in our products, we could experience lost revenue, increased costs, delays in, or cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments, product returns or discounts, or damage to our reputation, any of which would harm our operating results and our business.\nIf the market acceptance of newly developed products does not meet our expectations or our efforts to enhance existing products are not successful, our future operating results may be harmed.\nThe development of new products may require substantial investment in development efforts. If our newly developed products do not achieve market acceptance, we may be unable to generate anticipated revenue and our operating results could be harmed.\nOur continuing efforts to enhance our current products and to develop new products involve several risks, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changes in customer requirements;\n\u2022\nthe significant research and development investment that we may be required to make before market acceptance of a particular new or enhanced product;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that the industry may not accept our new or enhanced products after we have invested a significant amount of resources in development; and\n\u2022\ncompetition from new technologies, processes and products introduced by our current and/or future competitors.\nIf we are unable to attract or retain qualified personnel, our business and product development efforts could be harmed.\nOur success depends on our continued ability to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial, manufacturing, administrative and sales and marketing personnel. Competition for these individuals is intense, and we may not be able to successfully recruit, assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. In particular, we may encounter difficulties in recruiting and retaining a sufficient number of qualified technical personnel. The inability to attract and retain necessary technical, managerial, manufacturing, administrative and sales and marketing personnel could harm our ability to obtain new customers and develop new products and could adversely affect our business and operating results. In addition, the loss of the services, or distraction, of our senior management for any reason could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks from international sales that may harm our operating results.\nIn 2016 and 2015, revenue from international sales for our optical and industrial markets products was approximately 35% and 28%, respectively, of our total optical and industrial markets revenue. We expect that revenue from international sales will continue to be a portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future. Our international sales are subject to a variety of additional risks, including risks arising from:\n\u2022\nsales variability as a result of transacting our foreign sales in U.S. dollars as prices for our products become less competitive in countries with currencies that are low or are declining in value against the U.S. dollar and more competitive in countries with currencies that are high or increasing in value against the U.S. dollar;\n\u2022\ntrading restrictions, tariffs, trade barriers and taxes;\n\u2022\ndiffering intellectual property laws;\n\u2022\neconomic and political risks, wars, acts of terrorism, political unrest, pandemics, boycotts, curtailments of trade and other business restrictions;\n\u2022\nthe difficulty of enforcing contracts and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses; and\n\u2022\nperiodic foreign economic downturns.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international sales. Our failure to manage any of these risks could harm our operating results.\nOur gross margins and profitability may be adversely affected by energy costs.\nMost of our power consumption takes place in our crystal growth facility in the U.S. Electricity prices could increase due to overall changes to the price of energy due to conditions in the Middle East, natural gas shortages in the U.S. and other economic conditions and uncertainties regarding the outcome and implications of such events. Once our current purchase agreements expire, if electricity prices increase significantly, we may not be able to pass these price increases through to our customers on a timely basis, if at all, which could adversely affect our gross margins and results of operations.\nOur contracts for electricity require us to purchase certain minimum amounts in order to retain the pricing under the contract. If the amount we use is less than the required minimum, the difference is resold at the then prevailing market price and, if the resale price is lower than our contract price, we will experience a loss on that resale, which could adversely affect our gross margins and operating results.\nOur manufacturing processes may be interrupted or our production may be delayed if we or our outsource providers cannot maintain sufficient electrical supply, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur manufacturing process requires a stable source of electricity. From time to time, we have experienced limited disruptions in our supply of electricity. Such disruptions, depending upon their duration, could result in a significant drop in throughput and yield of in-process crystal boules and create delays in our production. Although we use generators and other back-up sources of electricity, these replacement sources of electricity are only capable of providing effective back-up for limited periods of time. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in avoiding future disruptions in power or in mitigating the effects of such disruptions. Any material disruption in electrical supply could delay our production and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, we outsource some of the finishing steps for our products and any interruption in the operations of third parties to whom we outsource could adversely impact our ability to deliver certain products. Such an interruption could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur proprietary intellectual property rights may not adequately protect our products and technologies, and the failure to protect such rights could harm our competitive position and adversely affect our operating results.\nTo protect our technology, we have chosen to rely primarily on trade secrets and to a lesser extent publicly filed patents. Trade secrets are inherently difficult to protect. While we believe we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our directors, employees, consultants or contractors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors, whether during or after the termination of their services to our Company. If we were to seek to enforce a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, it would be expensive and time consuming, and the outcome would be unpredictable.\nIn addition, courts outside the U.S. are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets than U.S. courts. Moreover, if our competitors independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how, it will be more difficult for us to protect our intellectual property and our business could be harmed.\nWe have seven issued patents covering our products and technologies and twenty-two patent applications pending. There can be no assurance that our pending patents will be issued or that any patents issued will be of significant value to our business. Our commercial success will depend on obtaining and maintaining trade secret, patent and other intellectual property protection of our products and technologies. We will only be able to protect products and technologies from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid, protectable and enforceable trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights cover them.\nIf we are not able to defend the trade secret or patent protection positions of our products and technologies, then we may not be able to successfully compete with competitors developing or marketing competing products and we may not generate enough revenue from product sales to justify the cost of development of our products and to achieve or maintain profitability.\nThe protection of our intellectual property rights and the defense of claims of infringement against us by third parties may subject us to costly litigation.\nOther companies might allege that we are infringing certain of their patents or other rights. If we are unable to resolve these matters satisfactorily, or to obtain licenses on acceptable terms, we may face litigation. Any litigation to enforce patents issued to us, to protect trade secrets or know-how possessed by us or to defend us or indemnify others against claimed infringement of the rights of others could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Regardless of the validity or successful outcome of any such intellectual property claims, we may need to expend significant time and expense to protect our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on us. If we lose any such litigation where we are alleged to infringe the rights of others, we may be required to:\n\u2022\npay substantial damages;\n\u2022\nseek licenses from others; or\n\u2022\nchange, or stop manufacturing or selling, some or all of our products.\nAny of these outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may be subject to confidential information theft or misuse, which could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems on which we maintain proprietary and other confidential information. Our security measures may be breached as the result of industrial or other espionage actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our systems. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to access our confidential information through other means, for example by fraudulently inducing our employees to disclose confidential information. We actively seek to prevent, detect and investigate any unauthorized access, which sometimes occurs. We might be unaware of any such access or unable to determine its magnitude and effects. The theft and/or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position and the value of our investment in research and development could be reduced. Our business could be subject to significant disruption and we could suffer monetary or other losses.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, which could expose us to environmental liabilities, increase our manufacturing and related compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIn our manufacturing process, we use water, oils, slurries, acids, adhesives and other industrial chemicals. We are subject to a variety of foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. These environmental laws and regulations include those relating to the use, storage, handling, discharge, emission, disposal and reporting of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous materials used in our manufacturing processes. These materials may have been or could be released into the environment at properties currently or previously operated by us, at other locations during the transport of the materials, or at properties to which we send substances for treatment or disposal. If we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws and regulations or become non-compliant with permits required at some of our facilities, we could be held financially responsible and incur substantial costs, including investigation and cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damages or personal injury claims. In addition, new laws and regulations or stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations could give rise to additional compliance costs and liabilities.\nPotential changes in trade relations or fiscal and tax policies implemented by the new presidential administration could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nRevenue from international sales constitutes a material portion of our total revenue and we anticipate it will continue to for the foreseeable future. The recent presidential election has created uncertainty with respect to trade relations between the United Sates and many of its trade partners. The current administration has suggested that it is not supportive of certain existing international trade agreements. At this time, it remains unclear what actions may be taken with respect to these international trade agreements. If the United States takes action to withdraw from or materially modify certain international trade agreements, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, if tariffs or other restrictions are imposed on products imported from countries in which we make sales, or relations with such countries otherwise deteriorate, such countries could retaliate by imposing similar tariffs or restrictions on products imported into those countries and it could cause negative sentiments toward the United States by our customers in those countries, either of which could result in the loss of customers and revenue from international sales. If our revenues generated from international sales decline significantly, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe new administration has also called for substantial change to fiscal and tax policies, which may include comprehensive tax reform. We cannot predict the impact, if any, of these changes on our business. However, it is possible that these changes could adversely affect our business. Until we know what changes are enacted, we will not know whether in total we benefit from, or are negatively affected by, the changes.\nOur operations are concentrated in two facilities, and the unavailability of one or both of these facilities could harm our business.\nOur manufacturing, research and development, sales and marketing, and administrative activities are concentrated in two facilities in the Chicago metropolitan area. Should a casualty, natural disaster, inclement weather, an act of terrorism, an outbreak of disease, power loss, an act of terrorism or similar event affect the Chicago area, our operations could be significantly impacted. We may not be able to replicate the manufacturing capacity and other operations of our Chicago facilities or such replication could take significant time and resources to accomplish. The disruption from such an event could adversely affect or interrupt entirely our ability to conduct our business.\nOur U.S. net operating loss carryforwards may expire or could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the Internal Revenue Code.\nWe have significant U.S. net operating loss carryforwards (the \u201cTax Attributes\u201d). Under federal tax laws, we can carry forward and use our Tax Attributes to reduce our future U.S. taxable income and tax liabilities until such Tax Attributes expire in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cIRC\u201d). Section 382 and Section 383 of the IRC provide an annual limitation on our ability to utilize our Tax Attributes, as well as certain built-in-losses, against future U.S. taxable income in the event of a change in ownership, as defined under the IRC. We may experience a change in ownership in the future as a result of changes in our stock ownership, and any such subsequent changes in ownership for purposes of the IRC could further limit our ability to use our Tax Attributes. Accordingly, any such occurrences could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nGlobal economic conditions could negatively impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe global financial crisis that began in late 2007 caused extreme disruption in the financial markets. Although the disruption in the financial markets moderated thereafter, the global financial markets continue to reflect uncertainty about a sustained economic recovery. Uncertainty about global economic conditions could result in slow economic activity, concerns about inflation and energy costs, decreased business and consumer confidence, reduced capital spending and adverse business conditions, as well as diminished liquidity and credit availability in many financial markets. In addition, these economic and business conditions could cause reduced spending in our target markets and make it difficult for our customers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. Continued weak economic conditions and further adverse trends in general economic conditions, consumer confidence, employment levels, business conditions, interest rates, availability of credit, inflation and taxation have in the past and may again in the future cause consumer spending to decline further, reduce demand for and prices of our products and our customers\u2019 products, affect the prices and availability of raw materials, and limit our ability to obtain financing for our operations. Furthermore, our customers may be unable to access capital efficiently, or at all, which could adversely affect our financial condition by resulting in product delays, increased defaults in accounts receivables and increased inventory exposures. Any unfavorable economic or market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK\nOur common stock could be delisted from NASDAQ if the closing bid price remains below $1.00 per share.\nOn April 19, 2016, when our common stock was listed on the NASDAQ Global Market, we received notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) indicating that we no longer complied with the minimum bid price requirement because the closing bid price for our stock had been below $1.00 for 30 consecutive business days. In accordance with the NASDAQ listing rules, we had an initial grace period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. On October 18, 2016, we received approval from NASDAQ to transfer the listing of our common stock from the NASDAQ Global Market to the NASDAQ Capital Market. This transfer was effective at the opening of business on October 20, 2016. As a result of this transfer, we were granted an additional 180-day grace period to regain compliance with NASDAQ\u2019s minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance and qualify for continued listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market, the bid price per share of our common stock must be at least $1.00 for at least ten consecutive business days during the additional 180-day grace period, which will end on April 17, 2017. NASDAQ may, in its discretion, require our common stock to maintain a bid price per share of at least $1.00 for a period in excess of ten consecutive business days, but generally no more than 20 consecutive business days, before determining that we have demonstrated an ability to maintain long-term compliance. If we fail to regain compliance by April 17, 2017, we expect that NASDAQ will provide written notification to us that our common stock will be delisted. At that time, we may appeal the delisting determination to a NASDAQ Hearings Panel and our common stock would remain listed pending the panel\u2019s decision. There can be no assurance that, if we appeal the delisting determination, such appeal would be successful. There is no assurance that our common stock will not be delisted. If our common stock is delisted, additional sales practice requirements would be imposed on broker-dealers who sell our securities. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these requirements could discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock. This would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would significantly negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. These factors could contribute to lower prices and larger spreads in the bid and ask prices for our common stock. In addition, if our common stock is delisted, it could make it significantly more difficult for us to raise capital and adversely affect the market liquidity for the offered securities. In connection with the transfer of our common stock to the NASDAQ Capital Market, we provided written notice to NASDAQ of our intention to cure the minimum bid price deficiency during the additional grace period, including by carrying out a reverse stock split, if necessary. If we seek to implement a reverse stock split in order to remain listed on\nNASDAQ, the announcement and/or implementation of a reverse stock split could significantly negatively affect the price of our common stock. Failure of our stockholders to approve a proposed reverse stock split, or any delay in receiving stockholder approval of a proposed reverse stock split, may hinder our ability to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile due to various factors, some of which are beyond our control, and each of which could adversely affect our stockholders\u2019 value.\nFrom our initial public offering through March 9, 2017, the trading price of our common stock has ranged from a low of $0.46 to a high of $35.90.\nFactors related to our Company and our business, as well as broad market and industry factors, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Such factors that could cause fluctuations in our stock price include, among other things:\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial guidance or estimates by us, by investors or by any financial analysts who might cover our stock or our industry;\n\u2022\nour ability to meet the performance expectations of financial analysts or investors;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n\u2022\ncredit conditions;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant products, contracts, acquisitions or strategic partnerships;\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nthe size of the public float of our stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders might consider in their best interests.\nA number of provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, may have the effect of delaying, deterring, preventing or rendering more difficult a change in control of Rubicon that our stockholders might consider in their best interests. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nestablishment of a classified Board of Directors;\n\u2022\ngranting to the Board of Directors sole power to set the number of directors and to fill any vacancy on the Board of Directors, whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the ability of stockholders to remove directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to designate and issue one or more series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, the terms of which may be determined at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors;\n\u2022\nprohibition on stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibition on stockholders from acting by written consent; and\n\u2022\nestablishment of advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for election to the Board of Directors at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nThe foregoing provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions may facilitate management entrenchment that may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a change in our control, which may not be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nWe are subject to litigation risks, including securities class action litigation, which may be costly to defend.\nAll industries, including ours, are subject to legal claims, including securities litigation. When the market price of a stock declines significantly, due to factors such as trends in the stock market in general, broad market and industry fluctuations or operating performance, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. This sort of litigation can be particularly costly and may divert the attention of our management and our resources in general. We have been subject to securities class action litigation in the past, as disclosed in our previous filings with the SEC. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process, the resolution of any particular legal claim or proceeding (including by settlement) could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Further, uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of securities or other litigation could harm our ability to obtain credit and financing for our operations and to compete in the marketplace.\nOur Board of Directors does not intend to declare or pay any dividends to our stockholders in the foreseeable future.\nThe declaration, payment and amount of any future dividends will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, the results of our operations, cash flows and financial condition, operating and capital requirements, and other factors the Board of Directors considers relevant. There is no plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, and if dividends are paid, there can be no assurance with respect to the amount of any such dividend.", "PERMNO": 92448, "SIC": 3674, "TIC": "RBCN"}
