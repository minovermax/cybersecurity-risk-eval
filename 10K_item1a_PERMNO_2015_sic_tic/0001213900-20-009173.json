{"cik": "1558583", "company": "Arcimoto Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-04-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Investors should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the financial statements and the related notes, before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks were to materialize, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our common stock could decline and investors could lose part or all of their investment in our common stock.\nThe notes to our financials for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 include an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe notes accompanying our December 31, 2019 and 2018 audited financial statements contain an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared \u201cassuming that we will continue as a going concern.\u201d Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on raising additional capital to fund our operations and ultimately on generating future profitable operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital or eventually have positive cash flow from operations to address all of our cash flow needs. If we are not able to find alternative sources of cash, or generate positive cash flow from operations, our operations, business and shareholders may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe recent COVID-19 pandemic has, and could continue to, materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d) has determined that the 2019 novel coronavirus is a \u201cglobal pandemic\u201d and President Trump has declared a national emergency as the impact of the virus on all aspects of daily life continues to multiply at an alarming rate. The name given to the disease, COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has quickly become a household word as schools, businesses, and entire nations implement aggressive preventative measures to combat the pandemic.\nWe, like many other manufacturers, have shuttered our plant to safeguard the health of our employees. As a result, we are not producing vehicles until the situation mitigates. Sustained continuation of the shut-down will harm our revenue and may cause the Company to run out of cash and cease operations altogether.\nWe may experience increases in the cost of or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of materials due to the pandemic and government efforts to stop it such as stay-at-home orders. Any such increase, supply interruption or shortage could materially and negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We use various materials in our business including aluminum, steel, lithium, nickel, copper and cobalt, as well as lithium-ion cells from suppliers. The prices for these materials fluctuate, and their available supply may be unstable, depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials. For instance, we are exposed to multiple risks relating to lithium-ion cells. These risks include:\n\u25cf an increase in the cost, or decrease in the available supply, of materials used in the cells; and\n\u25cf disruption in the supply of cells due to factory closures and workforce shortages due to effects of COVID-19.\nAs local and national governments impose travel limitations such as the nationwide travel restrictions imposed in the United States and Italy, we may encounter an increased inability to obtain parts for our vehicles. Vendors performing services for us may encounter issues that impact their operations, such as an increase in costs for materials or labor, or a decrease in available employees or contractors. We plan to proactively contact our vendors to inquire about any anticipated risks or difficulties in carrying out agreed-upon services, as well as the vendors\u2019 plans to mitigate such risks or difficulties, in order to anticipate potential delays and to prepare contingency plans. We are also aware of the risk that a vendor could invoke a force majeure clause to cease performance under applicable vendor agreements. All the foregoing issues raise substantial doubt about our ability to accurately forecast our costs, revenue and cash position. Our current planning is based on our best estimates but there is no assurance those estimates will turn out to be accurate. We will explore other methods of funding our business such as grants or strategic partnerships, but we cannot currently assess exactly how the pandemic will affect our costs, revenue and cash position at all levels.\nWe are an early stage company and have not yet generated significant revenues.\nWe have incurred a net loss in each year since our inception, have twelve years of operating history and have generated limited revenues since inception. Our limited operating history makes evaluating our business and future prospects difficult and may increase the risk of your investment. Arcimoto was founded in 2007, and we have only recently started retail vehicle production and sales. Production and purchasing volumes will need to increase, driving down unit cost, and we will incur additional engineering and tooling cost, in order to reduce vehicle cost before Arcimoto will achieve profitability.\nCustomer financing and insuring our vehicles may prove difficult because retail lenders are unfamiliar with our vehicles and the vehicles do not have a loss history in the insurance industry.\nRetail lenders are unfamiliar with our vehicles and may be hesitant to provide financing to our customers. Our vehicles do not have a loss history in the insurance industry which may cause our customers difficulty in securing insurance coverage.\nUnforeseen or recurring operational problems at our facility, or a catastrophic loss of our manufacturing facility, may cause significant lost or delayed production and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur manufacturing process could be affected by operational problems that could impair our production capability and the timeframes within which we expect to produce our vehicles. Our manufacturing facility contains high cost and sophisticated machines that are used in our manufacturing process. Disruptions or shut downs at our facility could be caused by:\n\u25cf maintenance outages to conduct maintenance activities that cannot be performed safely during operations;\n\u25cf prolonged power failures or reductions;\n\u25cf breakdown, failure or substandard performance of any of our machines or other equipment;\n\u25cf noncompliance with, and liabilities related to, environmental requirements or permits;\n\u25cf disruptions in the transportation infrastructure, including railroad tracks, bridges, tunnels or roads;\n\u25cf pandemics, fires, floods, snow or ice storms, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, microbursts or other catastrophic disasters, national emergencies, political unrest, war or terrorist activities; or\n\u25cf other operational problems.\nIf our manufacturing facility is compromised or shut down, it may experience prolonged startup periods, regardless of the reason for the compromise or shutdown. Those startup periods could range from several days to several weeks or longer, depending on the reason for the compromise or shutdown and other factors. Any disruption in operations at our facility could cause a significant loss of production, delays in our ability to produce our vehicles and adversely affect our results of operations and negatively impact our customers. Further, a catastrophic event could result in the loss of the use of all or a portion of our manufacturing facility. Although we carry property insurance, our coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur. Any of these events individually or in the aggregate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may not be able to obtain adequate financing to continue our operations.\nThe design, manufacture, sale and servicing of vehicles is a capital-intensive business. At December 31, 2019, our working capital was approximately $4,146,000, an increase of approximately $392,000 from December 31, 2018. We have previously raised funds through equity investment, convertible and non-convertible notes to meet our cash needs, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to raise enough additional capital in the short term to meet our ongoing cash requirements. Our need to raise additional funds to sustain operations and reach our vehicle production goals is dependent on how quickly we can secure financing and reduce the cost of our vehicles. We may raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related, or debt securities or through obtaining credit from government or financial institutions. We cannot assure anyone that we will be able to raise additional funds when needed. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, we will be unable to continue operations.\nWe may not have an adequate number of shares of common stock authorized to enable us to complete future equity financing transactions, which may adversely affect our ability to raise the capital necessary to continue operations.\nWe are authorized to issue 60,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 24,436,389 shares were outstanding on December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, we had reserved 2,596,031 shares of common stock for issuance upon exercise of our outstanding convertible notes, options and warrants. In addition, at such date, we had 1,939,048 shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under our 2018 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, 814,719 shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under our 2015 Stock Incentive Plan, and 658,317 shares of our common stock reserved for future issuance under our Amended and Restated 2012 Employee Stock Benefit Plan. If all of these securities were exercised, the total number of shares of our common stock that we would be required to issue would be 6,008,115, which in addition to the 24,436,389 shares outstanding, would leave 29,555,496 authorized but unissued shares of common stock.\nAs a result of our limited number of authorized and unissued shares of common stock, we may have insufficient shares of common stock available to issue in connection with any future equity financing transactions we may seek to undertake. Until we increase the number of authorized shares available for issuance, we may not be able to raise additional capital, which may adversely affect our ability to continue operations.\nIf we are unable to effectively implement or manage our developing growth strategy, our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nAs part of our developing growth strategy, we may modify our distribution channels and engage in strategic transactions with third parties to open rental locations, or open new retail, manufacturing, research or engineering facilities, expand our existing facility, add additional product lines or expand our businesses into new geographical markets. For example, we opened our first customer experience and rental location in Eugene, Oregon in October 2018. We used this location primarily as a test bed for developing rental operations. Rental operations are an untested business model for us. There is a range of risks inherent in such a strategy that could adversely affect our ability to successfully achieve these objectives, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf our inability to pay the leasing costs associated with our rental facilities in the near term;\n\u25cf the potential failure to successfully operate rental locations or integrate a rental vehicle business into our existing infrastructure;\n\u25cf an inability to attract and retain the customers, employees, suppliers and/or marketing partners of a rental business;\n\u25cf the uncertainty that we may not be able to generate, anticipate or meet consumer demand;\n\u25cf the potential disruption of our business;\n\u25cf the increased scope and complexity of our operations could require significant attention from management and impose constraints on our operations or other projects;\n\u25cf inconsistencies between our standards, procedures and policies and those of new rental facilities and costs or inefficiencies associated with the integration of our operational and administrative systems if necessary;\n\u25cf unforeseen expenses, delays or conditions, including the potential for increased regulatory compliance or other third-party approvals or consents, or provisions in contracts with third parties that could limit our flexibility to take certain actions;\n\u25cf the costs of compliance with local laws and regulations and the implementation of compliance processes, as well as the assumption of unexpected labilities, litigation, penalties or other enforcement actions;\n\u25cf the uncertainty that new product lines will generate anticipated sales;\n\u25cf the uncertainty that new rental or retail businesses will achieve anticipated operating results;\n\u25cf our cost reduction efforts might not be successful;\n\u25cf the difficulty of managing the operations of a larger company; and\n\u25cf the difficulty of competing for growth opportunities with companies having greater financial resources than we have.\nAny one of these factors could impair our growth strategy, result in delays, increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues derived from our growth strategy and could adversely impact our prospects, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe depend on our senior management team, and the loss of one or more key employees or an inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends largely upon the continued services of our key executive officers and other employees. We also rely on our leadership team in the areas of finance, research and development, marketing, services, and general and administrative functions, and on mission-critical individual contributors in sales and research and development. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives, which could disrupt our business.\nNone of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business. Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain executive officers and other key technology, sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing and support personnel and any failure to do so could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nTo continue to execute our growth strategy, we also must attract and retain highly skilled personnel. Competition is intense for salespeople and for engineers with high levels of experience in designing and developing electric vehicles. The pool of qualified personnel with engineering or manufacturing experience and/or experience working with the electric vehicle market is limited overall and specifically in Eugene, Oregon, where our principal office is located. In addition, many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have and are located in metropolitan areas that may attract more qualified workers.\nIn addition, in making employment decisions, particularly in high-technology industries, job candidates often consider the value of the equity awards they are to receive in connection with their employment. Volatility in the price of our stock might, therefore, adversely affect our ability to attract or retain highly skilled personnel. Furthermore, the requirement to expense certain stock awards might discourage us from granting the size or type of stock awards that job candidates require to join us. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be severely harmed.\nRecent political trends in the United States have created new uncertainty regarding the continuation of the ATVMLP.\nRecent announcements regarding budgeting and appropriations from the federal government have created uncertainty regarding whether the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program (the \u201cATVMLP\u201d) will continue to exist in its current form. The ATVMLP program provides for low-cost loans that can be used to reequip, expand, or establish manufacturing facilities for advanced technology vehicles in the United States. Although we are in the process of applying there is no guarantee that we would receive such a loan and are not dependent on receiving such a loan. If we do not receive financing under the ATVMLP, we may be required to seek financing from other sources at terms that are not as favorable to us.\nFuture disruptive new technologies could have a negative effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the risk of future disruptive technologies. If new vehicle technologies (electric or otherwise) develop that are superior to our vehicles, or are perceived to be superior by consumers, it could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in these industries. We currently face competition from new and established domestic and international competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future, including competition from companies with new technology.\nThe worldwide vehicle market, particularly for alternative fuel vehicles, is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future. There is no assurance that our vehicles will be successful in the respective markets in which they compete. Many established automobile manufacturers such as Audi, BMW, Daimler, General Motors, Tesla, Toyota and Volvo, as well as other newer companies such as Elio, Sondors and Electra Meccanica, have entered or are reported to have plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market, including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles. In some cases, such competitors have announced an intention to produce electric vehicles exclusively now or at some point in the future. Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, vehicle sales networks and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Increased competition could result in lower vehicle unit sales, price reductions, revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Additionally, industry overcapacity has resulted in many manufacturers offering marketing incentives on vehicles in an attempt to maintain and grow market share; these incentives historically have included a combination of subsidized financing or leasing programs, price rebates, and other incentives. As a result, we are not necessarily able to set our prices to offset higher costs. Continuation of or increased excess capacity could have a substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success is dependent upon consumers\u2019 willingness to adopt three-wheeled, tandem-seated two-passenger vehicles.\nIf we cannot develop sufficient market demand for three-wheeled vehicles, we will not be successful. Factors that may influence the acceptance of three-wheeled vehicles include:\n\u25cf perceptions about three-wheeled vehicles\u2019 comfort, quality, safety, design, performance and cost;\n\u25cf the availability of alternative fuel vehicles, including plug-in hybrid electric and all-electric vehicles;\n\u25cf improvements in the fuel economy and cost of service of the internal combustion engine;\n\u25cf uncertainties regarding insurance coverages for the vehicles;\n\u25cf the environmental consciousness of consumers;\n\u25cf volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline; and\n\u25cf government regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of transportation.\nWe may experience lower-than-anticipated market acceptance of our vehicles.\nAlthough we have conducted some market research regarding our electric vehicles and accumulated 4,197 pre-order reservation deposits as of December 31, 2019, many factors both within and outside our control, affect the success of new vehicles in the marketplace. At this time, it is difficult to measure consumers\u2019 willingness to adopt electric vehicles as a mode of transportation, particularly three-wheeled electric vehicles. Offering fuel-efficient vehicles that consumers want and value can mitigate the risks of increasing price competition and declining demand, but vehicles that are perceived to be less desirable (whether in terms of price, quality, styling, safety, overall value, or other attributes) can exacerbate these risks. For example, if a new vehicle were to experience quality issues at the time of launch, the vehicle\u2019s perceived quality could be affected even after the issues had been corrected, resulting in lower than anticipated sales volumes, market share, and profitability. Moreover, if a new vehicle is not accepted by consumers based on size, styling, or other attributes, we would experience lower than anticipated sales volumes, market share, and profitability.\nOur distribution model may result in lower sales volumes.\nOur present distribution model is different from the distribution models used by other vehicle manufacturers, except for Tesla Motors. Like Tesla, we plan to sell vehicles directly to our customers over the internet or via Arcimoto-owned retail stores, rather than through traditional dealer franchises. This direct sales model may result in lower sales due to customer reluctance to rely on web-based vehicle purchasing. We are unable to evaluate the effectiveness of our present distribution model and it may result in lower or higher sales volumes, market share, and profitability.\nAdditionally, we may not be able to sell our vehicles through this sales model in each state in the United States as some states have laws that may be interpreted to impose limitations on the direct-to-consumer sales of our vehicles. The application of these state laws to our operations is difficult to predict. Laws in some states will limit our ability to obtain dealer licenses from state motor vehicle regulators and may continue to do so in the future.\nIn addition, decisions by regulators permitting us to sell vehicles may be subject to challenges by dealer associations and others as to whether such decisions comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws. In similar circumstances, Tesla has prevailed in many of these lawsuits and such results reinforce our continuing belief that state laws were not designed to prevent our distribution model. In some states, there have also been regulatory and legislative efforts by vehicle dealer associations to propose bills and regulations that, if enacted, would prevent us from obtaining dealer licenses in their states given our current sales model. A few states have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate, but at the same time limits the number of dealer licenses we can obtain or stores that we can operate. Although Tesla and the state of Michigan have settled a lawsuit in federal court allowing Tesla to sell direct into the state, that is no guarantee of the success of similar suits.\nInternationally, there may be laws of which we are unaware of in jurisdictions we wish to enter that may restrict our sales or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time.\nThe discovery of defects in vehicles resulting in delays in new model launches, recall campaigns, reputational damage, or increased warranty costs may negatively affect our business.\nMeeting or exceeding many government-mandated safety standards is costly and often technologically challenging. Government safety standards also require manufacturers to remedy defects related to vehicle safety through safety recall campaigns, and a manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines that the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard. Should we or government safety regulators determine that a safety or other defect or noncompliance exists with respect to certain of our vehicles prior to the start of production, the launch of such vehicle could be delayed until such defect is remedied. The costs associated with any protracted delay in new product launches necessary to remedy such defects, or the cost of recall campaigns or warranty costs to remedy such defects in vehicles that have been sold, could be substantial. Further, adverse publicity surrounding actual or alleged safety-related or other defects could damage our reputation and adversely affect sales of our vehicles.\nWe are dependent on our suppliers, the majority of which are single source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels, and volumes acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nOur products contain numerous purchased parts which we source globally from multiple direct suppliers, the majority of whom are currently single source suppliers. Any significant unanticipated demand or delays with our suppliers could require us to procure additional components in a short amount of time, and in the past we have also replaced certain suppliers because of their failure to provide components that met our quality control standards. There is no assurance that we will be able to secure additional or alternative sources of supply or develop our own replacements for certain highly customized components of our products. If we encounter unexpected difficulties or delays with key suppliers, and if we are unable to fill these needs from other suppliers, we could experience production delays and potential loss of access to important technology and parts for producing, servicing and supporting our products.\nThere is no assurance that suppliers will ultimately be able to meet our cost, quality and volume needs. Furthermore, as the scale of our vehicle production increases, we will need to accurately forecast, purchase, warehouse and transport to our manufacturing facilities components at much higher volumes than we have experience with. If we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantities of component purchases to our actual production plans or capabilities, or successfully implement automation, inventory management and other systems to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain, we may have to incur unexpected storage, transportation and write-off costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may be unable to accurately forecast our vehicle delivery needs, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nArcimoto plans to deliver vehicles to Oregon and California via its internal transportation resources, primarily trucks and trailers. However, we anticipate that we will reach a point when utilizing a third party common carrier for vehicle deliveries will become a necessity. Because of the significant investment in equipment and management to implement a third party common carrier vehicle delivery plan, it will be important to accurately forecast vehicle delivery volumes in advance. It will be difficult to predict, especially months in advance, when our vehicle delivery volumes and geographic expansion will require using a third party common carrier for vehicle deliveries and if we miscalculate this timing, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain the strength and value of our brand could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends, in part, on the value and strength of our brand. Maintaining, enhancing, promoting and positioning our brand, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition, will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide high-quality services, warranty plans, products and resources and a consistent, high-quality customer experience. Our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives, if we fail to comply with laws and regulations, if we are subject to publicized litigation or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity. Some of these risks may be beyond our ability to control, such as the effects of negative publicity regarding our suppliers or third party providers of services or negative publicity related to members of management. Any of these events could hurt our image, resulting in reduced demand for our products and a decrease in net sales. Further, maintaining, enhancing, promoting and positioning our brands\u2019 images may require us to make substantial investments in marketing and employee training, which could adversely affect our cash flow and which may ultimately be unsuccessful. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe will be almost entirely dependent upon revenue generated from a limited number of products in the near-term, and our future success will be dependent upon our ability to design and achieve market acceptance of new product offerings and vehicle models.\nRevenue to date has come exclusively from the sale of Fun Utility Vehicles. The Rapid Responder and Deliverator pilot programs are underway, and we expect to deliver production models of those vehicles in Q3 2020 and Q4 2020, respectively.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain revenues from current product offerings, nor design future models of vehicles, or develop future services, that will meet the expectations of our customers, or that our future models will become commercially viable.\nIn addition, historically, automobile customers have come to expect new and improved vehicle models to be introduced frequently. In order to meet these expectations, we may in the future be required to introduce on a regular basis new vehicle models as well as enhanced versions of existing vehicle models. As technologies change in the future for automobiles, we will be expected to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles with the latest technology. We have limited experience simultaneously designing, testing, manufacturing and selling vehicles. To date, we have focused our business on the development of a low-cost and high efficiency vehicle and have targeted a relatively narrow consumer group. We will need to address additional markets and expand our customer demographic to further grow our business. Our failure to address additional market opportunities could materially harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWe have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future, significant delays or other complications in the design, manufacture, launch and production ramp of our vehicle, which could harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nHaving experienced past delays or complications suggests that we may experience future launch, manufacturing and production ramp delays or other complications in connection with our vehicles. For example, we may underestimate the amount of time necessary for regulatory testing and design changes or design changes necessary for automated production like robotic welding which would delay the production of our vehicles. While we continue to make progress resolving such early issues, it is difficult to predict exactly how long it will take for all issues to be cleared or when further issues may arise. Any significant additional delay or other complication in the production of our vehicles or the development, manufacture, launch and production ramp of our future products, including complications associated with expanding our production capacity, supply chain or regulatory approvals, could materially damage our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\nDevelopments and improvements in alternative technologies such as hybrid engine or full electric vehicles or in the internal combustion engine or continued low retail gasoline prices may materially and adversely affect the demand for our three-wheeled vehicles.\nSignificant developments in alternative technologies, such as advanced diesel, ethanol, fuel cells or compressed natural gas, or improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine, may materially and adversely affect our business and prospects in ways that we do not currently anticipate. If alternative energy engines or low gasoline prices make existing four-wheeled vehicles with greater passenger and cargo capacities less expensive to operate, we may not be able to compete with manufacturers of such vehicles.\nLegal, Regulatory and Litigation Risks\nIncreased safety, emissions, fuel economy, or other regulations may result in higher costs, cash expenditures, and/or sales restrictions.\nThe motorized vehicle industry is governed by a substantial amount of government regulation, which often differs by state and region. Government regulation has arisen, and proposals for additional regulation are advanced, primarily out of concern for the environment, vehicle safety, and energy independence. In addition, many governments regulate local product content and/or impose import requirements as a means of creating jobs, protecting domestic producers, and influencing the balance of payments. The cost to comply with existing government regulations is substantial, and future, additional regulations could have a substantial adverse impact on our financial condition.\nUnusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in our vehicles, or otherwise may derail our business.\nAlthough we plan to comply with governmental safety regulations, mobile and stationary source emissions regulations, and other standards, compliance with governmental standards, does not necessarily prevent individual or class action lawsuits, which can entail significant cost and risk. In certain circumstances, courts may permit tort claims even when our vehicles comply with federal law and/or other applicable law. Furthermore, simply responding to actual or threatened litigation or government investigations of our compliance with regulatory standards, whether related to our vehicles or business or commercial relationships, may require significant expenditures of time and other resources. Litigation also is inherently uncertain, and we could experience significant adverse results if litigation is ever brought against us. In addition, adverse publicity surrounding an allegation of a defect, regulatory violation or other matter (with or without corresponding litigation or governmental investigation) may cause significant reputational harm that could have a significant adverse effect on our sales.\nWe may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims.\nWe may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. The motor vehicle industry experiences significant product liability claims and we face an inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform as expected or malfunction resulting in personal injury or death. A successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. Moreover, a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our vehicles and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future vehicle candidates, which could have material adverse effect on our brand, business, prospects and operating results. Any lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages either in excess of our liability coverage, or outside of our coverage, may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial condition. We may not be able to secure product liability insurance coverage on commercially acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed, particularly if we do face liability for our products and are forced to make a claim under our policy.\nLimited intellectual property protection may cause us to lose our competitive advantage and adversely affect our business.\nWe have been granted nine utility patents, and have an additional patent application undergoing examination that relates to the overall vehicle platform. This patent application and/or any patent applications we may file in the future may not be successful. To date, we have relied on copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements, to establish and protect intellectual property rights to our technologies and vehicles. We typically enter into confidentiality or license agreements with employees, consultants, consumers and vendors in an effort to control access to and distribution of technology, software, documentation and other information. Policing unauthorized use of this technology is difficult and the steps taken may not prevent misappropriation of the technology. In addition, effective protection may be unavailable or limited in some jurisdictions outside the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or protect our rights or to determine the validity and scope of the rights of others. Such litigation could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert resources away from daily business, which in turn could materially adversely affect the business.\nOur failure to obtain or maintain the right to use certain intellectual property may negatively affect our business.\nOur future success and competitive position depend in part upon our ability to obtain or maintain certain proprietary intellectual property used in our principal products. This may be achieved, in part, by prosecuting claims against others who we believe are infringing our rights and by defending claims of intellectual property infringement brought by others. In the future we may commence lawsuits against others if we believe they have infringed our rights, or we may become subject to lawsuits alleging that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others. For example, to the extent that we have previously incorporated third-party technology and/or know-how into certain products for which we do not have sufficient license rights, we could incur substantial litigation costs, be forced to pay substantial damages or royalties, or even be forced to cease sales in the event any owner of such technology or know-how were to challenge our subsequent sale of such products (and any progeny thereof). In addition, to the extent that we discover or have discovered third-party patents that may be applicable to products or processes in development, we may need to take steps to avoid claims of possible infringement, including obtaining non-infringement or invalidity opinions and, when necessary, re-designing or re-engineering products. However, we cannot assure you that these precautions will allow us to successfully avoid infringement claims. Our involvement in intellectual property litigation could result in significant expense to us, adversely affect the development of sales of the challenged product or intellectual property and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor. In the event of an adverse outcome in any such litigation, we may, among other things, be required to:\n\u25cf pay substantial damages;\n\u25cf cease the development, manufacture, use, sale or importation of products that infringe upon other patented intellectual property;\n\u25cf expend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing intellectual property;\n\u25cf discontinue processes incorporating infringing technology; or\n\u25cf obtain licenses to the infringing intellectual property.\nWe may be affected by uncertainty over government purchase incentives.\nOur vehicle cost thesis strongly benefits from purchase incentives at the state and national government levels. The existence or lack of tax incentives will affect the adoption velocity of our products in the marketplace. An inability to take advantage of tax incentives may negatively affect our revenues.\nMotor vehicles, like those produced by Arcimoto, are highly regulated and are subject to regulatory changes.\nWe are aware that the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration is reviewing whether to adopt new safety regulations pertaining to three-wheeled motor vehicles. Currently, United States motorcycle regulations apply to such vehicles. New regulations could impact the design of our vehicles and our ability to produce vehicles, possibly negatively affecting our financial results. Additionally, state level regulations are inconsistent with regard to whether a helmet is required to operate an Arcimoto vehicle. Sales may be negatively impacted should any state alter its requirements with regard to customer use of helmets.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price at which you purchase it.\nThe stock market generally, and our stock in particular, has experienced price and volume fluctuations. As a result of this volatility, you might not be able to sell your common stock at or above the price at which you purchase it. The public market for our stock is new. From our Regulation A Offering on September 21, 2017 through December 31, 2019, the per share trading price of our common stock has been as high as $7.35 and as low as $1.53. It might continue to fluctuate significantly in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u25cf changes to the electric car industry, including demand and regulations;\n\u25cf our ability to compete successfully against current and future competitors;\n\u25cf competitive pricing pressures;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain working capital financing;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf sales of our common stock;\n\u25cf our ability to execute our growth strategy;\n\u25cf operating results that fall below expectations;\n\u25cf loss of any strategic relationship;\n\u25cf regulatory developments; and\n\u25cf economic and other external factors.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These fluctuations might be even more pronounced in the new trading market for our stock. Additionally, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. On March 11, 2018, we were served with a Summons Notice of case number: CGC-18-564904 John R Switzer vs W.R. Hambrecht & Co. LLC et al., including Arcimoto, Inc., its officers and directors. On March 28, 2018, we were served with another lawsuit entitled Jay Mendelson v. Arcimoto, Inc. et al., case number CGC-18-565324. The cases were combined and the motion for final approval of the settlement agreement was granted on March 13, 2020. By its terms, the settlement agreement resolves this litigation in its entirety. Please see \u201cPart I. Item 3, Legal Proceedings\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information, and \u201cLitigation\u201d under Note 11 to the Financial Statements beginning at page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference herein.\nWe may not be able to satisfy listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market to maintain a listing of our common stock.\nOur common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market and we must meet certain financial, liquidity and governance criteria to maintain such listing. If we fail to meet any of NASDAQ Capital Market\u2019s listing standards, our common stock may be delisted. In addition, our board of directors may determine that the cost of maintaining our listing on a national securities exchange outweighs the benefits of such listing. A delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ Capital Market may materially impair our stockholders\u2019 ability to buy and sell our common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of, and the efficiency of the trading market for, our common stock. In addition, the delisting of our common stock could significantly impair our ability to raise capital.\nAs a smaller reporting company and as an emerging growth company, we are exempt from certain disclosure requirements, which could make our common stock less attractive to potential investors.\nWe currently and for the foreseeable future expect to be categized as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the U.S. federal securities laws.\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are exempt from certain disclosure requirements under those laws. For example, we are not required and may not include a Compensation Discussion and Analysis section in our proxy statements; we provide only two years of financial statements; we do not need to provide the table of selected financial data; and are not required to comply with Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires our registered public accounting firm to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As an emerging growth company, there are exemptions from reporting requirements similar to those applicable to a smaller reporting company. These and certain other \u201cscaled\u201d disclosure provisions under SEC rules for smaller reporting companies and emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to potential investors, which could make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell their shares.\nBecause of our status as a smaller reporting company and an emerging growth company, you will not be able to depend on any attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm as to our internal control over financial reporting for the foreseeable future.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until the later of the year following our first annual report required to be filed with the Commission, the date we are no longer an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act or the date we no longer qualify as a smaller reporting company. Accordingly, you will not be able to depend on any attestation concerning our internal control over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm for the foreseeable future.\nWe have not yet finalized our internal controls policies and procedures over financial reporting.\nWe believe our internal controls over financial reporting are robust for our current stage of development. As we ramp up production, we will be developing and implementing new and more robust internal controls over financial reporting which is time consuming, costly, and complicated. These new control policies will include the appropriate amount of overhead to allocate to cost of goods sold. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if our management is unable to assert, when required, that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to attest, when required, to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nWe incur increased costs as a result of operating as a listed public company and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives and corporate governance practices.\nAs a listed public company, and particularly if at some point in the future we are no longer an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company, we incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we have not incurred in the past. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Capital Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to compliance with these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costlier. For example, we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, which could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we will incur as a listed public company or the timing of such costs.\nOur shares are thinly traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market and an active market may never develop.\nThere is a very limited trading market for our common stock and we cannot ensure that an active market will ever develop or be sustained. In addition, the price of our common stock may not reflect our actual or perceived value. There can be no assurance that there will be an active market for our shares of common stock in the future. The market liquidity will be dependent on the perception of our operating business, among other things. We may, in the future, take certain steps, including utilizing investor awareness campaigns, press releases, and conferences to increase awareness of our business and any steps that we might take to bring us to the awareness of investors may require we compensate consultants with cash and/or stock. There can be no assurance that there will be any awareness generated or the results of any efforts will result in any impact on our trading volume. Consequently, investors may not be able to liquidate their investment or liquidate it at a price that reflects the value of the business and trading may be at an inflated price relative to the performance of our company due to, among other things, availability of sellers of our shares. Because there may be a low price for our shares of common stock, many brokerage firms or clearing firms may not be willing to effect transactions in the securities or accept our shares for deposit in an account. Even if an investor finds a broker willing to effect a transaction in the shares of our common stock, the combination of brokerage commissions, transfer fees, taxes, if any, and any other selling costs may exceed the selling price.\nIf our shares become subject to the penny stock rules, it would become more difficult to trade our shares.\nThe SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. If we do not retain our listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market and if the price of our common stock is less than $5.00, our common stock will be deemed a penny stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock rules require that before effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive (i) the purchaser\u2019s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares.\nFINRA sales practice requirements may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our stock.\nIn addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules described above, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative, low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. The FINRA requirements may make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in our common stock. As a result, fewer broker-dealers may be willing to make a market in our common stock, reducing a stockholder\u2019s ability to resell shares of our common stock.\nThe preparation of our financial statements involves the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions, and our financial statements may be materially affected if such estimates, judgments or assumptions prove to be inaccurate.\nFinancial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or \u201cGAAP\u201d, typically require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Often, different estimates, judgments and assumptions could reasonably be used that would have a material effect on such financial statements, and changes in these estimates, judgments and assumptions may occur from period to period over time. Significant areas of accounting requiring the application of management\u2019s judgment include, but are not limited to, valuation of equity compensation, lower of cost or net realizable value estimates, overhead allocation, warranty reserves, determining the fair value of assets and the timing and amount of cash flows from assets. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are inherently uncertain and, if our estimates were to prove to be wrong, we would face the risk that charges to income or other financial statement changes or adjustments would be required. Any such charges or changes could harm our business, including our financial condition and results of operations and the price of our securities. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for a discussion of the accounting estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements and our business.\nWe have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends in the future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our common stock will depend on earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\nYou will experience future dilution as a result of future equity offerings.\nWe may in the future offer additional shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock. Although no assurances can be given that we will consummate a financing, in the event we do, or in the event we sell shares of common stock or other securities convertible into shares of our common stock in the future, additional and substantial dilution will occur. In addition, investors purchasing shares or other securities in the future could have rights superior to investors in prior offerings. Subsequent offerings at a lower price, often referred to as a \u201cdown round\u201d, could result in additional dilution.\nFuture issuances of debt securities, which would rank senior to our common stock upon our bankruptcy or liquidation, and future issuances of preferred stock, which would rank senior to our common stock for the purposes of dividends and liquidating distributions, may adversely affect the level of return you may be able to achieve from an investment in our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by offering debt securities. Upon bankruptcy or liquidation, holders of our debt securities, and lenders with respect to other borrowings we may make, would receive distributions of our available assets prior to any distributions being made to holders of our common stock. Moreover, if we issue preferred stock, the holders of such preferred stock could be entitled to preferences over holders of common stock in respect of the payment of dividends and the payment of liquidating distributions. Because our decision to issue debt or preferred securities in any future offering, or borrow money from lenders, will depend in part on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any such future offerings or borrowings. Holders of our common stock must bear the risk that any future offerings we conduct or borrowings we make may adversely affect the level of return they may be able to achieve from an investment in our common stock.\nSales by our significant stockholders could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock.\nAt least one of our stockholders, Mr. Frohnmayer, owns a significant amount of our common stock. If he were to sell all or a portion of his holdings of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could be negatively impacted. The effect of such sales, or of significant portions of our stock being offered or made available for sale, could result in strong downward pressure on our stock price. Investors should be aware that they could experience significant short-term volatility in our stock if such stockholders decide to sell all or a portion of their holdings of our common stock at once or within a short period of time.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Oregon law might discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Oregon law might discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, acquisition, or other change in control that stockholders consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock. These provisions might also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include:\n\u25cf limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings;\n\u25cf the inability of stockholders to cumulate votes at any election of directors; and\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to make, alter or repeal our bylaws.\nOur board of directors has the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval. In addition, Section 60.835 and Section 60.840 of the Oregon Revised Statutes prohibits a publicly held Oregon corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% or more of our voting stock, at any time within the preceding three-year period, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of Arcimoto, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.\nIf securities industry analysts do not publish additional research reports on us, or publish unfavorable reports on us, then the market price and market trading volume of our common stock could be negatively affected.\nAny trading market for our common stock will be influenced in part by any research reports that securities industry analysts publish about us. To date, we have been covered by five research analysts. We may not obtain any future research coverage by additional securities industry analysts. In the event we are covered by additional analysts, and one or more of such analysts downgrade our securities, or otherwise reports on us unfavorably, or discontinues coverage on us, the market price and market trading volume of our common stock could be negatively affected.\nA cybersecurity breach may adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, revenue and earnings.\nThe Company and certain of its third-party service providers and vendors receive, store, and transmit digital personal information in connection with the Company\u2019s human resources operations, financial services operations, e-commerce, rental franchise management, mobile applications, planned connected vehicle services offerings and other aspects of its business. The Company\u2019s information systems, and those of its third-party service providers and vendors, are vulnerable to the continually evolving cybersecurity risks. The Company\u2019s plan to offer connected vehicle services will heighten these risks. Unauthorized parties have attempted to and may attempt in the future to gain access to these systems or the information the Company and its third-party service providers and vendors maintain and use through fraud or other means of deceiving our employees and third-party service providers and vendors. Hardware, software or applications the Company develops or obtains from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security and/or the Company\u2019s operations. The methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and may be difficult to anticipate or detect. The Company has implemented and regularly reviews and updates processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss. However, the ever-evolving threats mean the Company and third-party service providers and vendors must continually evaluate and adapt systems and processes, and there is no guarantee that they will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data. The Company has experienced information security attacks, but to date they have not materially compromised the Company\u2019s computing environment or resulted in a material impact on the Company\u2019s business or operations or the release of confidential information about employees, customers, franchisees, suppliers or other third parties. Any future significant compromise or breach of the Company\u2019s data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of customer, employee, franchisee, supplier or Company data could result in disruption to the Company\u2019s operations, significant costs, lost sales, fines and lawsuits, and/or damage to the Company\u2019s reputation. In addition, as the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, with new and evolving requirements, compliance could also result in the Company being required to incur additional costs. The Company has mediated its financial exposure by securing cyber liability insurance.", "PERMNO": 16927, "SIC": 3711, "TIC": "FUV"}
