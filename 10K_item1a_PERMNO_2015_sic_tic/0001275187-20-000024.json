{"cik": "1275187", "company": "ANGIODYNAMICS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-08-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the Company's business. Our financial and operating results are subject to a number of factors, many of which are not within our control. These factors include those set forth below. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nMany healthcare industry companies, including medical device companies, are consolidating to create new companies with greater market power. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense. These industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price concessions or reductions for medical devices that incorporate components produced by us. If we are forced to reduce our prices because of consolidation in the healthcare industry, our revenues would decrease and our consolidated earnings, financial condition, or cash flow would suffer.\nWe face intense competition in the medical device industry. We may be unable to compete effectively with respect to technological innovation and price which may have an adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe markets for our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to continue to intensify. We may not be able to compete effectively, and we may lose market share to our competitors. Our primary device competitors include: Boston Scientific Corporation; Cook Medical; Medical Components, Inc. (MedComp); TeleFlex Medical; BD Medical Technology; Smiths Medical, a subsidiary of Smiths Group plc; Medtronic; Merit Medical; Terumo Medical Corporation; Johnson and Johnson; Varian Medical Systems and Total Vein Systems. Many of our competitors have substantially greater:\n\u2022financial and other resources to devote to product acquisitions, research and development, marketing and manufacturing;\n\u2022variety of products;\n\u2022technical capabilities;\n\u2022history of developing and introducing new products;\n\u2022patent portfolios that may present an obstacle to our conduct of business;\n\u2022name recognition; and\n\u2022distribution networks and in-house sales forces.\nOur competitors may succeed in developing technologies and products earlier, in obtaining patent protection or regulatory clearance earlier, or in commercializing new products or technologies more rapidly than us. Our competitors may also develop products and technologies that are superior to those we are developing or that otherwise could render our products obsolete or noncompetitive. In addition, we may face competition from providers of other medical therapies, such as pharmaceutical companies, that may offer non-surgical therapies for conditions that are currently, or in the future, may be treated using our products. Our products are generally sold at higher prices than those of our competitors. However, in the current environment of managed care, which is characterized by economically motivated buyers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates, we are increasingly being required to compete on the basis of price. If we are not able to compete effectively, our market share and revenues may decline.\nWe face intense competition from other companies, and our inability to continue to effectively develop, acquire and/or market new products and technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.\nThe medical device business is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions and evolving customer requirements. Our customers consider many factors when choosing among products, including features and reliability, quality, technology, clinical or economic outcomes, availability, price and services provided by the manufacturer. We face competition globally from a wide range of companies, some of which may have greater resources than us, which may enable them to adapt faster than us to customer needs or changes in customer requirements. Product introductions, alternative products or enhancements by competitors that provide better features, clinical outcomes or economic value and/or offer lower pricing may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive. In addition, the trend of consolidation in the medical device industry and among our customers could result in greater competition and pricing pressures.\nAs a result, we engage in product development and improvement programs to maintain and improve our competitive position. These development and improvement programs involve significant investment in research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals and may require more time than anticipated to bring such products to market. We may not, however, be successful in enhancing existing products or developing new products or technologies that will achieve regulatory approval, be developed or manufactured in a cost effective manner, obtain appropriate intellectual property protection or receive market acceptance and we may be unable to recover all or a meaningful part of our investment in such products or technologies. Additionally, there can be no assurance that the size of the markets in which we compete will increase above existing levels or not decline, that we will be able to maintain, gain or regain market share or that we can compete effectively on the basis of price or that the number of procedures in which our products are used will increase above existing levels or not decline.\nAs part of our business strategy, we also pursue the acquisition of complementary businesses, technologies and products. We may not be able to identify appropriate acquisition candidates, consummate transactions or obtain agreements with favorable terms. Further, once a business is acquired, any inability to successfully integrate the business, decreases in customer loyalty or product orders, failure to retain and develop its workforce, failure to establish and maintain appropriate controls or unknown or contingent liabilities could adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition. The integration of an acquired business, whether or not successful, requires significant efforts which may result in additional expenses and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel from other projects. These transactions are inherently risky, and there can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful. If we fail to develop and successfully manufacture and launch new products, generate satisfactory clinical results, provide sufficient economic value, enhance existing products, or identify, acquire and integrate complementary businesses, technologies and products or if we experience a decrease in market size or market share or declines in average selling price or procedural volumes, or otherwise fail to compete effectively, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIf we are not able to successfully execute our business development strategies our business and prospects could be materially impacted.\nWe expect to continue to engage in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These activities may result in substantial investment of our time and financial resources. Our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition or investment; competition from competitors seeking similar opportunities; whether we are able to negotiate terms that are satisfactory to us or at all; and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company, business, product, technology or research into our existing operations, including the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process R&D projects and to maintain adequate controls over the combined operations. If we are unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may not be able to achieve our growth goals or we may incur significantly more expenses than we anticipate.\nIf we do not maintain our reputation with interventional physicians, interventional and surgical oncologists and critical care nurses our growth will be limited and our business could be harmed.\nPhysicians typically influence the medical device purchasing decisions of the hospitals and other healthcare institutions in which they practice. Consequently, our reputation with interventional physicians, interventional and surgical oncologists and critical care nurses is crucial to our continued growth. We believe that we have built a positive reputation based on the quality of our products, our physician-driven product development efforts, our marketing and training efforts and our presence at medical society meetings. Any actual or perceived diminution in the quality of our products, or our failure or inability to maintain these other efforts, could damage our reputation with interventional physicians and cause our growth to be limited and our business to be harmed.\nIf we fail to develop or market new products and enhance existing products, we could lose market share to our competitors and our results of operations could suffer.\nThe market for interventional devices is characterized by rapid technological change, new product introductions, technological improvements, changes in physician requirements and evolving industry standards. To be successful, we must continue to develop and commercialize new products and to enhance versions of our existing products. Our products are technologically complex and require significant research, planning, design, development and testing before they may be marketed. This process generally takes at least 12 to 18 months from initial concept and may take up to several years. In addition, product life cycles are relatively short because medical device manufacturers continually develop smaller, more effective and less expensive versions of existing devices in response to physician demand.\nOur success in developing and commercializing new and enhanced versions of our products is affected by our ability to:\n\u2022recruit engineers;\n\u2022timely and accurately identify new market trends;\n\u2022accurately assess customer needs;\n\u2022minimize the time and costs required to obtain regulatory clearance or approval;\n\u2022adopt competitive pricing;\n\u2022timely manufacture and deliver products;\n\u2022accurately predict and control costs associated with the development, manufacturing and support of our products; and\n\u2022anticipate and compete effectively with our competitors\u2019 efforts.\nMarket acceptance of our products depends in part on our ability to demonstrate that our products are cost-effective and easier to use, as well as offer technological advantages. Additionally, we may experience design, manufacturing, marketing or other difficulties that could delay or prevent our development, introduction or marketing of new products or new versions of our existing products. As a result of such difficulties and delays, our development expenses may increase and, as a consequence, our results of operations could suffer.\nDevelopment and sales of our products are dependent on a number of factors beyond our control, and our inability to make and complete research and development investments, enhance the product development process and be innovative to solve customer needs with respect to the respective products may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant aspect of our growth strategy is the continued market development of products including NanoKnife, AngioVac, Auryon and BioFlo products.\nThere can be no guarantee that we will be able to develop and manufacture additional next generation or updated products on commercially favorable terms, or at all. NanoKnife, AngioVac and Auryon are developing technologies and the inability of any of them to achieve clinical acceptance, as well as our inability to generate meaningful clinical data to convince providers of the clinical and economic benefits of our BioFlo platform, could severely limit our ability to drive revenue growth.\nThe future prospects of many of our high growth products, such as NanoKnife, AngioVac and Auryon, rely on continued generation of clinical data pursuant to clinical trials conducted by us, our competitors or other third parties. If the results of these trials are not what we expect, or are perceived as unfavorable by the market, our business could be materially harmed.\nAs a part of the market development and regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints. Negative, unexpected or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, by our competitors or by third parties, or the market's or regulators\u2019 negative perception of this clinical data, may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals and successfully market our products and our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects may be materially impacted.\nOur business and prospects depend heavily on NanoKnife, which is currently approved for the surgical ablation of soft tissue. If we are unable to secure expanded specific regulatory approvals for NanoKnife, our business and prospects may be materially harmed.\nOur NanoKnife System is indicated for the surgical ablation of soft tissue. The long-term prospects for our NanoKnife business may rely on securing expanded indications for specific disease states and treatments. Based on our current indication, our ability to promote NanoKnife and provide training with respect to the use of NanoKnife is limited to the surgical ablation of soft tissue. In the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended May 31, 2019, we received approval from the FDA to initiate our DIRECT clinical trial to study the use of NanoKnife for the treatment of Stage III pancreatic cancer. If we are not able to successfully complete this trial and secure clearances or approvals for expanded indications for our NanoKnife System, including for the treatment of Stage III pancreatic cancer, or if expanded indications are significantly delayed or limited, our business and prospects may be materially harmed and we may need to delay our initiatives or even significantly curtail operations.\nOur business and prospects rely heavily upon our ability to successfully complete clinical trials, including our NanoKnife DIRECT Clinical study, our Auryon Pathfinder study and clinical studies for AngioVac. We may choose to, or may be required to, suspend, repeat or terminate our clinical trials if they are not conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, the results are negative or inconclusive or the trials are not well designed.\nClinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which the clinical trials are conducted, including FDA\u2019s current Good Clinical Practices. The clinical trials are subject to oversight by the\nFDA, regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions, ethics committees and institutional review boards at the medical institutions where the clinical trials are conducted. Clinical trial protocols may require a large number of patients to be enrolled in the trials. Patient enrollment is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population for the target indication, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, the existence of competing clinical trials and the availability of alternative or new treatments. Clinical trials may be suspended by the FDA or by a regulatory agency in another jurisdiction at any time if the FDA or the regulatory agency finds deficiencies in the conduct of these trials or it is believed that these trials expose patients to unacceptable health risks.\nWe, the FDA or regulatory agencies in other jurisdictions might delay or terminate our clinical trials for various reasons, including:\n\u2022Enrolled patients may have unforeseen adverse side effects;\n\u2022New therapies may become the standard of care while we are conducting our clinical trials, which may require us to revise or amend our clinical trial protocols or terminate a clinical trial;\n\u2022Fatalities may occur during a clinical trial due to medical problems that may or may not be related to clinical trial treatments;\n\u2022Patient enrollment in the clinical trials may be insufficient or significantly delayed.\nPatients may be discouraged from enrolling in our clinical trials if the trial protocol requires them to undergo extensive follow-up to assess the safety and effectiveness of NanoKnife treatments, or if they determine that the treatments received under the trial protocols are not attractive or involve unacceptable risks or discomforts. Patients may also not participate in our clinical trials if they choose to participate in contemporaneous clinical trials of competing products. In addition, the inclusion of critically ill patients in our clinical trials may result in deaths or other adverse medical events for reasons that may not be related to the clinical trial.\nIn addition, we rely on contract research organizations, or CROs, with respect to conducting our clinical trials. We may experience significant cost overruns associated with, and we may encounter difficulties managing, these CROs.\nTermination of our clinical trials or significant delays in completing our clinical trials could have a materially negative impact on our financial condition and prospects.\nWe, our competitors or other third parties, may engage in clinical trials with respect to our products. The results of these trials may be unfavorable, or perceived as unfavorable by the market, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur products may be the subject of clinical trials conducted by us, our competitors or third parties for the purposes of obtaining regulatory clearances or to gather market data. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, by our competitors or by third parties, or the FDA's or the market's perception of this clinical data, may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate and our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects.\nUndetected defects may increase our costs and impair the market acceptance of our products.\nOur products have occasionally contained, and may in the future contain, undetected defects. When these problems occur, we must divert the attention of our engineering personnel to address them. There is no assurance that we will not incur warranty or repair costs, be subject to liability claims for damages related to product defects, or experience manufacturing, shipping or other delays or interruptions as a result of these defects in the future. Our insurance policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted. In addition, the occurrence of defects may result in significant customer relations problems and injury to our reputation, and may impair market acceptance of our products.\nIf we are unable to convince customers that our products can improve the cost structure of their business, our revenue growth and profitability may be materially adversely impacted.\nWorldwide initiatives to contain healthcare costs have led government and the private sector to enact cost containment efforts as a means of managing the growth of health care utilization. Common techniques include policies on price regulation, competitive pricing, bidding and tender mechanics, coverage and payment, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments, and managed-care arrangements. These changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical devices and therapies. Government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health care insurance, and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedures or treatments, tying reimbursement to outcomes, shifting to population health management, and other mechanisms designed to constrain utilization and contain costs. Simultaneously, hospitals are\nredefining their role in health care delivery as many assume much more risk and control of the total cost of patient care. To successfully make this transformation, health systems are consolidating, purchasing or partnering with physicians, post-acute care providers, while also narrowing networks thus allowing greater control over outcomes. Today, many systems are becoming \u2018mini\u2019 payer/provider organizations. These newly redesigned health systems are creating mechanisms such as value analysis and centralized purchasing functions that set pricing and in some cases limit the number of vendors that can participate in the purchasing program. Hospitals are also aligning interests with physicians through employment and other arrangements, such as gainsharing, where a hospital agrees with physicians to share any realized cost savings resulting from the physicians\u2019 collective change in practice patterns such as standardization of devices where medically appropriate. This has created an increasing level of price sensitivity among customers for our products. Some third-party payers must also approve coverage and set reimbursement levels for new or innovative devices or therapies before they will reimburse health care providers who use the medical devices or therapies. Even though a new medical device may have been cleared for commercial distribution, we may find limited demand for the device until coverage and sufficient reimbursement levels have been obtained from governmental and private third-party payers. In addition, some private third-party payers require that certain procedures or that the use of certain products be authorized in advance as a condition of reimbursement. International examples of cost containment initiatives and health care reforms advancing clinical outcomes as the key to market access are emerging in France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. This new criteria can severely restrict coverage, reduce reimbursement and delay access to key markets with requirements for incremental clinical benefit and coverage with evidence development.\nCost-containment efforts of group purchasing organizations could adversely affect our selling prices, financial position and results of operations.\nMany of our existing and potential customers have become members of group purchasing organizations, or GPOs, and integrated delivery network, or IDNs, in an effort to reduce costs. GPOs and IDNs negotiate pricing arrangements with healthcare product manufacturers and distributors and offer the negotiated prices to affiliated hospitals and other members. GPOs and IDNs typically award contracts on a category-by-category basis through a competitive bidding process. Bids are generally solicited from multiple manufacturers with the intention of driving down pricing. Due to the highly competitive nature of the GPO and IDN contracting processes, we may not be able to obtain market prices for our products or obtain or maintain contract positions with major GPOs and IDNs, which could adversely impact our profitability. Also, sales through a GPO or IDN can be significant to our business and if we are unable to retain contracts with our customers, or acquire additional contracts, our financial results may be negatively impacted.\nWe are dependent on single and limited source suppliers which subjects our business and results of operations to risks of supplier business interruptions.\nWe currently purchase significant amounts of several key products and product components from single and limited source suppliers and anticipate that we will do so for future products as well. Any delays in delivery of or shortages in those or other products and components could interrupt and delay manufacturing of our products and result in the cancellation of orders for our products. Any or all of these suppliers could discontinue the manufacture or supply of these products and components at any time. Due to FDA and other business considerations, we may not be able to identify and integrate alternative sources of supply in a timely fashion or at all. Any transition to alternate suppliers may result in production delays and increased costs and may limit our ability to deliver products to our customers. Furthermore, if we are unable to identify alternative sources of supply, we would have to modify our products to use substitute components, which may cause delays in shipments, increased design and manufacturing costs and increased prices for our products.\nIn addition, we purchase certain products as a distributor for the manufacturer of those products. Operational, quality or regulatory issues of the manufacturers of the products we distribute could constrain or interrupt the availability of those products or services. Any constraint or interruption in the supply of finished products that we distribute could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell products, our financial condition and our results of operations.\nWe are heavily dependent on third-party distributors to generate a substantial portion of international revenues and are at the risk of these distributors also selling for our competitors along with being financially viable to be able to effectively distribute our products and make timely payment.\nOutside of North America we rely heavily on third party distributors, either on a country-by-country basis or on a multi-country, regional basis, to market, sell and distribute our products. International distributors accounted for approximately 68% of international revenues for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. In certain circumstances, distributors may also sell competing products, or products for competing diagnostic modalities, and may have incentives to shift sales towards those competing products. As a result, we cannot assure you that our international distributors will increase or maintain our current levels of unit sales or increase or maintain our current unit pricing, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, there is a risk that our distributors will not be financially viable due to current economic and/or regulatory events in their respective countries.\nWe rely on distributors for the commercialization of our products in countries in which we do not have a direct sales and marketing presence. If we are unable to maintain our relationships or establish direct sales capabilities, our sales may significantly decline, materially impacting our financial position and results of operations.\nWe have no or limited direct sales or marketing capabilities in some of the regions and countries in which our products are sold, including, among others, China, Japan, Brazil, the Middle East and many European countries. We have entered into distribution agreements with third parties to market and sell our products in those countries in which we do not have a direct sales force. If we are unable to maintain or enter into such distribution arrangements on acceptable terms, or at all, we may lose significant revenue or be unable to achieve our growth aspirations. Moreover, to the extent that we enter into distribution arrangements with other companies, our revenues, if any, will depend on the terms of any such arrangements and the efforts of others. These efforts may turn out not to be sufficient and our third-party distributors may not effectively sell our products. In addition, although our contract terms require our distributors to comply with all applicable laws regarding the sale of our products, including anti-competition, anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and sanctions laws, we may not be able to ensure proper compliance. If our distributors fail to effectively market and sell our products in full compliance with applicable laws, our financial position and results of operations could be materially impacted.\nFailure to secure adequate reimbursement for our products could materially impair our ability to grow revenue and drive profitability.\nOur products are used in medical procedures generally covered by government or private health plans.\nIn general, a third-party payor only covers a medical product or procedure when the plan administrator is satisfied that the product or procedure improves health outcomes, including quality of life or functional ability, in a safe and cost-effective manner. Even if a device has received clearance or approval for marketing by the FDA, there is no assurance that third-party payors will cover the cost of the device and related procedures.\nIn many instances, third-party payors use price schedules that do not vary to reflect the cost of the products and equipment used in performing those procedures. In other instances, payment or reimbursement is separately available for the products and equipment used, in addition to payment or reimbursement for the procedure itself. Even if coverage is available, third-party payors may place restrictions on the circumstances where they provide coverage or may offer reimbursement that is not sufficient to cover the cost of our products.\nThird-party payors who cover the cost of medical products or equipment, in addition to allowing a general charge for the procedure, often maintain lists of exclusive suppliers or approved lists of products deemed to be cost-effective. Authorization from those third-party payors is required prior to using products that are not on these lists as a condition of reimbursement. If our products are not on the approved lists, healthcare providers must determine if the additional cost and effort required in obtaining prior authorization, and the uncertainty of actually obtaining coverage, is justified by any perceived clinical benefits from using our products.\nFinally, the advent of contracted fixed rates per procedure has made it difficult to receive reimbursement for disposable products, even if the use of these products improves clinical outcomes. In addition, many third-party payors are moving to managed care systems in which providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person. Managed care providers often attempt to control the cost of healthcare by authorizing fewer elective surgical procedures. Under current prospective payment systems, such as the diagnosis related group system and the hospital out-patient prospective payment system, both of which are used by Medicare and in many managed care systems used by private third-party payors, the cost of our products will be incorporated into the overall cost of a procedure and not be separately reimbursed. As a result, we cannot be certain that hospital administrators and physicians will purchase our products, despite the clinical benefits and opportunity for cost savings that we believe can be derived from their use. If hospitals and physicians cannot obtain adequate reimbursement for our products or the procedures in which they are used, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could suffer a material adverse impact.\nOur success in international markets will depend largely upon the availability of reimbursement from the third-party payors through which healthcare providers are paid in those markets. Reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country. The main types of healthcare payment systems are government sponsored healthcare and private insurance. Reimbursement approval must be obtained individually in each country in which our products are marketed. Outside the United States, we generally rely on our distributors to obtain reimbursement approval in the countries in which they will sell our products. There can be no assurance that reimbursement approvals will be received. The failure to secure reimbursement approvals in international markets could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nIf a product liability claim is brought against us or our product liability insurance coverage is inadequate, our business could be harmed.\nThe design, manufacture and marketing of the types of medical devices we sell entail an inherent risk of product liability. Our products are used by physicians to treat seriously ill patients. We are periodically subject to product liability claims, and patients or customers may in the future bring claims against us in a number of circumstances and for a number of reasons, including if our products were misused, if a component of our product fails, if our manufacture or design was flawed, if the product produced unsatisfactory results or if the instructions for use and operating manuals and disclosure of product related risks for our products were found to be inadequate. In addition, individuals or groups seeking to represent a class may file suit against us. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, including not only actual damages, but also punitive damages. The magnitude of the potential losses relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time.\nWe carry a product liability policy with a limit of $10.0 million per product liability claim and an aggregate policy limit of $10.0 million, subject to a self-insured retention of $0.5 million per occurrence and $2.0 million in the aggregate. We believe, based on claims made against us in the past, our existing product liability insurance coverage is reasonably adequate to protect us from any liabilities we might incur. However, there is no assurance that this coverage will be sufficient to satisfy any claim made against us. In addition, we may not be able to continue to maintain adequate coverage at a reasonable cost and on reasonable terms, if at all. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing any coverage in the future. Additionally, if one or more product liability claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or is in excess of our insurance coverage, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted. Further, such claims may require us to recall some of our products, which could result in significant costs to us and could divert management\u2019s attention from our business.\nWe may be exposed to risks associated with acquisitions, including integration risks and risks associated with methods of financing. Accordingly, completed acquisitions may not enhance our financial position or results of operations or create value for our shareholders as they are based on projections and assumptions which are uncertain and subject to change.\nPart of our growth strategy is to acquire businesses and technologies that are complementary to ours. There is no assurance that acquisition opportunities will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, or that we will be able to obtain necessary financing or regulatory approvals. Any acquisitions that we do undertake would be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions, including the:\n\u2022potential disruption of our business while we evaluate opportunities, complete acquisitions and develop and implement new business strategies to take advantage of these opportunities;\n\u2022inability of our management to maximize our financial and strategic position by incorporating an acquired technology or business into our existing offerings;\n\u2022inability to achieve the cost savings and operating synergies anticipated in the acquisition, which would prevent us from achieving the positive earnings gains expected as a result of the acquisition;\n\u2022diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns to integration matters;\n\u2022difficulty of maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022challenges in demonstrating to our customers that the acquisition will not result in adverse changes in customer service standards or business focus;\n\u2022possible cash flow interruption or loss of revenue as a result of change of ownership transition matters;\n\u2022difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired businesses;\n\u2022potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses, and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes in management; and\n\u2022uncertainty as to the long-term success of any acquisitions we may make including the impact on contingent liabilities.\nThere is no assurance that any completed acquisition will be accretive to our margins or profits in the short term or in the long term. If we proceed with one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration consists of cash, a substantial portion of our available cash could be used to consummate the acquisitions. If we consummate one or more acquisitions in which the consideration consists of capital stock, our stockholders could suffer significant dilution of their interest in us. In addition, we could incur or assume significant amounts of indebtedness in connection with acquisitions. Further, acquisitions could also result in significant goodwill and/or amortization charges for acquired businesses or technologies.\nFailure to attract additional capital which we may require to expand our business could curtail our growth.\nWe may require additional capital to expand our business. If cash generated internally is insufficient to fund capital requirements, we will require additional debt or equity financing. In addition, we may require financing to fund any significant\nacquisitions we may seek to make. Needed financing may not be available or, if available, may not be available on terms satisfactory to us and may result in significant stockholder dilution. Covenants in our existing financing agreements may also restrict our ability to obtain additional debt financing. If we fail to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future, we could be forced to curtail our growth strategy by reducing or delaying capital expenditures and acquisitions, selling assets, restructuring our operations or refinancing our indebtedness.\nWe may never realize the expected benefits from the divestiture of our Fluid Management business. In addition, the divestiture of our Fluid Management business entails significant personnel, systems and infrastructure changes that could cause operational disruptions.\nThe divestiture of our Fluid Management business is part of a strategy to transform ourselves into a high growth, highly profitable, medical technology company. If we are unable to achieve our growth and profitability objectives due to competition, lack of acceptance of our products, failure to generate favorable clinical data or gain regulatory approvals, or other risks as described in this section, or due to other events, we will not be successful in transforming our business and may not see the appropriate market valuation. Moreover, our Fluid Management business generated substantial revenue, earnings and cash flow, which we have not replaced. While over time we expect to replace this revenue and cash flow by investing in, acquiring and accelerating higher margin revenue streams, there is a risk we will be unable to replace the revenue, earnings and cash flow that our Fluid Management business generated, or that the cost of such will be higher than expected. If we are unable to achieve our profit and growth objectives, such failure will be exacerbated by the loss of revenue, earnings and cash flow generated by our divested Fluid Management business, and could materially impact our financial position and results of operations, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nThe sale of our Fluid Management business required us to restructure significant personnel, systems and infrastructure. As part of this process, many long-term employees with valuable institutional knowledge were transitioned to Medline, and key systems were replicated or relocated across both companies. In some instances, existing processes and systems could not be fully replicated, requiring that we enter into short term transition service arrangements with Medline, and vice versa, under which the parties perform certain services for each other pending establishment of new processes and systems. Although these transitions were thoroughly planned, it is not unlikely in a transaction of this complexity that disruptions could occur. If disruptions to our financial controls, IT, administrative support, manufacturing or regulatory processes occur, and if such disruptions prove to be more severe than our planning anticipated, this could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nInternational and national economic and industry conditions constantly change, and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operation are affected by many changing economic, industry and other conditions beyond our control. Actual or potential changes in international, national, regional and local economic, business and financial conditions, including recession, inflation and trade protection measures, may negatively affect consumer preferences, perceptions, spending patterns or demographic trends, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations, which may adversely impact their ability or decision to purchase or pay for our products. Disruptions in the credit markets have previously resulted, and could again result, in volatility, decreased liquidity, widening of credit spreads, and reduced availability of financing. There can be no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. An inability to obtain necessary additional financing on acceptable terms may have an adverse impact on us and on our ability to execute on our business plan.\nWe are subject to a variety of market and financial risks due to our international operations that could adversely affect those operations or our profitability and operating results.\nOur stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and we are a global Company. Operations in countries outside of the U.S., which account for approximately 21% percent of our net sales for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020, are accompanied by certain financial and other risks that would not be faced by a company operating purely within the U.S. We intend to continue to pursue growth opportunities in sales outside the U.S., especially in emerging markets, which could expose us to greater risks associated with international sales and operations. Our profitability and international operations are, and will continue to be, subject to a number of risks and potential costs, including:\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022healthcare reform legislation;\n\u2022multiple non-U.S. regulatory requirement that are subject to change and could restrict our ability to manufacture and sell our products;\n\u2022local product preferences and product requirements;\n\u2022longer-term receivables than are typical in the U.S.;\n\u2022trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;\n\u2022less intellectual property protection in some countries outside the U.S. than exists in the U.S.;\n\u2022different labor regulations and workforce instability;\n\u2022political instability;\n\u2022the potential payment of U.S. income taxes on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries subject to U.S. taxation upon repatriation;\n\u2022the expiration and non-renewal of foreign tax rulings;\n\u2022potential negative consequences from changes in or interpretation of tax laws;\n\u2022economic instability and inflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations: and\n\u2022the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union (EU) (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) on January 31, 2020.\nThere are recent legislative proposals to tax profits of U.S. affiliates which are earned abroad. While it is impossible for us to predict whether these and other proposals will be implemented, or how they will ultimately impact us, they may materially impact our results of operations if, for example, our profits earned abroad are subject to U.S. income tax, or we are otherwise disallowed deductions as a result of these profits.\nFinally, changes in currency exchange rates may reduce the reported value of our revenues outside the U.S, net of expenses, and cash flows. We cannot predict changes in currency exchange rates, the impact of exchange rate changes, nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impact of currency exchange rate changes.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s departure from the EU, or Brexit, could adversely affect us.\nDuring June 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit. On January 24, 2020, the U.K. Parliament approved a withdrawal agreement (the \u201cWithdrawal Agreement\u201d) between the U.K. and the EU. On January 31, 2020, the U.K. exited the European Union and under the Withdrawal Agreement, the U.K. is subject to an eleven-month transition period (the \u201cTransition Period\u201d) by which to leave the single market and customs union.\nThe uncertainty concerning the U.K.\u2019s legal, political and economic relationship with the EU after the Transition Period could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound Sterling and Euro, which in turn could adversely affect us or our customers and companies that do business with us. Such uncertainties could also trigger a general deterioration in credit conditions, a downturn in consumer sentiment and overall negative economic growth. Any of these scenarios could have an adverse effect on our business or our customers.\nIf the U.K. and the EU are unable to negotiate acceptable trading and customs terms, barrier-free access between the U.K. and other EU member states could be diminished or eliminated. The long-term effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements (or lack thereof) between the U.K. and the EU and, in particular, any arrangements for the U.K. to retain access to EU markets after the Transition Period. Such a withdrawal from the EU is unprecedented, and it is unclear how the U.K.\u2019s access to the European single market for goods, capital, services and labor within the EU and the wider commercial, legal and regulatory environment, will impact our U.K. operations.\nIn addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and increased complexity as national laws and regulations in the U.K. start to diverge from EU laws and regulations. In particular, depending on the terms of Brexit, we may face new regulatory costs and challenges, including the following:\n\u2022if we are unable to utilize appropriate authorizations and regulator permissions, our U.K. and EU-based operations could lose their ability to offer services on a cross-border basis into the U.K. market and for our U.K. based operations to offer services on a cross-border basis in the EU market;\n\u2022we could be required to obtain additional regulatory permissions to operate in the U.K. and EU market, adding costs and potential inconsistency to our business (and, depending on the capacity of the U.K. authorities, the criteria for obtaining permission, and any possible transitional arrangements, there is a risk that our business in the U.K. could be materially affected or disrupted);\n\u2022we could be required to comply with regulatory requirements in the U.K. that are in addition to, or inconsistent with, the regulatory requirements of the EU, leading to increased complexity and costs for our EU and U.K. operations; and\n\u2022our ability to attract and retain the necessary human resources in appropriate locations to support the U.K. business and the EU business could be adversely impacted.\nThese and other factors related to Brexit could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nContinuing worldwide economic instability, including challenges faced by the Eurozone countries, could adversely affect our revenues, financial condition or results of operations.\nSince fiscal year 2008, the global economy has been impacted by the sequential effects of an ongoing global financial crisis. There can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in the global economy. Our customers and vendors may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability to purchase our products or to pay for our products on a timely basis, if at all. As with our customers and vendors, these economic conditions make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. In addition, trade receivables are in many countries. Repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the financial stability of the economies of those countries.\nIn light of these global economic fluctuations, we continue to monitor the creditworthiness of customers located outside the U.S. Failure to receive payment of all or a significant portion of these receivables could adversely affect our results of operations. Further, there are concerns for the overall stability and suitability of the Euro as a single currency, given the economic and political challenges facing individual Eurozone countries. Continuing deterioration in the creditworthiness of the Eurozone countries, the withdrawal of one or more member countries from the EU, or the failure of the Euro as a common European currency could adversely affect our revenues, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with worldwide economic slowdowns and related uncertainties.\nWe are subject to macro-economic fluctuations in the U.S. and worldwide economy. Concerns about consumer and investor confidence, volatile corporate profits and reduced capital spending, international conflicts, terrorist and military activity, civil unrest and pandemic illness could reduce customer orders or cause customer order cancellations. For example, the spread of coronavirus may cause adverse impacts on global economic activity which could negatively impact our business. In addition, political and social turmoil may put further pressure on economic conditions in the United States and abroad.\nOur business could be harmed if we lose the services of our key personnel.\nOur business depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, including managerial, sales and technical personnel. We compete for key personnel with other companies, healthcare institutions, academic institutions, government entities and other organizations. We do not have written employment agreements with our executive officers, other than the CEO. Our ability to maintain and expand our business may be impaired if we are unable to retain our current key personnel or hire or retain other qualified personnel in the future. In addition, our sales force is highly talented and there is competition in the sales industry which could have an adverse effect on our business if there is significant turnover.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth profitably, our business, financial results and stock price could suffer.\nOur future financial results will depend in part on our ability to profitably manage our growth. Management will need to maintain existing customers and attract new customers, recruit, retain and effectively manage employees, as well as expand operations and integrate customer support and financial control systems. If integration-related expenses and capital expenditure requirements are greater than anticipated or if we are unable to manage our growth profitably, our financial results and the market price of our common stock may decline.\nIn recent years we have begun to implement our operational excellence initiatives which include a number of restructuring, realignment and cost reduction initiatives. While we have realized some efficiencies from these actions, we may not realize the benefits of these initiatives to the extent we anticipated. Further, such benefits may be realized later than expected, and the ongoing difficulties in implementing these measures may be greater than anticipated, which could cause us to incur additional costs or result in business disruptions. In addition, if these measures are not successful or sustainable, we may undertake additional realignment and cost reduction efforts, which could result in significant additional charges. Moreover, if our restructuring and realignment efforts prove ineffective, our ability to achieve our other strategic goals and business plans may be adversely affected.\nWe may incur indebtedness which could impose operating and financial restrictions on us as a result of debt service obligations which could significantly limit our ability to execute our business strategy.\nWe may incur indebtedness in the future subject to limitations contained in the agreements governing our debt. The interest rate on potential borrowings could be a floating rate which could expose us to the risk of increased interest expense in the future. The terms of a credit facility could require us to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants. In addition, the terms of our indebtedness could also include certain covenants restricting or limiting our ability to take certain actions.\nThese covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities or take certain corporate actions. The covenants could also restrict our flexibility in planning for changes in our business and the industry and could make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments.\nOur ability to meet our cash requirements, including our debt service obligations, could be dependent upon our operating performance, which would be subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which could be beyond our control. We cannot provide assurance that our business operations would generate sufficient cash flows from operations to fund potential cash requirements and debt service obligations. If our operating results, cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt and other obligations. If we incurred indebtedness and were unable to service our debt, we could be forced to reduce or delay planned expansions and capital expenditures, sell assets, restructure or refinance our debt or seek additional equity capital, and we could be unable to take any of these actions on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner. Further, any of these actions may not be sufficient to allow us to service our potential debt obligations or could have an adverse impact on our business. Our potential debt agreements could limit our ability to take certain of these actions. Our failure to generate sufficient operating cash flow to pay our potential debts or to successfully undertake any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn addition, the degree to which we are leveraged as a result of potential indebtedness incurred in connection with an acquisition or otherwise could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or other purposes, could make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic, regulatory and industry conditions, could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in the markets in which we compete, could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt.\nOur international sales and operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that vary by country and could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.\nSales outside the United States accounted for approximately 21% of our net sales during our fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a significant portion of our total sales, and we intend to continue our expansion into emerging and/or faster-growing markets outside the United States. Our sales and profitability from our international operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that can vary by country, and include those related to political and economic conditions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changes in tax laws, regulatory and reimbursement programs and policies, and the protection of intellectual property rights. These risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.\nForeign currency exchange rate may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Products manufactured in, and sold into, foreign markets represent a significant portion of our operations. When the United States dollar strengthens or weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which we sell our products, such as the Euro, our United States dollar-reported revenue and income will fluctuate. The effects of currency rate fluctuations and changes in the relative values of currencies may, in some instances, have a significant effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets are subject to potential impairment.\nA significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired. Included in the intangible assets, are intangible assets from the recent acquisitions of Eximo Medical Ltd. for $60.3 million, BioSentry for $26.0 million, RadiaDyne (OARtrac, IsoLoc\u00ae and Alatus\u00ae balloons) for $25.6 million and C3 Wave tip location for $9.4 million.\nMost of our intangible and fixed assets have finite useful lives and are amortized or depreciated over their useful lives on either a straight-line basis or over the expected period of benefit or as revenues are earned from the sales of the related products. The underlying assumptions regarding the estimated useful lives of these intangible assets are reviewed quarterly and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable and are adjusted through accelerated amortization if necessary. Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable we test intangible assets for impairment based on estimates of future cash flows. When testing for impairment of definite-lived intangible assets held for use, the Company groups assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. The Company operates as a single asset group. If an intangible asset is considered to be impaired, the amount of the impairment will equal the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset.\nWe review our single reporting unit for potential goodwill impairment in the third fiscal quarter of each year as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing, and more often if an event or circumstance occurs making it likely that impairment exists. We conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations. The annual goodwill impairment review performed in December 2019 indicated no goodwill impairments. As a result of the current economic environment and the impact that the COVID-19 global pandemic has had on the global capital markets and the fact that the Company's market capitalization is below its reporting unit's carrying value as of May 31, 2020, the Company performed an interim test for goodwill impairment as of May 31, 2020. As a result of the interim impairment test, a $158.6 million goodwill impairment charge was recorded as of May 31, 2020.\nIf actual results differ from the assumptions and estimates used in the goodwill and intangible asset calculations, we could incur future impairment or amortization charges, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe have recorded significant goodwill impairment charges and may be required to record additional charges to future earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired.\nWe are required under generally accepted accounting principles to review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets and/or goodwill may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, slower growth rates in our industry or our own operations, and/or other materially adverse events that have implications on the profitability of our business. In fiscal year 2020, we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of $158.6 million. We may be required to record additional charges to earnings during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets is determined which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe may be limited in our ability to utilize, or may not be able to utilize, net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our future tax liability.\nIRC Section 382 and related provisions contain rules that limit for U.S. federal income tax purposes the ability of a Company that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes existing as of the date of such ownership change. Our Federal net operating loss carryforwards as of May 31, 2020 after considering IRC Section 382 limitations are $112.3 million. The expiration of the Federal net operating loss carryforwards is as follows: $8.6 million between 2022 and 2023, $79.4 million between 2028 and 2037 and $24.3 million indefinitely. Our state net operating loss carryforwards as of May 31, 2020 after considering remaining IRC Section 382 limitations are $9.3 million which expire in various years from 2020 to 2040. Future ownership changes within the meaning of IRC Section 382 may also subject our tax loss carryforwards to annual limitations which would restrict our ability to use them to offset our taxable income in periods following the ownership changes.\nSee Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020 for a further discussion of our tax loss carryovers.\nFluctuations in our effective tax rate and changes to tax laws may adversely affect us.\nAs an international company, we are subject to taxation in numerous countries, states and other jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various countries, states and other jurisdictions in which we operate. In preparing our financial statements, we estimate the amount of tax that will become payable in each of these jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate may, however, differ from the estimated amount due to numerous factors, including a change in the mix of our profitability from country to country and changes in tax laws. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous periods or our current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on the proper function, availability and security of information technology systems to operate our business as a cyber-attack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to cyber-attacks, malicious intrusions, breakdowns, destructions, losses of data privacy, or other significant disruptions. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information, and changing customer patterns. In addition, third parties may attempt to hack into our products to obtain data relating to patients\nwith our products or our proprietary information. Any failure by us to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions or other breaches, could result in the unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Any of these events, in turn, may cause us to lose existing customers, have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians, and other health care professionals, be subject to legal claims and liability, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or theft of intellectual property, or suffer other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAny disaster at our manufacturing facilities could disrupt our ability to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time, which could cause our revenues to decrease.\nWe conduct our manufacturing and assembly at facilities in Queensbury, New York and Glens Falls, New York. It would be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to transfer resources from one facility to the other, replace, or repair these facilities and our manufacturing equipment if they were significantly affected by a disaster. Additionally, we might be forced to rely on third-party manufacturers or to delay production of our products. Insurance for damage to our properties and the disruption of our business from disasters may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, if one of our principal suppliers were to experience a similar disaster, uninsured loss or under-insured loss, we might not be able to obtain adequate alternative sources of supplies or products or could face significant delays and incur substantial expense in doing so. Any significant uninsured loss, prolonged or repeated disruption, or inability to operate experienced by us or any of our principal suppliers could cause significant harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nManufacturing and assembly takes place in Queensbury, New York and Glens Falls, New York. If we were significantly affected by a disaster, we no longer have an option to transfer manufacturing to another facility so we would be forced to rely on third-party manufacturers or would have to delay production of our products.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could cause our stock price to decline and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may enable our management to resist a change in control. These provisions may discourage, delay or prevent a change in the ownership of our Company or a change in our management. In addition, these provisions could limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Such provisions include:\n\u2022Our Board of Directors is authorized, without prior stockholder approval, to create and issue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, with rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u2022Our Board of Directors is classified so that not all members of our Board of Directors are elected at one time, which may make it more difficult for a person who acquires control of a majority of our outstanding voting stock to replace our directors;\n\u2022Advance notice is required for stockholders to nominate individuals to serve on our Board of Directors or for stockholders to submit proposals that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings;\n\u2022Stockholder action by written consent is prohibited; and\n\u2022Stockholders are not permitted to cumulatively vote for the election of directors.\nWe are also subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock.\nThese and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our Board of Directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current Board of Directors, including delaying or impeding a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving our Company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our Board of Directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe are dependent on the proper functioning of our critical facilities, our supply chain and distribution networks and our sales force as well as the financial stability of our customers, all of which could be negatively impacted by the coronavirus in a manner that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to manufacture products may be materially adversely impacted by the coronavirus.\nThe Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) (\u201ccoronavirus\u201d) is impacting worldwide economic activity. Estimates for economic growth have been reduced as a result of the coronavirus, which may have a corresponding effect on our sales activity. The virus continues to spread globally, has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and has spread to over 100 countries, including the United States. The impact of this pandemic has been and will likely continue to be extensive in many aspects of society, which has resulted in and will likely continue to result in significant disruptions to the global economy, as well as businesses and capital markets around the world. With the spread of the coronavirus to the United States and other countries, it is unclear how economic activity and work flows might be impacted on a worldwide basis. Many employers in the United States are requiring their employees to work from home or not come into their offices or facilities. We manufacture primarily out of one facility in Queensbury, New York, and partially out of a facility in Glens Falls, New York. If the manufacturing capabilities of these two sites are impacted as a result of the coronavirus, it may not be possible for us to timely manufacture relevant products at required levels or at all. A reduction or interruption in any of our manufacturing processes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe also might be unable to obtain products, product components, or sterilized products from our suppliers and vendors due to the additional constraints on suppliers created by the coronavirus. Any delays in delivery of or shortages in products and components could interrupt and delay manufacturing of our products and result in the cancellation of orders for our products.\nOur sales may be materially adversely impacted by the coronavirus.\nOur sales force functions by meeting in person with physicians and health care providers to discuss our products. The coronavirus may negatively affect demand for our products by limiting the ability of our sales personnel to maintain their customary contacts with customers for a period of time. We may also find that distributors will have to prioritize their work load and may be forced to slow their activities as a result of the coronavirus. As a result, we cannot assure you that our sales force or distributors will increase or maintain our current levels of unit sales or increase or maintain our current unit pricing, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, there is a risk that our international distributors will not be financially viable due to the impact of coronavirus in their respective countries.\nWe may also experience significant and unpredictable reductions in demand for certain products as our health care customers re-prioritize the treatment of patients and divert resources away from non-coronavirus areas. For example, elective surgeries are being de-prioritized which may negatively impact the usage of certain products, including, without limitation, our EVLT and core products and certain Oncology products. As a result of coronavirus, our customers and vendors may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations, which may adversely impact their ability to purchase our products or pay for our products on a timely basis, if at all.\nThe execution of our clinical studies may be materially adversely impacted by the coronavirus.\nOur future business prospects are highly dependent on generating, collecting and disseminating data pursuant to clinical trials. Clinical trials, including, without limitation, our DIRECT Study, studying the use of NanoKnife to treat pancreatic cancer, and our Pathfinder Registry, collecting data on the use of our Atherectomy laser, may be materially impacted by the coronavirus as hospitals prioritize treating coronavirus patients and creating capacity. Delays in the initiation of sites or enrollment of patients in these and other clinical studies, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and future business prospects.\nOur ability to raise capital may be materially adversely impacted by the coronavirus.\nAny sustained disruption in the capital markets from the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our ability to raise capital. As of the end of our fiscal year ended May 31, 2020 we have a strong balance sheet and do not anticipate the need to raise additional capital. However, we cannot predict when the macro-economic disruption stemming from the coronavirus will ebb or when the economy will return to pre-coronavirus levels, if at all. If the macro-economic disruption continues for pro-longed periods we may need to raise additional capital and capital may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all.\nThe impact of the coronavirus on economic activity, and its effect on our manufacturing facility, supply chain and distribution networks, our sales force and our customers are uncertain at this time and could have a material adverse effect on our results, especially to the extent these effects persist or exacerbate over an extended period of time.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\nReforms to the United States healthcare system may adversely affect our business.\nIn response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years, there have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payers to control these costs and, more generally, to reform\nthe health care system, including U.S. health care reform legislation. Certain of these proposals could, among other things, limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products. The adoption of some or all of these proposals could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities, which has led to certain costs and business distractions as we respond to inquiries and comply with new regulations, and may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future.\nOur medical devices and our business activities are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. These authorities and members of Congress have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry. In addition, certain states, including Massachusetts, have recently passed or are considering legislation restricting our interactions with health care providers and requiring disclosure of many payments to them. The federal government has recently introduced similar legislation, which may or may not preempt state laws. Recent Supreme Court case law has clarified that the FDA\u2019s authority over medical devices preempts state tort laws, but legislation has been introduced at the federal level to allow state intervention, which could lead to increased and inconsistent regulation at the state level. We anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely, and that additional regulation by governmental authorities may increase compliance costs, increase exposure to litigation and may have other adverse effects to our operations.\nWe are subject to a comprehensive system of federal, state and international laws and regulations, and we could be the subject of investigations, enforcement actions or face lawsuits and monetary or equitable judgments.\nWe operate in many parts of the world, and our operations are affected by complex state, federal and international laws relating to healthcare, environmental protection, antitrust, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, fraud and abuse, export control, tax, employment and laws regarding privacy, personally identifiable information and protected health information, including, for example, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDCA\u201d), various FDA and international regulations relating to, among other things, the development, quality assurance, manufacturing, importation, distribution, marketing and sale of, and billing for, our products, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and Federal False Claims Act (Note 17), the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the UK Bribery Act of 2010, the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\") and other foreign data protection and privacy laws, and laws and regulations relating to sanctions and money laundering. We are subject to periodic inspections to determine compliance with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation requirements, current medical device adverse event reporting regulations, and similar foreign rules and regulations. Despite our training and compliance programs, our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from negligent, reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. The failure to comply with these laws and regulatory standards, allegations of such non-compliance or the discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer: (i) could result in FDA Form-483 notices and/or warning letters or the foreign equivalent, fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, investigations, detainment, seizures or recalls of products (with the attendant expenses), the banning of a particular device, an order to replace or refund the cost of any device previously manufactured or distributed, operating restrictions and/or civil or criminal prosecution, and/or penalties, as well as decreased sales as a result of negative publicity and product liability claims; and (ii) could disrupt our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nMost of our products must receive clearance or approval from the FDA or comparable regulatory agencies abroad before they can be marketed or sold. State, federal and foreign registration regulations are both evolving and subject to varied levels of interpretation and enforcement. It can be costly and time-consuming to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals to market a medical device. Approvals might not be granted on a timely basis, if at all, for new devices, new indications for use or certain modifications or enhancements to previously approved products. Even after a device receives regulatory approval it remains subject to significant regulatory and quality requirements, such as manufacturing, recordkeeping, renewal, recertification or reporting and other post market approval requirements, which may include clinical, laboratory or other studies. Product approvals by the FDA and other foreign regulators can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial approval or may be re-classified to a higher regulatory classification, such as requiring a Pre-Market Approval (\u201cPMA\u201d) for a previously cleared 510(k) device. Regulations are also subject to change as a result of legislative, administrative or judicial action, which may further increase our costs or reduce sales. Our failure to maintain approvals, obtain approval for new products or comply with other applicable regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nThe healthcare industry is under continued scrutiny from state, federal and international governments with respect to industry practices in the area of sales and marketing, including provisions of the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. If our marketing, sales or other activities fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s or other comparable foreign regulatory agencies\u2019 regulations or guidelines, or other applicable laws, we may be subject to warnings from the FDA or investigations or enforcement actions\nfrom the FDA, Medicare, the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services or other government agencies or enforcement bodies. Additionally, in the European Union, a new draft Medical Device Regulation was published in 2016 imposing stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices and grants Notified Bodies increased post-market surveillance authority. The Company is monitoring the implementation of the regulation and has undertaken initial actions to move toward compliance based on the published draft of the regulation. The Company\u2019s failure to comply with any marketing or sales regulations or any other applicable regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nIn the recent past, medical device manufacturers have been the subject of investigations from government agencies related to their relationships with doctors, product sales and marketing and off-label promotion of products, among other activities or practices. If an enforcement action involving the Company were to occur, it could result in penalties, fines, detainment, seizures, recalls, product bans, operating restrictions (which may include loss of a license or authorization), the exclusion of our products from reimbursement under government-funded programs and/or prohibitions on our ability to sell our products, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. In addition, remediation of any issues identified by the FDA or other regulators could require facility upgrades, process changes, additional labeling requirements or other measures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and/or results of operations.\nIn addition, lawsuits by or otherwise involving employees, customers, licensors, licensees, suppliers, vendors, business partners, distributors, shareholders or competitors with respect to how we conduct our business could be very costly and could substantially disrupt our business. Disputes from time-to-time with companies or individuals are not uncommon, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to resolve these disputes on terms favorable to us. The occurrence of an adverse monetary or equitable judgment or a large expenditure in connection with a settlement of any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\nWe are subject to data privacy and protection regulations and laws globally, and could face substantial penalties if we fail to comply with such regulations and laws.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data, including Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These laws and regulations regarding the handling of personal data are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation and can include significant penalties for non-compliance. We could be required to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices.\nFailure to comply with laws relating to the handling and transmission of electronic health data may require us to make significant changes to our products, or incur penalties or other liabilities.\nState, federal and foreign laws, such as the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), regulate the confidentiality of personally identifiable health information and other sensitive personal information and the circumstances under which such information may be released. These measures may govern the disclosure and use of personal and patient medical record information and may require users of such information to implement specified technical, administrative and security measures, and to notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches. Evolving laws and regulations in this area could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products or systems and procedures which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Failure to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive personal information in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements, or to abide by electronic health data transmission standards, could expose us to breach of contract claims, fines and penalties, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.\nWe are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulations that could result in significant liability, require us to change our business practices and restrict our operations in the future.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and health programs outside the United States. These laws and regulations are wide ranging and subject to changing interpretation and application, which could restrict our sales or marketing practices. Furthermore, since many of our customers rely on reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental programs to cover a substantial portion of their expenditures, our exclusion from such programs as a result of a violation of these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.\nIf we or some of our suppliers fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, and other applicable post-market requirements, our manufacturing operations could be disrupted, our product sales and profitability could suffer, and we may be subject to a wide variety of FDA enforcement actions.\nAfter a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. We are subject to inspection and marketing surveillance by the FDA to determine our compliance with all regulatory requirements. Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in the FDA or a court instituting a wide variety of enforcement actions against us, including a public \"Warning Letter\"; an order to shut down some or all manufacturing operations; a recall of products; fines or civil penalties; seizure or detention of our products; refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or a PMA of new or modified products; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals already granted to us; and criminal prosecution.\nOur manufacturing processes and those of some of our suppliers must comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which governs the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, testing, manufacture, control, quality assurance, installation, servicing, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping of medical devices. The FDA enforces the QSR through unannounced inspections. If we, or one of our suppliers, fail a QSR inspection, or if a corrective action plan adopted by us or one of our suppliers is not sufficient, the FDA may bring an enforcement action, and our operations could be disrupted and our manufacturing delayed. We are also subject to the FDA\u2019s general prohibition against promoting our products for unapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d uses, the FDA\u2019s adverse event reporting requirements and the FDA\u2019s reporting requirements for field correction or product removals. The FDA has recently placed increased emphasis on its scrutiny of compliance with the QSR and these other post-market requirements.\nIf we, or one of our suppliers, violate the FDA\u2019s requirements or fail to take adequate corrective action in response to any significant compliance issue raised by the FDA, the FDA can take various enforcement actions which could cause our product sales and profitability to suffer.\nIn addition, most other countries require us and our suppliers to comply with manufacturing and quality assurance standards for medical devices that are similar to those in force in the United States before marketing and selling our products in those countries. If we, or our suppliers, should fail to do so, we would lose our ability to market and sell our products in those countries.\nIf we cannot obtain and maintain marketing clearance or approval from governmental agencies, we will not be able to sell our products.\nOur products are medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and in the foreign countries in which they are sold. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device that we wish to market in the United States must receive either 510(k) clearance or premarket approval (PMA) from the FDA before the product can be sold. Either process can be lengthy and expensive. The FDA\u2019s 510(k) clearance procedure, also known as \u201cpremarket notification,\u201d is the process we have used for our current products. This process usually takes from four to twelve months from the date the premarket notification is submitted to the FDA, but may take significantly longer. Although we have obtained 510(k) clearances for our current products, our clearances may be revoked by the FDA if safety or effectiveness problems develop with the devices. The PMA process is much more costly, lengthy and uncertain. It generally takes from one to three years from the date the application is submitted to, and filed with the FDA, and may take even longer. Regulatory regimes in other countries similarly require approval or clearance prior to our marketing or selling products in those countries. We rely on our distributors to obtain regulatory clearances or approvals of our products outside of the United States. If we are unable to obtain additional clearances or approvals needed to market existing or new products in the United States or elsewhere or obtain these clearances or approvals in a timely fashion or at all, or if our existing clearances are revoked, our revenues and profitability may decline.\nModifications to our current products may require new marketing clearances or approvals or require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until such clearances or approvals are obtained.\nAny modification to an FDA-cleared medical device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, requires a new FDA 510(k) clearance or, possibly, a premarket approval. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make its own determination as to whether a modification requires a new 510(k) clearance or premarket approval, but the FDA may review and disagree with any decision reached by the manufacturer. We have modified aspects of some of our devices since receiving regulatory clearance. We believed that some of these modifications did not require new 510(k) clearance or premarket approval and, therefore, we did not seek new 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals. In the future, we may make additional modifications to our products after they have received FDA clearance or approval and, in appropriate circumstances, determine that new clearance or approval is unnecessary. Regulations in other countries in which we market or sell, or propose to market or sell, may also require that we make judgments about changes to our products and whether or not those changes are such that regulatory approval or clearance should be obtained. In the United States and elsewhere, regulatory authorities may disagree with our past or future decisions not\nto seek new clearance or approval and may require us to obtain clearance or approval for modifications to our products. If that were to occur for a previously cleared or approved product, we may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain the necessary clearance or approval. Under these circumstances, we may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or other penalties. If any of the foregoing were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nEven after receiving regulatory clearance or approval, our products may be subject to product recalls, which may harm our reputation and divert managerial and financial resources.\nThe FDA and similar governmental authorities in other countries have the authority to order mandatory recall of our products or order their removal from the market if there are material deficiencies or defects in design, manufacture, installation, servicing or labeling of the device, or if the governmental entity finds that our products would cause serious adverse health consequences. A government mandated voluntary recall or field action by us could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors or design defects, including labeling defects. Any recall of our products may harm our reputation with customers and divert managerial and financial resources. In fiscal year 2020, we did a voluntary recall of the OARtrac product, that was acquired as part of the RadiaDyne acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, to address installation issues that were identified once the product was placed in the field.\nWe may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions or costly investigations if we are determined to be promoting the use of our products for unapproved or \u201coff-label\u201d uses.\nIf we are incorrect in our belief that our promotional materials and training methods regarding physicians are conducted in compliance with regulations of the FDA and other applicable regulations, and the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved use, the FDA could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nIf our employees or agents violate the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, we may incur fines or penalties, or experience other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar anti-bribery laws in international jurisdictions, including the UK Anti-Bribery Act, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Because of the predominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, many of our customer relationships outside of the United States are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. Our sales to customers and distributors outside of the United States have been increasing and we expect them to continue to increase in the future. If our employees or agents violate the provisions of the FCPA or other anti-bribery laws, we may incur fines or penalties, we may be unable to market our products in other countries or we may experience other adverse consequences which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition.\nLaws and regulations governing the export of our products could adversely impact our business. If the U.S. government imposes strict sanctions on Iran, our revenue could be impacted.\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and the Bureau of Industry and Security at the U.S. Department of Commerce (BIS), administer certain laws and regulations that restrict U.S. persons and, in some instances, non-U.S. persons, in conducting activities, transacting business with or making investments in certain countries, governments, entities and individuals subject to U.S. economic sanctions. Due to our international operations, we are subject to such laws and regulations, which are complex, restrict our business dealings with certain countries and individuals, and are constantly changing. Further restrictions may be enacted, amended, enforced or interpreted in a manner that materially impacts our operations.\nIn fiscal year 2020 we generated $1.8 million of revenue for sales to distributors doing business in Iran. We continuously review our ability to sell products to distributors that conduct business in Iran in accordance with all applicable U.S. laws. If laws, rules or regulations of the United States with respect to doing business in, or with parties that do business in, Iran change to restrict our ability to generate revenue in Iran, our revenue could decline, impacting our results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we have limited business dealings in countries subject to comprehensive sanctions. These business dealings may expose us to a heightened risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations. Violations of these regulations are\npunishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment. We have established policies and procedures designed to assist with our compliance with such laws and regulations. However, there can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will effectively prevent us from violating these regulations in every transaction in which we may engage, and such a violation could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in reimbursement levels by governmental or other third-party payors for procedures using our products may cause our revenues to decline.\nOur products are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians which typically bill various third-party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g. Medicare, Medicaid and comparable foreign programs), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of our customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for products and services from third-party payors is critical to the success of medical device companies because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement varies by country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new technology. Implementation of healthcare reforms in the United States and in other countries may limit, reduce or eliminate reimbursement for our products and adversely affect both our pricing flexibility and the demand for our products. Even when we develop a promising new product, we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third party payors.\nThird-party payors have adopted, and are continuing to adopt, a number of healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs. These policies include:\n\u2022controls on government-funded reimbursement for healthcare services and price controls on medical products and services providers;\n\u2022challenges to the pricing of medical procedures or limits or prohibitions on reimbursement for specific devices and therapies through other means; and\n\u2022the introduction of managed care systems in which healthcare providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person.\nWe are unable to predict whether federal, state or local healthcare reform legislation or regulation affecting our business may be proposed or enacted in the future, or what effect any such legislation or regulation would have on our business. Changes in healthcare systems in the United States or elsewhere in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or denies coverage for these procedures, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement issues, would have an adverse impact on the acceptance of our products and the prices which our customers are willing to pay for them.\nRISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, we may not be able to generate revenues from new or existing products and our business may suffer.\nOur success depends in part on obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights, and our ability to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others. We take precautionary steps to protect our technological advantages and intellectual property. We rely upon patent, trade secret, copyright, know-how and trademark laws, as well as license agreements and contractual provisions, to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our products. However, no assurances can be made that any pending or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that any current or future patents issued to, or licensed by, us will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors, or that our patents will not be found invalid.\nPatent positions of medical device companies, including our Company, are uncertain and involve complex and evolving legal and factual questions. The coverage sought in a patent application can be denied or significantly reduced either before or after the patent is issued. Consequently, there can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will result in an issued patent. There is also no assurance that any existing or future patent will provide significant protection or commercial advantage, or whether any existing or future patent will be circumvented by a more basic patent, thus requiring us to obtain a license to produce and sell the product. Generally, patent applications can be maintained in secrecy for at least 18 months after their earliest priority date. In addition, publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to invent the subject matter covered by each of our pending U.S. patent applications or that we were the first to file non-U.S. patent applications for such subject matter.\nAdditionally, we rely on trade secret protection for certain unpatented aspects of our proprietary technology. There can be no assurance that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques, that others will not gain access to our proprietary technology or disclose such technology, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets. We have a policy of requiring key employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. Our confidentiality agreements also require our employees to assign to us all rights to any inventions made or conceived during their employment with us. We also generally require our consultants to assign to us any inventions made during the course of their engagement by us. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for us in the event of unauthorized use, transfer or disclosure of confidential information or inventions.\nIf we are not able to adequately protect our intellectual property, our market share, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.\nIf third parties claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights, we may be forced to expend significant financial resources and management time defending against such actions and our financial condition and our results of operations could suffer.\nThird parties may claim that our products infringe their patents and other intellectual property rights. Identifying third-party patent rights can be particularly difficult because, in general, patent applications can be maintained in secrecy for at least 18 months after their earliest priority date. Some companies in the medical device industry have used intellectual property infringement litigation to gain a competitive advantage. If a competitor were to challenge our patents, licenses or other intellectual property rights, or assert that our products infringe its patent or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial litigation costs, be forced to make expensive changes to our product design, pay royalties or other fees to license rights in order to continue manufacturing and selling our products, or pay substantial damages. Third-party infringement claims, regardless of their outcome, would not only consume our financial resources but also divert our management\u2019s time and effort. Such claims could also cause our customers or potential customers to purchase competitors\u2019 products or defer or limit their purchase or use of our affected products until resolution of the claim. See Note 17 in the consolidated financial statements.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR STOCK PRICE\nOur future operating results are difficult to predict and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, which may adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe ongoing introduction of new products and services that affect our overall product mix make the prediction of future operating results difficult. You should not rely on our past results as any indication of future operating results. The price of our common stock will likely fall in the event that our operating results do not meet the expectations of analysts and investors. Comparisons of our quarterly operating results are an unreliable indication of our future performance because they are likely to vary significantly based on many factors, including:\n\u2022the level of sales of our products and services in our markets;\n\u2022our ability to introduce new products or services and enhancements in a timely manner;\n\u2022the demand for and acceptance of our products and services;\n\u2022the success of our competition and the introduction of alternative products or services;\n\u2022our ability to command favorable pricing for our products and services;\n\u2022the growth of the market for our devices and services;\n\u2022the expansion and rate of success of our direct sales force in the United States and internationally and our independent distributors internationally;\n\u2022actions relating to ongoing FDA compliance;\n\u2022our ability to integrate acquired assets or companies;\n\u2022our ability to timely divest of assets that are covered by Transition Service Agreements;\n\u2022the effect of intellectual property disputes;\n\u2022the size and timing of orders from independent distributors or customers;\n\u2022the attraction and retention of key personnel, particularly in sales and marketing, regulatory, manufacturing and research and development;\n\u2022unanticipated delays or an inability to control costs;\n\u2022general economic conditions as well as those specific to our customers and markets; and\n\u2022seasonal fluctuations in revenue due to the elective nature of some procedures.\nOur stock price may be volatile, which may cause the value of our stock to decline or subject us to a securities class action litigation.\nThe trading price of our common stock price may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022general economic, industry and market conditions;\n\u2022actions by institutional or other large stockholders;\n\u2022the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;\n\u2022volume and timing of orders for our products;\n\u2022developments generally affecting medical device companies;\n\u2022the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022investor perceptions of us and our business, including changes in market valuations of medical device companies; and\n\u2022our results of operations and financial performance.\nIn connection with the recent stock market decline that began in March 2020, the closing market price of our common stock has declined significantly. In recent years, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price for many companies in industries similar to ours. Some of these fluctuations have been unrelated to operating performance and are attributable, in part, to outside factors such as the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and its potential impact on the world economy.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the NASDAQ Stock Market and the market for medical devices in particular, have experienced substantial price and volume volatility that is often seemingly unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company after a period of volatility in the market price of its common stock. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Any securities litigation claims brought against us could result in substantial expense and the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our business.", "PERMNO": 90179, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "ANGO"}
