RISK FACTORS\nAlthough not required to disclose risk factors, Biomerica has chosen to inform users of its financial information about certain risks associated with the Company\u2019s operations below.\nDistribution - Biomerica has entered into various exclusive and non-exclusive distribution agreements (the \"Agreements\") which generally specify territories of distribution. The Agreements range in term from one to five years. Biomerica may be dependent upon such distributors for the marketing and selling of its products worldwide during the terms of these agreements. Such distributors are generally obligated to sell specified minimum quantities of the Company's products to keep the exclusive, while non-exclusive distributors have no minimum purchase requirements. There can be no assurance of the volume of product sales that may be achieved by such distributors. The Company has several large distributors which account for a significant portion of its business. The Company terminated the agreement with one such distributor in fiscal 2013 due to certain proprietary disagreements however the Company replaced this last distributor with a new distributor. The loss of one of these distributors could adversely affect the Company's financial results.\nGovernment Regulation - Biomerica's immunodiagnostic products are regulated in the United States as medical devices primarily by the FDA and as such, require regulatory clearance or approval prior to commercialization in the United States. Pursuant to the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, the FDA regulates, among other things, the clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, distribution, sale and use of medical devices in the United States. Failure of Biomerica to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, the government's refusal to grant pre-market clearance or pre-market approval of devices, withdrawal of marketing approvals, and criminal prosecution. In addition, there is the possibility that new health care reform laws may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s sales.\nSales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. The time required to obtain registrations or approvals required by foreign countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and requirements for licensing may differ significantly from FDA requirements. There can be no assurance that Biomerica will be able to obtain regulatory clearances for its current or any future products in the United States or in foreign markets.\nEuropean Community - Biomerica is required to obtain certification in the European community to sell products in those countries. The certification requires Biomerica to maintain certain quality standards. Biomerica has been granted certification and undergoes annual audits to assure that the Company remains in compliance with regulations. There is no assurance that Biomerica will be able to retain its certification in the future. The loss of business or the ability to conduct business in Europe could materially adversely affect the results of the Company.\nRisk of Product Liability - Testing, manufacturing and marketing of Biomerica's products entails risk of product liability. In addition, the Company may have unknown intellectual property risks associated with patent or trademark infringement of other companies as well as having other companies infringe on our intellectual property . Biomerica currently has product liability insurance. There can be no assurance, however, that Biomerica will be able to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect Biomerica against losses due to product liability. An inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of Biomerica's products. In addition, a product liability claim or recall could have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the Company.\nHazardous Materials - Biomerica's manufacturing and research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. Although Biomerica believes that safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and Federal regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of such an accident, the Company could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability could exceed the resources of the Company. The Company may incur substantial costs to comply with environmental regulations.\nCommon stock performance - The common stock of the Company is subject to fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors including, but not limited to, financial results, general economic conditions, fluctuations in sales volumes and expenses, competition, and our failure to generate new products. The loss of one or more employees in senior management could adversely impact the Company\u2019s stock value.\nRaw Materials - The Company utilizes certain raw materials that are critical to its manufacturing processes and relies on a limited number of manufacturers of such materials. Should any of these materials become unavailable or extremely cost prohibitive the sales of the Company could be adversely affected.\nAbility to Obtain Financing - Although the Company has been able to obtain financing in the past, there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to obtain financing that may be needed in the future.\nLimited Trading - The Company is traded on the Over-the-Counter stock market. Trading on this exchange is limited and liquidation of the Company\u2019s stock may be difficult as there is a limited market for the Company\u2019s stock.", "PERMNO": 55862, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "BMRA"}
