{"cik": "1000298", "company": "IMPAC MORTGAGE HOLDINGS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-11", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur long-term success is primarily dependent on our ability to increase the profitability of our mortgage originations.\nWe believe that a key driver for our Company will be increasing the profitability of our mortgage lending operations. Our success is dependent on many factors such as the documentation and data capture technology we employ, increasing our loan origination operational capacities, increasing our mortgage origination efficiencies, attracting qualified employees, ability to maintain our approvals and sell or securitize loans eligible for sale to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and other investors, ability to increase our mortgage servicing portfolio, the ability to obtain adequate warehouse borrowing capacity, the ability to adequately maintain loan quality and manage the risk of losses from loan repurchases, the changing regulatory environment for mortgage lending and the ability to fund our originations.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient net earnings from our mortgage lending operations, we may be unable to satisfy our future operating costs and liabilities, including repayment of our debt obligations, which may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to satisfy our debt obligations or to meet or maintain the requisite financial covenant requirements with our lenders, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely effected.\nWe have significant debt obligations including:\n\u25cf $20.0 million Convertible Promissory Notes due May 2022;\n\u25cf Junior Subordinated Notes with an outstanding principal balance of $62.0 million at December 31, 2021 and due March 2034; and\n\u25cf Warehouse facilities with third-party lenders which are secured by and used to fund residential mortgage loans until such loans are sold.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt. If we are unable to generate cash flow from operations, we may be required to pursue one or more alternatives, including, but not limited to, monetizing certain assets (including but not limited to our residual interests), restructuring debt and/or pursuing actions to reorganize the capital structure or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be unfavorable to us or, highly dilutive to our shareholders and other stakeholders. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, if we are unable to sell loans timely to repay our warehouse lenders, our liquidity may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our credit and warehouse facilities contain covenants, including requirements to maintain a certain minimum net worth, liquidity, litigation judgment thresholds, debt ratios, profitability levels and other customary debt covenants. A breach of the covenants can result in an event of default under our facilities and as such allows the lender to pursue certain remedies, including foreclosure on our assets. Furthermore, a breach under one facility may constitute a cross default under other agreements which would allow counterparties to pursue additional remedies against us. At December 31, 2021, we were not in compliance with certain financial covenants under our warehouse facilities and received the necessary waivers. In the event we are in noncompliance with our debt obligations, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain waivers in the event of future noncompliance of our debt obligations.\nFurther spread of COVID-19 or any mutations thereof could negatively impact the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business.\nThe continued effects of the pandemic could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations due to interrupted service and availability of personnel, including our executive officers and other employees that are part of our management team and an inability to recruit, attract and retain skilled personnel. To the extent our management or personnel are impacted in significant numbers by the outbreak of pandemic or epidemic disease and are not available or allowed to conduct work, our business and operating results may be negatively impacted. Additionally, the pandemic could negatively impact our ability to ensure operational continuity in the event our business continuity plan is not effective or ineffectively implemented or deployed during a disruption.\nThe continued impact of the pandemic could negatively impact the availability of key third party service providers necessary to conduct our business and the ability of counterparties to meet contractual obligations to us.\nOur financial results and results of operations could be negatively impacted by the inability of third-party vendors to provide services we rely on to conduct our business and operate effectively, including vendors that provide IT services, mortgage origination support services, corporate support services, government services or other operational support services. Further, an inability of our counterparties to make or satisfy the conditions or representations and warranties in agreements they have entered into with us could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur use of financial leverage exposes us to increased risks, including breaches and additional potential breaches of the financial covenants under our borrowing facilities, which could result in our being required to immediately repay all outstanding amounts borrowed under these facilities and these facilities being unavailable to use for future financing needs, as well as triggering cross-defaults under other debt agreements.\nSignificant and widespread decreases in the fair values of our assets have caused and could continue to cause us\nto breach financial covenants under our borrowing facilities related to profitability, net worth and leverage. Such covenants, if breached, can result in our being required to immediately repay all outstanding amounts borrowed under these facilities and these facilities being unavailable to use for future financing needs, as well as triggering cross-defaults under other debt agreements. During the second and fourth quarters of 2021, we breached such financial covenants in certain borrowing agreements with our financing counterparties and were able to obtain waivers. We regularly engage in discussions with our financing counterparties in regards to such financial covenants; however, we cannot be certain whether we will be able to remain in compliance with these financial covenants, or whether our financing counterparties will negotiate terms or amendments in respect of these financial covenants, the timing of any such negotiations or amendments or the terms thereof. Even if we continue to obtain temporary or permanent amendments or waivers from financing counterparties to amend and or waive financial covenants, there is no certainty that we will be able to remain in compliance with such amended covenants and or receive waivers in the event we breach a covenant. If any of our counterparties elected not to renew our borrowing facility, we may not be able to find a replacement counterparty, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe use of alternative exit strategies subjects us to risk associated with the potential limitation or elimination of delivery options to counterparties which has had and could continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIt is important for us to sell or securitize the loans we originate. Prepayment speeds on loans generated through our retail direct channel have been a concern for some investors dating back to 2016, which has resulted and could further result in adverse pricing or delays in our ability to sell or securitize loans and related MSRs on a timely and profitable basis. The use of alternative exit strategies has resulted in and could further result in adverse pricing, delays in our ability to sell timely as a result of due diligence, investor overlays, and increased staffing. In addition, reliance on these investors subjects us to changes in risk, collateral, and counterparty eligibility requirements which may affect our ability to deliver and securitize loans. If we are unable to meet all required eligibility criteria, which may be amended and/or implemented without notice, it could impact the volume, products, pricing, and servicing options for originated loans which could have a material adverse impact on overall operations, profitability and cash flows. Additionally, there can be no assurance that investors will continue to purchase our collateral at favorable terms, or at all.\nThe success and growth of our business will depend upon our ability to adapt to and implement technological changes.\nWe operate in an industry experiencing rapid technological change and frequent product introductions. We rely on our technology to make our platform available to clients, evaluate loan applicants and service loans. In addition, we may increasingly rely on technological innovation as we introduce new products, expand our current products into new markets and continue to streamline various loan-related and lending processes. The process of integrating new technologies and products is complex, and if we are unable to successfully innovate and continue to deliver a superior client experience, the demand for our products and services may decrease and our growth and operations may be harmed.\nThe origination process is increasingly dependent on technology, and our business relies on our continued ability to process loan applications over the internet, accept electronic signatures, and provide instant process status updates and other client- and loan applicant-expected conveniences. Maintaining and improving this technology will require significant capital expenditures.\nThe implementation of new technologies, including migrating to new technology solutions such as loan origination systems (LOS) or point of sale systems (POS) requires significant financial and personnel resources. To the extent we are dependent on any particular technology or technological solution, we may be harmed if such technology or technological solution becomes non-compliant with existing industry standards, fails to meet or exceed the capabilities of our competitors' equivalent technologies or technological solutions, becomes increasingly expensive to service, retain and update or malfunctions or functions in a way we did not anticipate that results in loan defects potentially requiring repurchase. Additionally, new technologies and technological solutions are continually being released. As such, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in improving our technologies' functionality.\nTo operate our LOS, POS and websites and provide our loan products and services, we use software packages from a variety of third parties, which are customized and integrated with code that we have developed ourselves. We rely on third-party software products and services related to automated underwriting functions and loan document production.\nIf we are unable to integrate this software in a fully functional manner, we may experience increased costs and difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction or marketing of new products and services.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to successfully adopt new technology as critical systems and applications become obsolete and better ones become available. Additionally, if we fail to implement and maintain technologies to respond to technological developments and changing client and loan applicant needs in a cost-effective manner, or fail to acquire or integrate our third-party technologies effectively, we may experience disruptions in our operations, lose market share or incur substantial costs.\nOur performance may be adversely affected by the performance of parties who service or sub-service our mortgage loans.\nWe contract with third parties for the servicing of our mortgage loans in our long-term mortgage portfolio, for which we are the master servicer, and the servicing portfolio in our mortgage lending operations. Although we use third-party servicers, we retain primary responsibility to ensure the serviced loans meet contractual and regulatory requirements. Our operations, performance and liabilities are subject to risks associated with inadequate or untimely servicing. If a servicer defaults or fails to perform to certain standards then this can be deemed to be a default or failure by us to perform those duties or functions. If we, or our sub-servicers, commit a material breach of our obligations as a servicer or master servicer, we may be subject to damages or termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period of time following notice, causing us to lose servicing rights income. In addition, we may be required to indemnify the investor or securitization trustee against losses from any failure by us, as master servicer or on behalf of the sub-servicer, to perform the servicing obligations properly. If, as a result of a servicer or sub-servicer\u2019s failure to perform adequately, we were terminated as servicer by an investor, trustee or master servicer, the value of any servicing or master servicing rights held by us could be adversely affected. Also, this could affect the cash flow generated by our servicing rights portfolio.\nPoor performance by a sub-servicer may result in greater than expected delinquencies and foreclosures and losses on our mortgage loans or, in the case of our long-term mortgage portfolio, in our resulting exposure to investors, bond holders, bond insurers or others to whom we are responsible for the performance of our loan sub-servicers. As master servicer in our securitizations we are responsible for the duties, responsibilities and actions of the subservicers. Their actions, or lack thereof, may impose liability upon us from third party claims. A substantial increase in our delinquency or foreclosure rate could adversely affect our ability to access the capital and secondary markets for our financing needs. With respect to our long-term mortgage portfolio, greater delinquencies would adversely affect our cash flows and the value of our residual interests, if any, we hold in connection with that securitization.\nThe value of mortgage servicing rights are dependent upon various factors, including, but not limited to, the adequate performance of the servicing function by our sub-servicer, the responsibilities imposed on us by the investors of our loans for which we hold the servicing rights, interest rates, the cost of our sub-servicers, loan prepayments and delinquencies. As these factors and others vary, the value of our mortgage servicing rights may fluctuate which may affect our ability to meet financial covenants, maintain credit facilities, expand our operations and generate income from our operations.\nOur NonQM product offerings may expose us to a higher risk of delinquencies, regulatory risks, foreclosures, counterparty risk and losses adversely affecting our earnings and financial condition.\nWe originate and acquire various types of residential mortgage products, which include NonQM and non-conforming loan products. Unlike Qualified Mortgages, NonQM loans do not benefit from a presumption that the borrower has the ability to repay the loan. In the event that these NonQM mortgages begin to experience a significant rate of default, we could be subject to statutory claims for violations of the ability to repay standard. Any such claims could materially and adversely affect our ability to underwrite these loans, our business, and results of operations or financial condition.\nWhile we undertake initiatives to mitigate any exposure and use our commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that we have made a reasonable determination that the borrowers will have the ability to repay a loan, this type of product has increased risk and exposure to litigation and claims of borrowers. If, however, we were to make a loan which does not satisfy the regulatory standards for ascertaining the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan, the consequences could include giving the borrower a defense to repayment of the loan, which may prevent us from collecting interest and principal on that loan.\nNonQM loans are mortgages that generally did not qualify for purchase by government-sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Credit risks associated with all these mortgages may be greater than those associated with conforming mortgages. Mortgages made to these borrowers may entail a higher risk of delinquency and higher losses than mortgages made to borrowers who utilize conventional mortgage sources. Delinquency, foreclosures and losses generally increase during economic slowdowns or recessions. The actual risk of delinquencies, foreclosures and losses on mortgages made to these borrowers may be higher to the extent the economy enters a recession. The combination of different underwriting criteria and higher rates of interest can adversely affect our business and financial condition from higher prepayment rates and higher delinquency rates and/or credit losses. Additionally, during periods of market dislocation, similar to what occurred during the first and second quarters of 2020, liquidity for NonQM and non-conforming loan products suffer more acute pressure which creates a substantial widening of credit spreads on these assets, causing a severe decline in the values assigned by investors and counterparties for NonQM and non-conforming assets. These periods of market dislocation have adversely affected the values assigned to our NonQM and non-conforming assets. Further periods of economic dislocation caused by the pandemic or other factors may adversely affect the liquidity for our products and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCybersecurity risks, data privacy breaches, cyber incidents and technology failures may adversely affect our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information, and/or damage to our business relationships, all of which could negatively impact our financial results.\nA cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our information resources. These incidents may be an intentional attack or an unintentional event and could involve gaining unauthorized access to our information systems for purposes of theft of certain personally identifiable information of consumers, misappropriating assets, stealing confidential information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. The result of these incidents may include disrupted operations, misstated or unreliable financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs, litigation and damage to our business relationships.\nAs our reliance on rapidly changing technology has increased, so have the risks posed to its information systems, both proprietary and those provided to us by third-party service providers. System disruptions and failures caused by fire, power loss, telecommunications outages, unauthorized intrusion, unintended employee actions, computer viruses and disabling devices, natural disasters and other similar events may interrupt or delay our ability to provide services to our customers or result in the unintended disclosure of consumer information.\nDespite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, our investment in significant physical and technological security measures, employee training, contractual precautions and business continuity plans, and our implementation of policies and procedures designed to help mitigate cybersecurity risks and cyber intrusions, there can be no assurance that any such cyber intrusions or data privacy breaches will not occur or, if they do occur, that they will be adequately addressed. We also may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches, especially because the methods of attack change frequently or may not be recognized until after such attack has been launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including third parties such as persons involved with organized crime or associated with external service providers. We are also held accountable for the actions and inactions of our third-party vendors regarding cybersecurity, data privacy breaches and other consumer-related matters.\nAny of the foregoing events could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, additional regulatory scrutiny, governmental enforcement actions, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nInability to successfully complete securitizations, or delayed mortgage loan sales or securitization closings, could result in a liquidity shortage which would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are exploring utilizing securitizations as an additional exit strategy to generate cash proceeds to repay borrowings and replenish our borrowing capacity. If there is a delay in mortgage loan sales or securitization closing or any reduction in our ability to complete mortgage loan sales or securitizations, we may be required to utilize other sources of financing, which, may not be available on favorable terms or at all. In addition, delays in closing mortgage sales or securitizations of our mortgages exposes us to additional credit and interest rate risk up to the closing of the transaction. Several factors could affect our ability to complete securitizations of our mortgages or mortgage loan sales, including:\n\u25cf conditions in the securities and secondary markets;\n\u25cf credit quality of the mortgages acquired or originated through our mortgage operations;\n\u25cf volume of our mortgage loan acquisitions and originations;\n\u25cf operational inefficiencies causing delay in settlement;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain credit enhancements; and\n\u25cf lack of investors purchasing higher risk components of the securities.\nIf we are unable to sell a sufficient number of mortgages at a premium or profitably securitize a significant number of our mortgages in a particular financial reporting period, of if we experience a delay in mortgage loan sales or securities closings, then we could experience a liquidity shortage leading to lower net earnings or a loss for that period. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to profitably securitize or sell our loans on a whole loan basis, or at all.\nWe may not be able to access financing sources on favorable terms, or at all, which could adversely affect our ability to implement and operate our business as planned.\nFuture financing sources may include borrowings in the form of credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities, structured financing arrangements, public and private equity and debt issuances and derivative instruments, in addition to transactions or asset specific funding arrangements. Our access to sources of financing depends upon a number of factors some of which we have little or no control over, including general market conditions, resources and policies or lenders. In addition, if regulatory capital requirements imposed on our private lenders change, they may be required to limit, or increase the cost of, financing they provide to us. This could potentially increase our financing costs and reduce our liquidity as well as limit our ability to expand our mortgage operations. Depending on market conditions at the relevant time, we may have to rely more heavily on additional equity issuances, which may be dilutive to our shareholders, or on less efficient forms of debt financing that require a larger portion of our cash flow from operations, thereby reducing funds available for our operations and future business opportunities. We cannot assure you that we will have access to such equity or debt capital on favorable terms (including, without limitation, cost and term) at the desired times, or at all, which could negatively affect our results of operations. If our access to such funds are restricted or are on terms that are materially changed, we may not be able to continue those operations which may affect our income and loan origination volumes.\nLoss of our current executive officers or other key management could significantly harm our business.\nWe depend on the diligence, skill and experience of our senior executives. We believe that our future results will also depend in part upon our attracting and retaining highly skilled and qualified management. We seek to compensate our executive officers, as well as other employees, through competitive salaries, bonuses and other incentive plans, but there can be no assurance that these programs will allow us to retain key management executives or hire new key employees. The loss of our senior executive officers and key management could have a material adverse effect on our operations because other officers may not have the experience and expertise to readily replace these individuals. Competition for such personnel is intense, and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel. The loss of, and changes in, key personnel and their responsibilities may be disruptive to our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become, and in some cases are, a defendant in lawsuits, some of which may be class action matters, and we may not prevail in these matters.\nIndividual and class action lawsuits and regulatory actions alleging improper marketing practices, abusive loan terms and fees, disclosure violations and other matters are risks faced by all mortgage originators. We are a defendant in purported class actions pending in different states and could be named in other matters. We will incur defense costs and other expenses in connection with the lawsuits, and we cannot assure you that the ultimate outcome of these or other actions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition to the expense and burden incurred in defending any of these actions and any damages that we may suffer, our management\u2019s efforts and attention may be diverted from the ordinary business operations in order to address these claims. Plus, we may be deemed in default of our warehouse lines if a judgment for money that exceeds specified thresholds is rendered against us. If the final resolution is unfavorable to us in any of these actions, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows might be materially adversely affected. For additional information regarding ongoing litigation, refer to Note 13. \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nOur hedging strategies implemented by our mortgage lending operations may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with the market movement of interest rates.\nWe use various derivative financial instruments to provide a level of protection against interest rate risks in our mortgage lending operations, but no hedging strategy can protect us completely. When interest rates change, we expect to record a gain or loss on derivatives which would be offset by an inverse change in the value of mortgage loans held-for-sale, our held mortgage servicing rights, forward sale and interest rate lock commitments. We cannot assure you, however, that our use of derivatives will offset the risks related to changes in interest rates. There have been periods, and it is likely that there will be periods in the future, during which we will not have offsetting gains or losses in mortgage loans, forward sale and interest rate lock commitment values after accounting for our derivative financial instruments. The derivative financial instruments we select may not have the effect of reducing our interest rate risk. In addition, the nature and timing of hedging transactions may influence the effectiveness of these strategies. Poorly designed strategies, improperly executed and recorded transactions or inaccurate assumptions could actually increase our risk and losses. In addition, hedging strategies involve transaction and other costs. We cannot assure you that our hedging strategy and the derivatives that we use will adequately offset the risk of interest rate volatility or that our hedging transactions will not result in losses.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating losses and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAt the end of our 2021 taxable year, we had estimated federal and California net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $623.5 million and $435.2 million, respectively. Federal NOLs begin to expire in 2027 and California NOLs begin to expire in 2028. We may not generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to be able to realize fully the tax benefits of our NOL carryforwards. Although, under existing tax rules, we are generally allowed to use those NOL carryforwards to offset taxable income in subsequent taxable years, our ability to use those NOL carryforwards to offset income may be severely limited to the extent that we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. These provisions could also limit our ability to deduct certain losses (built-in losses) we recognize after an ownership change with respect to assets we own at the time of the ownership change. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382, results from transactions increasing ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in our stock by more than 50% over a three-year period. In addition, the generation of taxable income from cancellation of debt may further reduce the NOL. Any limitation on our NOL carryforwards that could be used to offset taxable income would adversely affect our liquidity and cash flow, as and when we become profitable. On October 23, 2019, our Board enacted the Tax Benefit Preservation Rights Agreement (NOL rights plan), which was approved at the Company\u2019s 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, is designed to mitigate the risk of losing net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes from being limited in reducing future income taxes. Although our NOL rights plan is intended to prevent an ownership change, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience an ownership change or that we will otherwise be able to use, in full or in part, our NOLs.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information provided by customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished to us by, or on behalf of, customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. In deciding whether to extend credit, we may rely upon our customers' representations that their financial statements are accurate. We also may rely on customer representations and certifications, or other audit or accountants' reports, with respect to the business and financial condition of our commercial clients. Our financial condition, results of operations, financial reporting and reputation could be materially adversely affected if we rely on materially misleading, false, inaccurate or fraudulent information.\nRepresentations and warranties made by us in our loan sales, servicing rights sales and securitizations may subject us to liability.\nIn connection with our loan and/or servicing rights sales to third parties and our prior securitizations, we transferred mortgages and/or servicing rights to third parties or, to a lesser extent, into a trust in exchange for cash and, in the case of a securitized mortgage, residual certificates issued by the trust. The trustee, purchaser, bondholder, guarantor or other entities involved in the sales or issuance of the securities (which may include bond insurers) may have recourse to us with respect to the breach of the representations and warranties made by us at the time such mortgages and/or servicing rights are transferred or when the securities are sold. We attempt to mitigate the potential recourse from such purchasers by seeking remedies from correspondent sellers and wholesale brokers who originated the mortgages if we did not originate\nthe loan. However, many of the entities we acquired loans from in the past are no longer in business or may not be able to financially cover the losses. Furthermore, if we discover, prior to the sale or transfer of a loan, that there is any fraud or misrepresentation with respect to the mortgage and the originator fails to repurchase the mortgage, then we may not be able to sell the mortgage or we may have to sell the mortgage at a discount. Changes in the timing, processes and procedures of our primary investors\u2019 review of loans which they purchase from us may affect the number of loans that are rejected, the timing of our loan sales, or the frequency of repurchase demands issued to us. Also, similar changes by mortgage insurers who agree to insure loans may also affect the frequency and timing of our loan sales. As a result, the effectiveness of our loan sales, our repurchase reserves and our profitability may be adversely affected.\nThe geographic concentration of our mortgages increases our exposure to risks in those areas.\nWe do not set limitations on the percentage of mortgages composed of properties located in any one area (whether by state, zip code or other geographic measure). Concentration in any one area increases our exposure to the economic and natural hazard risks associated with that area. A majority of our mortgage acquisitions and originations and mortgages held in our long-term mortgage portfolio are secured by properties in California (approximately 77% of our mortgage originations were generated from California in 2021) and, to a lesser extent, Arizona, Florida and Nevada. These states have previously experienced, and may experience in the future, economic downturns and California and Florida have also suffered the effects of certain natural hazards. During past economic downturns, real estate values in California and Florida have decreased drastically, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, Florida is among several states with higher than average costs for investors in circumstances of mortgage default and foreclosure, since the foreclosure process takes significantly longer than average. Accordingly, to the extent the mortgages we originate or are held in our long-term mortgage portfolio experience defaults or foreclosures in that area, we may be exposed to higher losses.\nFurthermore, if borrowers are not insured for natural disasters, which are typically not covered by standard hazard insurance policies, then they may not be able to repair the property or may stop paying their mortgages if the property is damaged. This would cause increased foreclosures and decrease our ability to recover losses on properties affected by such disasters. This would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur vendor relationships subject us to a variety of risks.\nWe have significant vendors that, among other things, provide us with financial, technology and other services to support our mortgage loan servicing and origination businesses. Some of these outsourced services, such as technology, could have a material effect on our business and operations if our third party provider was unable to, or failed to, properly provide such services. With respect to vendors engaged to perform activities required by servicing criteria, we have elected to take responsibility for assessing compliance with the applicable servicing criteria for the applicable vendor and are required to have procedures in place to provide reasonable assurance that the vendor\u2019s activities comply in all material respects with servicing criteria applicable to the vendor, including but not limited to, monitoring compliance with our predetermined policies and procedures and monitoring the status of payment processing operations. In the event that a vendor\u2019s activities do not comply with the servicing criteria, it could negatively impact our servicing agreements. In addition, if our current vendors were to stop providing services to us on acceptable terms, including as a result of one or more vendor bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other vendors in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, we may incur significant costs to resolve any such disruptions in service and this could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, the CFPB has stated that supervised banks and non-banks could be held liable for actions of their service providers. As a result, we could be exposed to liability, CFPB enforcement actions or other administrative penalties if the vendors with whom we do business violate consumer protection laws.\nIf we are forced to liquidate, we may have few unpledged assets for distribution to unsecured creditors or equity holders.\nIn the event we were forced to liquidate and distribute our assets, our common stockholders would share in our assets only after we satisfy any amounts we owe to our creditors and preferred equity holders. Similarly, our preferred equity holders would share in our assets only after we satisfy any amounts owed to our creditors. The majority of our assets are either collateral for specific borrowings or pledged as collateral for secured liabilities. Additionally, there is volatility and significant judgement with respect to the valuation of a significant portion our assets and liabilities. If our liquidation or dissolution were attributable to our inability to profitably operate our business, then it is likely that we would have material liabilities at the time of liquidation or dissolution. Accordingly, we cannot provide any assurance that\nsufficient assets will remain available after the payment of our creditors to enable preferred equity holders and/or common stock holders to receive any liquidation distribution with respect to any preferred equity or common stock, as applicable.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may not be effective.\nOur risk management framework seeks to mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return. We have established policies and procedures intended to identify, monitor and manage the types of risk to which we are subject, including credit risk, market and interest rate risk, liquidity risk, cyber risk, regulatory, legal and reputational risk. Although we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies and procedures and expect to continue to do so in the future, these policies and procedures, as well as our risk management techniques such as our hedging strategies, may not be fully effective. There may also be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated. As regulations and markets in which we operate continue to evolve, our risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those changes. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify or mitigate our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain effective systems of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately or prevent fraud, which could cause current and potential stockholders to lose confidence in our financial reporting, adversely affect the trading price of our securities or harm our operating results.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. We cannot be certain that our efforts to improve or maintain our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures will be successful or that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or difficulties encountered in their implementation or other effective improvement of our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could harm our operating results, or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In the past, we have reported, and may discover in the future, material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nIneffective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities or affect our ability to access the capital markets and could result in regulatory proceedings against us by, among others, the SEC. In addition, a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting, which may lead to deficiencies in the preparation of financial statements, could lead to litigation claims against us. The defense of any such claims may cause the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, and we may be required to pay damages if any such claims or proceedings are not resolved in our favor. Any litigation, even if resolved in our favor, could cause us to incur significant legal and other expenses or cause delays in our public reporting. Such events could harm our business, affect our ability to raise capital and adversely affect the trading price of our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur earnings may decrease, or losses increase, because of changes in prevailing interest rates.\nOur profitability is directly affected by changes in prevailing interest rates over which we have no control. The following are certain material risks we face related to changes in interest rates:\nOriginations:\n\u25cf an increase in interest rates could adversely affect our loan originations volume because refinancing an existing loan would be less attractive for homeowners and qualifying for a purchase money loan may be more difficult for consumers;\n\u25cf an increase in interest rates could also adversely affect our production margins due to increased competition among originators;\nServicing:\n\u25cf a decrease in interest rates may increase prepayment speeds which may lead to (i) increased MSR amortization; (ii) decrease in servicing fees; and (iii) decrease in the value of our MSRs;\nDebt:\n\u25cf an increase in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our outstanding debt or the costs associated with financing new debt, including our ability to finance loan originations.\nAny of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nThe pandemic has impaired and may continue to impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or other obligations, resulting in increases in forbearances and/or delinquencies, which could negatively impact our business.\nBorrowers that have been negatively impacted by the pandemic may not remit payments of principal and interest relating to their mortgage loans on a timely basis, or at all. This could be due to an inability to make such payments, an unwillingness to make such payments, or a temporary or permanent waiver of the requirement to make such payments, including under the terms of any applicable forbearance, modification, or maturity extension agreement or program. On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted to provide financial assistance to individuals and businesses affected by the pandemic. The CARES Act provides certain measures to support individuals in maintaining solvency through monetary relief, including in the form of loan forgiveness/forbearance. The CARES Act, among other things, provides any homeowner with a federally-backed mortgage who is experiencing financial hardship the option of up to six months of forbearance on their mortgage payments, with a potential to extend that forbearance for another six months. During the forbearance period, no additional fees, penalties or interest can accrue on the homeowner\u2019s account. The CARES Act also established a temporary moratorium on foreclosures. Transactions we enter into to finance loans with warehouse counterparties and to sell whole loans to third parties, may be negatively impacted by the pandemic related payment forbearances, waiver, or other payment deferral program, including but not limited to, reducing proceeds from these transactions, require us to repurchase impacted loans and reduce proceeds or incur losses on loans sold that are within forbearance or other deferred payment programs. To the extent borrower forbearance affects our ability to finance and sell loans to third parties, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA decline in real estate values may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nIf there is a decline in real estate values, borrowers may default on our residential loans. A reduction in real estate values reduces a borrower\u2019s equity in their home which generally increases the underlying loan to value ratio and leads to a corresponding risk of default. If a borrower defaults and we have sold the loan or the servicing of the loan, we may violate our representations and warranties from the sale and be obligated to repurchase the loan.\nOur business is affected by changes in the state of the general economy and the financial markets, and a slowdown or downturn in the general economy or the financial markets could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur customer activity is intrinsically linked to the health of the economy generally and of the financial markets specifically. In addition to the economic factors, a downturn in the real estate or commercial markets generally could cause our customers and potential customers to exit the market for loans. As a result, we believe that fluctuations, disruptions, instability or downturns in the general economy and the financial markets could disproportionately affect demand for our lending products. In addition, the spread of the Covid-19 virus has caused economic disruption worldwide, the effect of which may be over an extended period of time and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. If such conditions occur and persist, our business and financial results, including our liquidity and our ability to fulfill our debt obligations, could be materially adversely affected.\nReplacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), a regulator of financial services firms in the United Kingdom, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rates after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), a group of private-market participants convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to help ensure a successful transition\nfrom U.S. dollar LIBOR (USD-LIBOR) to a more robust reference rate, proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) represents the best alternative to USD-LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a transition plan with specific steps and timelines designed to encourage the adoption of SOFR and guide the transition to SOFR from USD-LIBOR. The Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom and other regulatory bodies have issued statements encouraging cessation of new transactions referencing USD LIBOR after December 31, 2021, while supporting extension of the publication of major USD-LIBOR tenors to mid-2023, to allow additional legacy contracts to mature on their existing terms. Announcements by government-sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, suggest that the SOFR will become the LIBOR replacement for the industry.\nWhile regulators and market participants continue to promote the creation and functioning of post-LIBOR indices (SOFR in particular), the impact of the discontinuance and replacement of LIBOR is uncertain. It is not currently possible to know with certainty what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views and alternatives may have on the financial markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments for the periods preceding and following LIBOR's cessation. Differences in contractual provisions of certain legacy assets and liabilities and other factors may cause the consequences of the discontinuance of LIBOR to vary by instrument. While enacted and pending legislation is intended to address issues with respect to legacy LIBOR-linked assets and liabilities, it is unclear whether they will completely address the issues associated with legacy transactions. We are evaluating the potential impact of the possible SOFR replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, but are not able to predict what the impact of such a transition will have on our business, financial condition, or results of operations at this time. The market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular any such transition could:\n\u25cf adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, the revenue and expenses associate with, and the value of our floating-rate obligations, loans, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally;\n\u25cf legal and execution risks, relating to documentation changes for the transition of legacy contracts to alternate benchmark rates; and/or\n\u25cf require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark.\nWhile cessation timelines have been agreed by the industry and regulatory authorities, we continue to assess how the discontinuation of existing benchmark rates could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation in the mortgage industry related to securitizations against issuers, sellers, servicers, originators, underwriters and others may adversely affect our business operations.\nAs defaults, delinquencies, foreclosures, and losses in the real estate market occur, there have been lawsuits by various investors, insurers, underwriters and others against various participants in securitizations, such as sponsors, depositors, underwriters, servicers and loan sellers. Some lawsuits have alleged that the mortgage loans had origination defects, that there were misrepresentations made about the mortgage loans and that the parties failed to properly disclose the quality of the mortgage loans or repurchase defective loans wherein servicing standards were not maintained or that there were other misrepresentations or false representations. Historically, we both securitized and sold mortgage loans to third parties that may have been deposited or included in pools for securitizations. As a result, we may incur significant legal and other expenses in defending against claims and litigation and we may be required to pay settlement costs, damages, penalties or other charges which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Regulation\nLoss or suspension of our approvals, or limitations placed on our delivery volume, or the potential limitation or wind-down of, the role Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae play in the residential mortgage-backed security (MBS) market have had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nWe originate loans which are intended to be eligible for sale to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, (together, the GSEs), government insured or guaranteed loans, such as FHA, VA and USDA loans, and loans eligible for Ginnie Mae securities issuance (collectively, the Agencies), in addition to other investors and counterparties (collectively, the Counterparties). We also have serviced loans sold to the GSEs, as well as securitized with the Agencies and other Counterparties. The role of the GSEs, Agencies, and Counterparties may become limited over time in their ability to guarantee mortgages or purchase mortgage loans. Conversely, the GSEs, Agencies, and Counterparties may propose to implement reforms relating to borrowers, lenders, and investors in the mortgage market, including reducing the maximum size of a purchasable loan, phasing-in a minimum down payment requirement for borrowers, changing underwriting standards, and increasing accountability and transparency in the securitization process. The GSEs, Agencies, and Counterparties may also limit the amount of loans a company can sell to them based upon the company\u2019s net worth or the performance of loans sold to them. These limitations and reforms could negatively impact our financial condition, net earnings and growth.\nWe have historically serviced loans on behalf of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as loans that have been delivered into securitization programs sponsored by Ginnie Mae and other Counterparties in connection with the issuance of agency guaranteed mortgage-backed securities and other non-agency securitizations. These entities establish the base service fee to compensate us for servicing loans as well as the assessment of fines and penalties that may be imposed upon us for failing to meet servicing standards.\nThe extent and timing of any regulatory reform regarding the GSEs, Agencies, Counterparties and the home mortgage market, as well as any effect on the Company\u2019s business operations and financial results, are uncertain. It is important for us to sell or securitize the loans we originate and, when doing so, maintain the option to also sell the related MSR's associated with these loans. Prepayment speeds on loans generated through our retail direct channel have been a concern for some investors dating back to 2016, which has resulted and could further result in adverse pricing or delays in our ability to sell or securitize loans and related MSRs on a timely and profitable basis. During the fourth quarter of 2017, Fannie Mae sufficiently limited the manner and volume for our deliveries of eligible loans such that we elected to cease deliveries to them and we expanded our whole loan investor base for these loans. In 2019, with the creation of the uniform mortgage-backed securities (UMBS) market, which was intended to improve liquidity and align prepayment speeds across Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities, Freddie Mac raised concerns about the high prepayment speeds of our loans generated through our retail direct channel. We have continued to expand our investor base and complete servicing released loan sales to non-GSE whole loan investors and expect to continue to utilize these alternative exit strategies for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac eligible loans. In July 2020, we received notification from Freddie Mac that our eligibility to sell whole loans to Freddie Mac was suspended, without cause. While we believe that the overall volume delivered under purchase commitments to the GSEs was immaterial prior to the notification, we are committed to operating actively and in good standing with our broad range of capital markets counterparties. We continue to take steps to manage our prepayment speeds to be more consistent with our industry comparables and to reestablish the full confidence and delivery mechanisms to our investor base, but we cannot provide any assurance that our eligibility to sell whole loans to Freddie Mac will be restored.\nSubstantive changes to risk-based and collateral eligibility requirements by any of the GSEs, Agencies or Counterparties may affect our ability to originate, deliver or securitize loans. These changes may also be implemented by a GSE, Agency or Counterparty without advance notice. If the GSEs, Agencies or Counterparties cease to exist, wind down, or otherwise significantly change their business operations or if we lose our approved seller/servicer or approved counterparty status with the GSEs, Agencies or Counterparties, or if one of these parties materially limits the amount of loans we can sell to them, or we are otherwise unable to sell loans to them there could be a material adverse effect on our mortgage lending operations, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nRegulatory laws affecting our operations, or interpretations of them, may affect our mortgage lending operations.\nExisting laws, regulations, or regulatory policies and changes thereto or to the way they are interpreted can affect whether and to what extent we may be able to expand our mortgage lending activities and compliance with such requirements could expose us to fines, penalties or licensing restrictions that could affect our operations. Many states and local governments and the Federal government have enacted or may enact laws or regulations that restrict or prohibit some provisions in some programs or businesses that we currently participate in or plan to participate in the future. As such, we cannot be sure that in the future we will be able to engage in activities that were similar to those we engaged or participated in in the past thereby limiting our ability to commence new operations. As a result, we might be at a competitive disadvantage which would affect our operations and profitability.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations related to the mortgage industry that generally regulate interest rates and other charges, require certain disclosures, and require applicable licensing. In addition, other state and local laws, public policy and general principles of equity relating to the protection of consumers, unfair and deceptive practices and debt collection practices may apply to the origination, servicing and collection of our loans. Violations of certain provisions of these federal and state laws and regulations may limit our ability to collect all or part of the principal of or interest on the loans and in addition could subject us to damages and additional lawsuits, could result in the mortgagors rescinding the loans whether held by us or subsequent holders of the loans, or could cause us to repurchase the loan and thereby suffer a loss on the transaction. In addition, such violations could subject us to fines and penalties imposed by state and federal regulators and cause us to be in default under our credit and repurchase lines and could result in the loss of licenses held by us including the ability to expand or continue lending in certain areas.\nThe regulatory changes in loan originator compensation, qualified mortgage requirements and other regulatory restrictions may put us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors. Since some banks and financial institutions are not subject to the same regulatory changes as mortgage lenders, they could have an advantage over independent mortgage lenders. As a result of the nature of our operations, our capital, costs, source of funds and other similar factors may affect our ability to maintain and grow lending.\nThe CFPB has implemented rules and interpretations with strict residential mortgage loan compliance and underwriting standards as called for in the Dodd-Frank Act. The Act imposes significant liability for violation of those underwriting standards, and offers certain protection from that liability only for loans that comply with tight limitations and that do not contain certain alternative features (like balloon payments or interest only provisions). Those requirements and subsequent changes may affect our ability to originate residential mortgage loans or the profitability of those operations.\nThe CFPB continues to be active in its monitoring of the loan origination and servicing sectors, and its rules increase our regulatory compliance burden and associated costs.\nWe are subject to the regulatory, supervisory and examination authority of the CFPB, which has oversight of federal and state non-depository lending and servicing institutions, including residential mortgage originators and loan servicers. The CFPB has rulemaking authority with respect to many of the federal consumer protection laws applicable to mortgage lenders and servicers, including TILA and RESPA and the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act. The CFPB has issued a number of regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act relating to loan origination and servicing activities, including ability-to-repay and \u201cQualified Mortgage\u201d standards and other origination standards and practices as well as servicing requirements that address, among other things, periodic billing statements, certain notices and acknowledgements, prompt crediting of borrowers\u2019 accounts for payments received, additional notice, review and timing requirements with respect to delinquent borrowers, loss mitigation, prompt investigation of complaints by borrowers, and lender-placed insurance notices. The CFPB has also amended provisions of Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act regarding the determination of high-cost mortgages, and of Regulation B, to implement additional requirements under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act with respect to valuations, including appraisals and automated valuation models. The CFPB has also issued guidance to loan servicers to address potential risks to borrowers that may arise in connection with transfers of servicing. Additionally, the CFPB has increased the focus on lender liability and vendor management across the mortgage servicing and settlement services industries, which may vary depending on the services being performed.\nThe CFPB\u2019s examinations have increased, and will likely continue to increase, our administrative and compliance costs. They could also greatly influence the availability and cost of residential mortgage credit and increase servicing costs and risks. These increased costs of compliance, the effect of these rules on the lending industry and loan servicing, and any failure in our ability to comply with the new rules by their effective dates, could be detrimental to our business. The CFPB also issued guidelines on sending examiners to banks and other institutions that service and/or originate mortgages to assess whether consumers\u2019 interests are protected. The CFPB has conducted routine examinations of our business and will conduct future examinations.\nThe CFPB also has broad enforcement powers, and can order, among other things, rescission or reformation of contracts, the refund of moneys or the return of real property, restitution, disgorgement or compensation for unjust enrichment, the payment of damages or other monetary relief, public notifications regarding violations, limits on activities or functions, remediation of practices, external compliance monitoring and civil money penalties. The CFPB has been\nactive in investigations and enforcement actions and, when necessary, has issued civil money penalties to parties the CFPB determines have violated the laws and regulations it enforces. We anticipate an increase in regulatory enforcement activity by the CFPB under the new Biden administration. Our failure to comply with the federal consumer protection laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject, whether actual or alleged, could expose us to enforcement actions or potential litigation liabilities.\nIn addition, the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events or a determination by any court or regulatory agency that our policies and procedures do not comply with applicable law could impact our business operations. For example, if the violation is related to our servicing operations it could lead to downgrades by one or more rating agencies, a transfer of our servicing responsibilities, increased delinquencies on mortgage loans we service or any combination of these events. Such a determination could also require us to modify our servicing standards. The expense of complying with new or modified servicing standards may be substantial. Any such changes or revisions may have a material impact on our servicing operations, which could be detrimental to our business.\nRegulatory proceedings and related matters could adversely affect us.\nWe have been, and may in the future become, involved in regulatory proceedings. We consider most of the proceedings to be in the normal course of our business or typical for the industry; however, it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and we may not prevail in any proceedings or litigation. There could be substantial cost and management diversion in such litigation and proceedings, and any adverse determination could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, or our financial condition and results of our operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nIf we do not continue to satisfy the NYSE American continued listing requirements, our common stock could be delisted from the NYSE American.\nThe listing of our common stock on the NYSE American is contingent on our compliance with the NYSE American\u2019s conditions for continued listing, including requirements relating to maintaining minimum stockholders\u2019 equity. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those listing conditions. If the NYSE American delists our common stock from trading on its exchange due to our failure to meet the NYSE American\u2019s listing conditions, we and our securityholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cfa limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cfa reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities;\n\u25cfa limited amount of analyst coverage; and\n\u25cfa decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nOur share price has been and may continue to be volatile and the trading of our shares may be limited.\nThe market price of our securities has been volatile. We cannot guarantee that a consistently active trading market for our securities will continue. In addition, there can be no assurances that such markets will continue or that any shares which may be purchased may be sold without incurring a loss. Any such market price variation of our shares may not necessarily bear any relationship to our book value, assets, past operating results, financial condition or any other established criteria of value, and may not be indicative of the market price for the shares in the future. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be significantly affected by factors including:\n\u25cf unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u25cf general market and mortgage industry conditions;\n\u25cf mortgage and real estate fees;\n\u25cf delinquencies and defaults on outstanding mortgages;\n\u25cf loss severities on loans and REO;\n\u25cf prepayments on mortgages;\n\u25cf the regulatory environment and results of our mortgage originations;\n\u25cf mark to market adjustments related to the fair value of loans held-for-sale, mortgage servicing rights, long-term debt and derivatives;\n\u25cf interest rates; and\n\u25cf litigation.\nIn addition, significant price and volume fluctuations in the stock market have particularly affected the market prices for the securities of mortgage companies such as ours. Furthermore, general conditions in the mortgage industry may adversely affect the market price of our securities. These broad market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our securities. If our results of operations fail to meet the expectations of security analysts or investors in a future quarter, the market price of our securities could also be materially adversely affected and we may experience difficulty in raising capital.\nIssuances of additional shares of our common stock or other securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and significantly dilute stockholders.\nIn order to support our business objectives, we may raise capital through the sale of equity or convertible securities. The issuance or sale, or the proposed sale, of substantial amounts of our common stock or other securities in the public market or in private transactions could materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock or other outstanding securities and dilute our book value per share.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future and we may be restricted in paying dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future as we intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth. In addition, our existing and any future warehouse facilities or other contracts may contain covenants prohibiting dividend payments upon an occurrence of a default or otherwise. We also are prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock until our preferred stock dividends are paid under the terms of our Series B Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2021, we had cumulative undeclared dividends in arrears of approximately $19.1 million, or approximately $28.71 per outstanding share of Series B Preferred Stock. Additionally, every quarter the cumulative undeclared dividends in arrears increases by $0.5859 per Preferred B share, or approximately $390 thousand. As a result, you should not rely on an investment in our stock if you require dividend income. Capital appreciation, if any, of our stock may be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nOur principal stockholders beneficially own a large portion of our stock, and accordingly, may have control over stockholder matters and sales may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of February 28, 2022, Todd M. Pickup and Richard H. Pickup, and their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately 13.6% and 31.1%, respectively, of our outstanding common stock. Their beneficial ownership includes 395,349 shares and 534,884 shares of our common stock that Todd Pickup and Richard Pickup, respectively, has the right to acquire at any time by converting the outstanding $20.0 million in principal balance of Amended Convertible Notes due May 9, 2022, at the initial conversion price of $21.50 per share. Additionally, their beneficial ownership also includes 85,060 and 116,957 warrants that Todd Pickup and Richard Pickup, respectively, has the right to acquire at any time by converting the warrants that expire April 15, 2025, at a cash exercise price of $2.97 per share . These stockholders could exercise significant influence over our Company. Such ownership may have the effect of control over substantially all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors. Furthermore, such ownership and control may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving our Company or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our Company. We do not expect that these stockholders will vote together as a group. In addition, sales of significant amounts of shares held by these stockholders, or the prospect of these sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Maryland law, as well as our NOL Rights Plan, impose limitations that may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party.\nOur charter and bylaws contain provisions that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions include, among other things, advance notice for raising business issues or making nominations at meetings and blank check preferred stock that allows our board of directors, without stockholder approval, to designate and issue additional series of preferred stock with rights and terms as our board of directors may determine, including rights to dividends and proceeds in a liquidation that are senior to our common stock.\nWe are also subject to certain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law, which could delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the price for their common stock or may otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. This includes the \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d statute that prohibits transactions between a Maryland corporation and \u201cinterested stockholders,\u201d which is any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our then-outstanding voting stock for a period of five years unless the board of directors approved the transaction prior to the party\u2019s becoming an interested stockholder. The five-year period runs from the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder. The law also requires a super majority stockholder vote for such transactions after the end of the five-year period.\nMaryland law also provides that \u201ccontrol shares\u201d of a Maryland corporation acquired in a \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the shares eligible to vote. The control share acquisition statute would not apply to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if we were a party to the transaction. The control share acquisition statute could have the effect of discouraging offers to acquire us and of increasing the difficulty of consummating any such offers, even if our acquisition would be in our stockholders\u2019 best interests.\nWe have also adopted an NOL rights plan, pursuant to which each share of common stock also has a \u201cright\u201d attached to it. Although the NOL rights plan was adopted to help preserve the value of certain deferred tax benefits, including those generated by net operating losses, it also has the effect of deterring or delaying an acquisition of our Company by a third party. The rights are not exercisable except upon the occurrence of certain takeover-related events-most importantly, the acquisition by a third party (the \u201cAcquiring Person\u201d) of more than 4.99% of our outstanding voting shares. Once triggered, the rights entitle the stockholders, other than the Acquiring Person, to certain \u201cflip-in\u201d, \u201cflip-over\u201d and exchange rights. The effect of triggering the rights is to expose the Acquiring Person to severe dilution of its ownership interest, as the shares of our common stock (or any surviving corporation) are offered to all of the stockholders other than the Acquiring Person at a steep discount to their market value. We have in the past, and may in the future, grant waivers to the limitations imposed by our NOL rights plan. This may affect the holdings of those shareholders who obtained the waivers and may affect the protection of, and hence the ability to make use of, our NOL\u2019s.", "PERMNO": 82639, "SIC": 6162, "TIC": "IMH"}
