{"cik": "1512499", "company": "Capitol Acquisition Corp. II", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the material risks described below, which we believe represent the material risks related to our business and our securities, together with the other information contained in this Form 10-K, before making a decision to invest in our securities. This Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks described below.\nIn addition to the risks and uncertainties set forth below, we face certain material risks and uncertainties related to the business combination with Lindblad. In addition, if we succeed in effecting the business combination, we will face additional and different risks and uncertainties related to the business of Lindblad. Such material risks will be set forth in the proxy statement that we will file with the SEC in connection with the meeting to be called to approve the business combination.\nWe are a blank check company with no operating history, and, accordingly, you will not have any basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.\nWe are a blank check company with no operating results to date. Our business objective is to acquire an operating business; however, until such time as Lindblad is acquired you will have no basis of evaluating the value of your investment. We will not generate any revenues until, at the earliest, after the consummation of a business combination.\nIf we are unable to consummate a business combination, our public stockholders may be forced to wait until May 15, 2015 or later before receiving distributions from the trust account.\nWe have until May 15, 2015 to complete an initial business combination. We have no obligation to return funds to investors prior to such date unless we consummate a business combination prior thereto and only then in cases where investors have sought to tender or convert their shares. Only after the expiration of this full time period will public stockholders be entitled to distributions from the trust account if we are unable to complete a business combination. Accordingly, investors\u2019 funds may be unavailable to them until after such date.\nIf we are found to have violated the Securities Act, we could be required to repurchase securities sold in our initial public offering.\nWe issued a press release on May 9, 2013 which contained certain statements in connection with our pricing of our initial public offering. We do not believe that the statements included in the press release result in our having violated Section 5 of the Securities Act. However, if it were held by a court that we did so violate the Securities Act, we could be required to repurchase the units sold to purchasers in the initial public offering at the original purchase price, plus statutory interest from the date of purchase, until May 9, 2014. We would contest vigorously any claim that a violation of the Securities Act occurred.\nIn connection with the business combination with Lindblad, we will issue shares of common stock which would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 200,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.0001 per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.0001 per share. There are 159,400,000 authorized but unissued shares of common stock available for issuance (after appropriate reservation for the issuance of the shares upon full exercise of our outstanding warrants). Upon consummation of the business combination with Lindblad, we have agreed to issue an aggregate of 24,000,000 shares of common stock.Accordingly, your equity interest in our company will be significantly reduced.\nThe funds held in the trust account may not earn significant interest and, as a result, we may be limited to the funds held outside of the trust account and loans made available to us by our officers, directors or affiliates to fund our search for target businesses, to pay our tax obligations and to complete our initial business combination.\nWe have $38,632 available to us outside the trust account and $22,421 of interest income held in the trust account available to fund our working capital requirements. We will depend on sufficient interest being earned on the proceeds held in the trust account to provide us with additional working capital we will need to complete our initial business combination with Lindblad, as well as to pay any tax obligations that we may owe. Interest rates on permissible investments for us have been less than 1% over the last several months. Accordingly, if we do not earn a sufficient amount of interest on the funds held in the trust account and use all of the funds held outside of the trust account, we may not have sufficient funds available with which to close an initial business combination. In such event, we would need to borrow funds from our initial stockholders to operate or may be forced to cease operations. As of December 31, 2014, our Chief Executive Officer, Mark D. Ein, and our Chief Financial Officer, L. Dyson Dryden (the \"Lenders\"), had loaned us an aggregate of $470,000. On January 27, 2015, the Lenders loaned the Company an additional $191,329. On March 3, 2015, the Lenders loaned us an additional $425,000, which is not convertible. These loans, and any future loans, are evidenced by notes and would either be repaid upon the consummation of a business combination or up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant, which warrants would be identical to the sponsor\u2019s warrants. The Lenders have committed to providing us additional loans of up to $375,000. Based on the foregoing, we believe we have sufficient cash to meet our needs through at least May 15, 2015. Our sponsor, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not required to, loan us additional funds in any amount they deem reasonable at their discretion.\nIf third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in trust could be reduced and the per-share redemption price received by stockholders may be less than $10.00.\nOur placing of funds in trust may not protect those funds from third party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors and service providers we engage and prospective target businesses we negotiate with execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, they may not execute such agreements. Furthermore, even if such entities execute such agreements with us, they may seek recourse against the trust account. A court may not uphold the validity of such agreements. Accordingly, the proceeds held in trust could be subject to claims which could take priority over those of our public stockholders. If we are unable to complete a business combination within the required time period, our executive officers have agreed that they will be personally liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us. However, they may not be able to meet such obligation. Therefore, the per-share distribution from the trust account in such a situation may be less than the $10.00 per share held in the trust account as of December 31, 2014, plus any additional interest, due to such claims.\nAdditionally, if we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, or if we otherwise enter compulsory or court supervised liquidation, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we may not be able to return to our public stockholders at least the $10.00 per share held in the trust account as of December 31, 2014.\nOur stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will continue in existence only until May 15, 2015. If we have not completed a business combination by such date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders\u2019 rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of the date of distribution. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that third parties will not seek to recover from our stockholders amounts owed to them by us.\nIf we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a \u201cpreferential transfer\u201d or a \u201cfraudulent conveyance.\u201d As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to our public stockholders promptly after expiration of the deadlines set forth above, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.\nOur directors may decide not to enforce our executive officers\u2019 indemnification obligations, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders.\nIn the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below $10.00 per public share and our executive officers assert that they are unable to satisfy their obligations or that they have no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our executive officers to enforce such indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our executive officers to enforce such indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders may be reduced below $10.00 per share.\nIf we do not file and maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, public holders will only be able to exercise such warrants on a \u201ccashless basis.\u201d\nIf we do not file and maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the public warrant at the time that holders wish to exercise such warrants, they will only be able to exercise them on a \u201ccashless basis\u201d pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933. As a result, the number of shares of common stock that holders will receive upon exercise of the public warrants will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised his warrant for cash. Further, if an exemption from registration is not available, holders would not be able to exercise on a cashless basis and would only be able to exercise their warrants for cash if a current and effective prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is available. Under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed to use our best efforts to meet these conditions and to maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so. If we are unable to do so, the potential \u201cupside\u201d of the holder\u2019s investment in our company may be reduced or the warrants may expire worthless.\nAn investor will only be able to exercise a warrant if the issuance of shares of common stock upon such exercise has been registered or qualified or is deemed exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants.\nNo warrants will be exercisable for cash and we will not be obligated to issue shares of common stock unless the shares of common stock issuable upon such exercise has been registered or qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants. If the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not qualified or exempt from qualification in the jurisdictions in which the holders of the warrants reside, the warrants may be deprived of any value, the market for the warrants may be limited and they may expire worthless if they cannot be sold.\nWe may amend the terms of the warrants in a way that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of a majority of the then outstanding warrants.\nOur warrants are issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision. The warrant agreement requires the approval by the holders of a majority of the then outstanding warrants (including the sponsor\u2019s warrants) in order to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders. Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if the holders of a majority of the warrants approve of such amendment.\nOur ability to successfully effect a business combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some of whom will join us following a business combination. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct.\nOur ability to successfully effect a business combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our key personnel, at least until we have consummated our initial business combination. We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain with us for the immediate or foreseeable future.. We do not have employment agreements with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our officers. The unexpected loss of the services of our key personnel could have a detrimental effect on us.\nOur officers and directors may not have significant experience or knowledge regarding the industry in which Lindblad operates.\nWe cannot assure you that our officers and directors have enough experience or have sufficient knowledge relating to the travel services and cruise industries to make an informed decision regarding a business combination with Lindblad.\nOur officers and directors will allocate their time to other businesses thereby potentially limiting the amount of time they devote to our affairs.\nOur officers and directors are not required to commit their full time to our affairs, which could create a conflict of interest when allocating their time between our operations and their other commitments. We presently expect each of our employees to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination. All of our officers and directors are engaged in several other business endeavors and are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our affairs. If our officers\u2019 and directors\u2019 other business affairs require them to devote more substantial amounts of time to such affairs, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs and could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate our initial business combination. We cannot assure you that these conflicts will be resolved in our favor.\nOur officers\u2019 and directors\u2019 personal and financial interests may have influenced their motivation in determining whether Lindblad is appropriate for a business combination.\nAll of our officers and directors own founder shares. Such individuals have waived their right to receive distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we are unable to consummate a business combination. Accordingly, the founder shares, as well as the sponsor\u2019s warrants, and any warrants purchased by our officers or directors in the aftermarket will be worthless if we do not consummate a business combination. The personal and financial interests of our directors and officers may have influenced their motivation in identifying and selecting Lindblad with which to complete a business combination.\nNASDAQ may delist our securities from quotation on its exchange which could limit investors\u2019 ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nOur securities are listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d), a national securities exchange. On January 2, 2015, we received a notice from the NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Department stating that we failed to solicit proxies and hold an annual meeting of stockholders within 12 months after our fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, as required by NASDAQ Listing Rules 5620(a) and (b) and were therefore subject to delisting. We appealed this determination and on February 9, 2015, we received notice that NASDAQ had granted our request for continued listing, subject to certain conditions, including without limitation, that on or before May 15, 2015, we complete an initial business combination. Failure to comply with the conditions could result in the delisting of our securities from NASDAQ. Additionally, in connection with our initial business combination, it is likely that NASDAQ will require us to file a new initial listing application and meet its initial listing requirements as opposed to its more lenient continued listing requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements at that time.\nIf NASDAQ delists our securities from trading on its exchange, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u25cf reduced liquidity with respect to our securities;\n\u25cf a determination that our shares of common stock are \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in our shares of common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares of common stock;\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as \u201ccovered securities.\u201d Because our units, common stock and warrants are listed on NASDAQ, our securities are covered securities. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on NASDAQ, our securities would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our shares of common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years. However, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three year period or revenues exceeds $1 billion, or the market value of our shares of common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year. As an emerging growth company, we are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and we are exempt from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. Additionally, as an emerging growth company, we have elected to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As such, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. We cannot predict if investors will find our shares of common stock less attractive because we may rely on these provisions. If some investors find our shares of common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our shares and our share price may be more volatile.\nWe will only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds of our initial public offering, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business which may have a limited number of products or services.\nWe will only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds of our initial public offering. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be solely dependent on the performance of Lindblad.\nThis lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination.\nThe ability of our stockholders to exercise their conversion rights may not allow us to complete the business combination with Lindblad.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, we are obligated to pay Lindblad\u2019s shareholders $90,000,000 in cash. If, because of payments made to converting stockholders and other transaction costs, there are insufficient funds to pay the $90,000,000 cash portion of the merger consideration, we may need to raise additional financing in order to consummate the business combination. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such additional financing on favorable terms or at all.\nIn connection with the vote to approve the business combination with Lindblad, we will offer each public stockholder the option to vote in favor of the proposed business combination and still seek conversion of his, her or its shares.\nIn connection with the vote to approve the business combination with Lindblad, we will offer each public stockholder (but not our sponsor, officers or directors) the right to have his, her or its shares of common stock converted to cash (subject to the limitations described in the prospectus for our Offering and in this Form 10-K) regardless of whether such stockholder votes for or against such proposed business combination. We will consummate the business combination with Lindblad only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5 million upon such consummation and a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination.\nPublic stockholders, together with any affiliates of theirs or any other person with whom they are acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup,\u201d will be restricted from seeking conversion rights with respect to more than 10% of the public shares.\nIn connection with the vote to approve the proposed business combination with Lindblad, we will offer each public stockholder (but not holders of our founder shares) the right to have his, her, or its shares of common stock converted into cash. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of his or any other person with whom he is acting in concert or as a \u201cgroup\u201d will be restricted from seeking conversion rights with respect to more than 10% of the public shares. Accordingly, if you hold more than 10% of the public shares and the proposed business combination is approved, you will not be able to seek conversion rights with respect to the full amount of your shares and may be forced to hold the shares in excess of 10% or sell them in the open market. We cannot assure you that the value of such excess shares will appreciate over time following the business combination or that the market price of our shares of common stock will exceed the per-share conversion price.\nWe may require stockholders who wish to convert their shares in connection with the proposed business combination with Lindblad to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights.\nWe may require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares in connection with the proposed business combination with Lindblad to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent at any time prior to the vote taken at the stockholder meeting relating to such business combination or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the Depository Trust Company\u2019s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System. In order to obtain a physical stock certificate, a stockholder\u2019s broker and/or clearing broker, DTC and our transfer agent will need to act to facilitate this request. It is our understanding that stockholders should generally allot at least two weeks to obtain physical certificates from the transfer agent. However, because we do not have any control over this process or over the brokers or DTC, it may take significantly longer than two weeks to obtain a physical stock certificate. While we have been advised that it takes a short time to deliver shares through the DWAC System, we cannot assure you of this fact. Accordingly, if it takes longer than we anticipate for stockholders to deliver their shares, stockholders who wish to convert may be unable to meet the deadline for exercising their conversion rights and thus may be unable to convert their shares.\nIf we require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares to comply with specific requirements for conversion, such converting stockholders may be unable to sell their securities when they wish to in the event that the proposed business combination is not approved.\nIf we require public stockholders who wish to convert their shares to comply with specific requirements for conversion and such proposed business combination is not consummated, we will promptly return such certificates to the tendering public stockholders. Accordingly, investors who attempted to convert their shares in such a circumstance will be unable to sell their securities after the failed acquisition until we have returned their securities to them. The market price for our shares of common stock may decline during this time and you may not be able to sell your securities when you wish to, even while other stockholders that did not seek conversion may be able to sell their securities.\nOur sponsor, officers and directors control a substantial interest in us and thus may influence certain actions requiring a stockholder vote.\nOur sponsor, officers and directors collectively own 20% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. In connection with the vote for the proposed business combination with Lindblad, our sponsor, as well as all of our officers and directors, have agreed to vote their founder shares as well as any shares of common stock acquired in the aftermarket in favor of such proposed business combination.\nOur board of directors is and will be divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. As a consequence of our \u201cstaggered\u201d board of directors, only a minority of the board of directors will be considered for election.\nOur outstanding warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of shares of common stock.\nWe have issued the warrants to purchase 10,000,000 shares of common stock as part of the units sold in our initial public offering and the sponsor\u2019s warrants to purchase 5,600,000 shares of common stock. We may also issue additional warrants to our officers, directors, sponsor or their affiliates upon conversion of promissory notes issued to such persons or entities for loans made to supplement our working capital requirements, as described elsewhere in this Form 10-K and the prospectus for our initial public offering. The sale, or even the possibility of sale, of the shares underlying the warrants could have an adverse effect on the market price for our securities or on our ability to obtain future financing. If and to the extent these warrants are exercised, you may experience dilution to your holdings.\nWe may redeem the warrants at a time that is not beneficial to public investors.\nWe may call the public warrants for redemption at any time after the redemption criteria described in the prospectus for our initial public offering have been satisfied. If we call the public warrants for redemption, public stockholders may be forced to accept a nominal redemption price or sell or exercise the warrants when they may not wish to do so.\nOur management\u2019s ability to require holders of our warrants to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis will cause holders to receive fewer shares of common stock upon their exercise of the warrants than they would have received had they been able to exercise their warrants for cash.\nIf we call our public warrants for redemption after the redemption criteria described in the prospectus for our initial public offering have been satisfied, our management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise its warrant (including any warrants held by our initial stockholders or their permitted transferees) to do so on a \u201ccashless basis.\u201d If our management chooses to require holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, the number of shares of common stock received by a holder upon exercise will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised his warrant for cash. This will have the effect of reducing the potential \u201cupside\u201d of the holder\u2019s investment in our company.\nIf our stockholders exercise their registration rights with respect to their securities, it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares of common stock and the existence of these rights may make it more difficult to effect a business combination.\nOur sponsor, officers and directors are entitled to make a demand that we register the resale of their founder shares at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which their shares may be released from escrow. Additionally, the purchasers of the sponsor warrants are entitled to demand that we register the resale of their warrants and any other warrants we issue to them (and the underlying shares of common stock) at any time after we consummate a business combination. The presence of these additional shares of common stock trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete a business combination.\nA company that, among other things, is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, trading or holding certain types of securities would be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (\u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d). Since we will invest the proceeds held in the trust account, it is possible that we could be deemed an investment company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in trust may be invested by the trustee only in United States treasuries. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend to meet the requirements for the exemption provided in Rule 3a-1 promulgated under the Investment Company Act.\nIf we are nevertheless deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be subject to certain restrictions that may make it more difficult for us to complete a business combination, including:\n\u25cf restrictions on the nature of our investments; and\n\u25cf restrictions on the issuance of securities.\nIn addition, we may have imposed upon us certain burdensome requirements, including:\n\u25cf registration as an investment company;\n\u25cf adoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and\n\u25cf reporting, record keeping, voting, proxy, compliance policies and procedures and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations.\nCompliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expense for which we have not allotted.\nLindblad is privately held, which may present certain challenges to us, including the lack of available information on its operations.\nLindblad is privately held. We are relying on the ability of our management team to obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential returns from investing in Lindblad. If we are unable to uncover all material information about Lindblad, we may not make a fully informed investment decision, and you may lose money on your investments.\nCompliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will require substantial financial and management resources and may increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties and/or stockholder litigation. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports could harm our business. Lindblad may also not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding the adequacy of internal controls. The development of the internal controls of Lindblad to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete the proposed business combination. Furthermore, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation of adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities.\nWe do not intend to pay any dividends until our consummation of a business combination at the earliest.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our shares of common stock to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of an initial business combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of a business combination. The payment of any dividends subsequent to a business combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. It is the present intention of our board of directors to retain all earnings, if any, for use in our business operations and, accordingly, our board of directors does not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, any gain you will realize on our securities will result solely from the appreciation of such securities.", "PERMNO": 14045, "SIC": 4700, "TIC": "LIND"}
