{"cik": "1702744", "company": "Simply Good Foods Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-10-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision. Our business, prospects, financial condition or operating results could be harmed by any of these risks, as well as other risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks, and, as a result, you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe may not be able to compete successfully in the highly competitive nutritional snacking industry.\nThe nutritious snacking industry is large and intensely competitive because consumers are seeking simpler, \u201ccleaner\u201d and more sustainable eating habits. Our business is committed to providing people a more nutritious way to eat. As a result, we compete in the nutritional snacking industry, which is included in the general snack foods industry. Competitive factors in the nutritional snacking industry include product quality, taste, brand awareness among consumers, nutritional content, simpler and less processed ingredients, innovation of \u201con-trend\u201d snacks, variety of snacks offered, grocery aisle placement, access to retailer shelf space, price, advertising and promotion, product packaging and package design. We compete in this market against numerous multinational, regional and local companies principally on the basis of our low-carb, low-sugar and protein-rich nutritional content, product taste and quality, our brand recognition and loyalty, marketing, advertising, price and the ability to satisfy specific consumer dietary needs. An increasing focus on healthy and simpler products in the marketplace will likely increase these competitive pressures within the category in future periods.\nOur competitors in the nutritional snacking industry include companies selling branded weight loss programs who support these programs by offering a wide variety of diet foods, meal replacement bars, shakes and nutritional supplements, and through the promotion of weight loss and weight management approaches such as paleo, vegan, gluten free, vegetarian and others. Views towards nutritional snacking, weight loss and management, and other nutritional approaches, are cyclical and trendy in nature, with constantly changing consumer perceptions. In addition to remaining competitive through the quality of our products, consumer perceptions of the Atkins\u2019 weight management approach and the effectiveness of a low-carb, low-sugar and protein-rich eating approach must continue to be viewed favorably, or our business and reputation may be materially and adversely affected. If other weight management approaches become more popular, or are generally perceived to be more effective than Atkins, we may not be able to compete effectively. Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than us and sell brands that may be more widely recognized than Atkins\u2019 brands. Our current and potential competitors may offer products similar to our products, a wider range of products than we offer, and may offer such products at more competitive prices than we do. Local or regional markets often have significant additional competitors, many of whom offer products similar to ours and may have unique ties to regional or national retail chains. Any increased competition from new entrants into the nutritional snacking industry or any increased success by existing competition could result in reductions in our sales, require us to reduce our prices, or both, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to successfully implement our growth strategies on a timely basis, or at all, our ability to increase our revenue and operating profits could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future success depends, in large part, on our ability to implement our growth strategies effectively, including expanding on a low-carb, low-sugar and protein-rich healthy lifestyle while maintaining the traditional identity of our brands and the loyalty of our consumers. However, we may not succeed in implementing our growth strategies effectively. In December 2016, we transitioned from a single- to multibrand portfolio with the acquisition of Wellness Foods and the addition of the SimplyProtein\u00ae brand. On August 21, 2019, we announced our pending acquisition of Quest, a healthy lifestyle food company. We expect to focus on nutritional snacking in the future and intend to add additional brands to our product portfolio. As a multi-brand business, we face increased complexities and greater uncertainty with respect to consumer trends and demands than as a single-brand business. Our ability to successfully expand our nutritional snacking brands and other growth strategies depends on, among other things, our ability to identify, and successfully cater to, new demographics and consumer trends, develop new and innovative products, identify and acquire additional product lines and businesses, secure shelf space in grocery stores, wholesale clubs and other retailers, increase consumer awareness of our brands, enter into distribution and other strategic arrangements with third-party retailers and other potential distributors of our products, and compete with numerous other companies and products. In addition, self-directed lifestyle consumers of products may have different preferences and spending habits than the consumers of traditional weight loss products. We may not be successful in reaching and maintaining the loyalty of new consumers to the same extent, or at all, as we have with our historical consumers. We believe traditional weight management consumers actively on the Atkins program represent approximately 15% of our current consumer base whereas the remaining approximate 85% of our consumers are not currently on a program diet. We may not be successful in evolving our advertising and other efforts to appeal to both our branded weight loss consumers and self-directed healthy lifestyle consumers. If we are unable to identify and capture new audiences and demographics, our ability to successfully integrate additional brands will be adversely affected. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategies, expand our brands, or continue to maintain growth in our sales at our current rate, or at all. If we fail to implement our growth strategies or if we invest resources in growth strategies that ultimately prove unsuccessful, our sales and profitability may be negatively affected, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we do not continually enhance our brand recognition, increase distribution of our products, attract new consumers to our brands and introduce new and innovative products, either on a timely basis or at all, our business may suffer.\nThe nutritional snacking industry is subject to rapid and frequent changes in consumer demands. Because consumers are constantly seeking new products and strategies to achieve their healthy eating goals, our success relies heavily on our ability to continue to develop and market new and innovative products and extensions. New product sales represent a growing and important portion of our net sales. In order to respond to new and evolving consumer demands, achieve market acceptance and keep pace with new nutritional, weight management, technological and other developments, we must constantly introduce new and innovative products into the market, some of which may not be accepted by consumers, may be sent to market prematurely or may not be consistent with our quality and taste standards. Accordingly, we may not be successful in developing, introducing on a timely basis or marketing any new or enhanced products. If we are unable to commercialize new products, our revenue may not grow as expected, which would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on sales to a limited number of retailers for a substantial majority of our net sales, and the loss of one or more such retailers may materially harm our business. In addition, we maintain \u201cat will\u201d contracts with these retailers, which do not require recurring or minimum purchase amounts of our products.\nA substantial majority of our sales are generated from a limited number of retailers. Sales to our largest retailer, Walmart, represented approximately 44% of sales in fiscal year 2019, of which approximately 36% is through their mass retail channel and approximately 8% is through their club channel. Although the composition of our significant retailers may vary from period-to-period, we expect that most of our net sales will continue to come from a relatively small number of retailers for the foreseeable future. These retailers may take actions that affect us for reasons that we cannot anticipate or control, such as their financial condition, changes in their business strategy, operations, the perceived quality of their products and the introduction of competing products. There can be no assurance that Walmart or our other significant retailers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past, particularly as increasingly powerful retailers continue to demand lower pricing.\nOur retailers typically do not provide us with firm, long- or short-term volume purchase commitments. As a result, we could have periods with little to no orders for our products while still incurring costs related to workforce maintenance, marketing, general corporate and debt service. Furthermore, despite operating in different channels, our retailers sometimes compete for the same consumers. As a result of actual or perceived conflicts resulting from competition, retailers may take actions that negatively affect us. We may not be able to find new retailers to supplement our revenue in periods when we experience reduced purchase orders, or recover fixed costs as a result of experiencing reduced purchase orders. Periods of reduced purchase orders could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nConversely, from time to time, we may experience unanticipated increases in orders of our products from these retailers that can create supply chain problems and may result in unfilled orders. If we are unable to meet increased demand for our products, our reputation with these retailers may be harmed. Unanticipated fluctuations in product requirements could result in fluctuations in our results from quarter-to-quarter. Consolidation among retailers may also materially and adversely affect our results. An increase in the concentration of our sales to large customers may negatively affect our profitability due to the effect of higher shelving fees and reduced volumes of product sold. Furthermore, as retailers consolidate or account for a larger percentage of our sales, they may reduce the number of branded products they offer in order to accommodate private label products and pressure us to lower the prices of our products.\nOur growth may be limited if we are unable to add additional shelf or retail space for our products.\nOur results depend on our ability to drive revenue growth, in part, by expanding the distribution channels for our products. Our ability to do so may be limited by an inability to secure new retailers, or additional shelf and retail space for our products. Shelf and retail space for nutritional snacks is limited and subject to competitive and other pressures. There can be no assurance that retailers will provide sufficient, or any, shelf space, nor that online retailers will provide online access to their platform to enable us to meet our growth objectives.\nConsumers generally shop for the Atkins brand first, then choose a product form or flavor second. Our ability to shelf all of Atkins' products together in one area at retail enables consumers to easily find all Atkins products when shopping. Any customer decision to separate Atkins products by form (bars, RTDs or confections) could negatively affect our business.\nUnattractive shelf placement and pricing may put our products at a disadvantage compared to those of our competitors. Even if we obtain shelf space or preferable shelf placement, our new and existing products may fail to achieve the sales expectations set by our retailers, potentially causing these retailers to remove our products from their shelves. Additionally, an increase in the quantity and quality of private-label products in the product categories in which we compete could create more pressure for shelf space and placement for branded products within each such category, which could materially and adversely affect our sales.\nChanges in consumer preferences, perceptions of healthy food products and discretionary spending may negatively affect our brand loyalty and net sales, and materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe focus on products that are, or that we believe are, perceived to have positive effects on health, and compete in a market that relies on innovation and evolving consumer preferences. The processed food industry in general, and the nutritional snacking industry in particular, is subject to changing consumer trends, demands and preferences. Emerging science, Atkins\u2019 nutritional approach and theories regarding health are constantly evolving. Products or methods of eating once considered healthy may become disfavored by consumers, scientifically disproven or no longer be perceived as healthy. Trends within the food industry change often and our failure to anticipate, identify or react to changes in these trends could, among other things, lead to reduced consumer demand, shelf or retail space and price reductions, and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, certain ingredients used in our products may become negatively perceived by consumers, resulting in reformulation of existing products to remove such ingredients, which may negatively affect the taste or other qualities of our products. Factors that may affect consumer perception of healthy products include dietary trends and attention to different nutritional aspects of foods, concerns regarding the health effects of specific ingredients and nutrients, trends away from specific ingredients in products and increasing awareness of the environmental and social effects of product production.\nConsumer perceptions of the nutritional profile of low-carb, low-sugar and protein-rich eating practices and products may shift and consumers may no longer perceive products with fewer carbohydrates, higher levels of protein, higher levels of fat and additional fiber as healthy. Approaches regarding weight management and healthy lifestyles are the subject of numerous studies and publications, often with differentiating views and opinions, some of which may be adverse to us. Conflicting scientific information on what constitutes good nutrition, diet fads and other weight loss trends may materially and adversely affect our business from time to time. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and other consumer trends and to offer products that appeal to their needs and preferences on a timely and affordable basis. A change in consumer discretionary spending, due to economic downturn or other reasons may also materially and adversely affect our sales, and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of, a disruption in or an inability to efficiently operate our fulfillment network could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor our U.S. operations, we utilize a single distribution center in Greenfield, Indiana. Substantially all of our inventory is shipped directly to our retailers from this center by a third-party operator. We rely significantly on the orderly operation of this center. If complications arise, or if the facility is damaged or destroyed, our ability to deliver inventory on a timely basis will be significantly impaired, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on a single-sourced logistics provider for distribution and product shipments in the United States. Our utilization of delivery services for shipments is subject to risks that may affect the ability to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs including increases in fuel prices, employee strikes and inclement weather. From time to time, we may change third-party transportation providers and we could face logistical difficulties that could adversely affect deliveries. In addition, we could incur costs and expend resources in connection with such change, and fail to obtain terms as favorable as those we currently receive.\nDisruptions at our distribution facility or in our operations due to natural or man-made disasters, fire, flooding, terrorism or other catastrophic events, system failure, labor disagreements or shipping problems may result in delays in the delivery of products to retailers.\nShortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of our core ingredients, packaging and products could materially and adversely affect our operating results as we rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers to supply our core ingredients and a limited number of contract manufacturers to manufacture our products.\nThe core ingredients used in manufacturing our products include soy, nuts, dairy and cocoa. We rely on a limited number of third party suppliers to provide these ingredients, a portion of which are international companies. There may be a limited market supply of any of these core ingredients. Any disruption in supply could materially and adversely affect our business, particularly our profitability and margins. Events that adversely affect our suppliers could impair our ability to obtain core ingredient inventories in the quantities desired. Such events include problems with our suppliers\u2019 businesses, finances, labor relations, ability to import core ingredients, costs, production, insurance, reputation and weather conditions during growing, harvesting or shipping, including flood, drought, frost and earthquakes, as well as man-made disasters or other catastrophic occurrences.\nOur financial performance depends in large part on our ability to purchase core ingredients and packaging in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. We may not have continued supply, pricing or exclusive access to core ingredients and packaging from these sources. Any of our suppliers could discontinue or seek to alter their relationships with us. We may be adversely affected by increased demand for our specific core ingredients, a reduction in overall supply of required core ingredients, suppliers raising their prices, and increases in the cost of packaging and distributing core ingredients. Additionally, we may be adversely affected if suppliers stop selling to us or enter into arrangements that impair their abilities to provide us with core ingredients.\nWe rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers to manufacture our products. If any of these manufacturers experience adverse effects on their businesses or are unable to continue manufacturing our products at required levels, on a timely basis, or at all, we may be forced to seek other manufacturers. In addition, our contract manufacturers independently contract for and obtain some of the core ingredients in our products. If contract manufactures are unable to obtain these core ingredients in the required amounts or at all, their ability to manufacture our products would be adversely affected. It could take a significant period of time to locate and qualify such alternative production sources. We may not be able to identify and qualify new manufacturers in a timely manner that could allocate sufficient capacity to meet our requirements, which could adversely affect our ability to make timely deliveries of products. Furthermore, we may be unable to negotiate pricing or other terms with existing or new manufacturers as favorable as what we currently enjoy. In addition, there is no guarantee a new manufacturing partner could accurately replicate the production process and taste profile of the existing products.\nWe are subject to risks associated with protection of our trade secrets by our third party contract manufacturers. If our contract manufacturers fail to protect our trade secrets, either intentionally or unintentionally, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. If we experience significant increased demand for our products, or need to replace an existing supplier or manufacturer, additional supplies of core ingredients or manufacturers may not be available when required, on acceptable terms, or at all. Suppliers may not allocate sufficient capacity to meet our requirements, fill our orders in a timely manner or meet our strict quality standards. Even if our existing suppliers and manufacturers are able to expand their capacities to meet our needs, or we are able to find new sources of core ingredients or new contract manufacturers, we may encounter delays in production, inconsistencies in quality and added costs. We may not be able to pass increased costs onto the consumer immediately, if at all, which may decrease or eliminate our profitability. Any manufacturing and/or supply disruptions or cost increases could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet consumer demand for our products and result in lower net sales and profitability, both in the short and long term.\nWe rely in part on our third-party contract manufacturers to maintain the quality of our products. The failure or inability of contract manufacturers to comply with the specifications and requirements of our products could result in product recall, which could materially and adversely affect our reputation and subject us to significant liability should the consumption of any of our products cause or be claimed to cause illness or physical harm. Our products implicate risks such as product contamination, spoilage, product tampering, other adulteration, mislabeling and misbranding. We also license certain products that contain our brand and logo, but which are produced and distributed exclusively by third parties of whom we have limited control. In addition, we do not own our warehouse facility, but it is managed for us by a third party.\nUnder certain circumstances, we may be required to, or may voluntarily, recall or withdraw products. For example, in 2016, as part of a larger national recall by several other food companies, we incurred losses, including recalled product as a result of potential contamination from an ingredient supplied to one of our third-party manufacturers at their manufacturing center. While the contamination did not result in any consumer illness, and we were indemnified for a substantial portion of our direct product loss, the recall may have damaged our reputation. A widespread recall or withdrawal of any of ours or Atkins\u2019 licensed products may negatively and significantly affect our sales and profitability and could result in significant losses depending on the costs of the recall, destruction of product inventory, reduction in product availability, and reaction of competitors and consumers.\nWe may be subject to claims or lawsuits, including class actions lawsuits (which could significantly increase any adverse settlements or rulings) or judgments, resulting in liability for actual or claimed injuries, illness or death. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Whether or not a product liability claim or lawsuit is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or physical harm could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential consumers and our corporate and brand image. Moreover, claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. We maintain product liability insurance in an amount that we believe to be adequate. However, we may incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our insurance coverage. A product liability judgment against us or a product recall could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIngredient and packaging costs are volatile and may rise significantly, which may negatively affect the profitability of our business.\nWe negotiate the prices for large quantities of core ingredients, such as soy, nuts, dairy and cocoa, as well as packaging materials. A number of these ingredients are manufactured and packaged in Canada. Costs of ingredients and packaging are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, fluctuations in currency and exchange rates, weather conditions, natural or man-made disasters, consumer demand and changes in governmental trade and agricultural programs. Continued volatility in the prices of the core ingredients and other supplies we purchase could increase our cost of goods sold and reduce our profitability.\nWe do not use hedges or forward pricing for availability of any core ingredients. As such, any material upward movement in core ingredient pricing could negatively affect our margins if we are not able to pass these costs on to our consumers, or our sales if we are forced to increase our prices. If we are not successful in managing our ingredient and packaging costs, if we are unable to increase our prices to cover increased costs or if such price increases reduce our sales volumes, then such increases in costs will materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our core ingredient contracts have minimum volume commitments that could require purchases without matching revenue during weaker sales periods. Future core ingredient prices may be effected by new laws or regulations, tariffs, suppliers\u2019 allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, natural disasters, volatility in the price of crude oil and related petrochemical products and changes in exchange rates.\nSevere weather conditions and natural disasters such as fires, floods, droughts, hurricanes, earthquakes and tornadoes can affect crop supplies, manufacturing facilities and distribution activities, and negatively affect the operating results of our business.\nSevere weather conditions and natural disasters, such as fires, floods, droughts, frosts, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, insect infestations and plant disease, may affect the supply of core ingredients used to make food products, or may prevent the manufacturing or distribution of food products by third parties. Competing manufacturers might be affected differently by weather conditions and natural disasters, depending on the location of their sources of supplies and manufacturing or distribution facilities. If supplies of core ingredients available to us are reduced, we may not be able to find enough supplemental supply sources on favorable terms, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, because we rely on few contract manufacturers for a majority of our manufacturing needs and a single distribution warehouse, adverse weather conditions could affect the ability for those third-party operators to manufacture and store our products.\nIf our brands or reputation are damaged, the perception of our brand by our consumers, distributors and retailers may diminish, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe we have built our reputation on the efficacy of our nutritional approach, as well as the high quality flavor and nutritional content of our food. We must protect and expand on the value of our brands to continue to be successful in the future. Any incident that erodes consumer affinity for our brands could significantly reduce our value and damage our business. For example, negative third-party reports regarding the Atkins nutritional approach or the quality of our food, whether accurate or not, may adversely affect consumer perceptions, which could in turn cause the Atkins\u2019 brand value to suffer and adversely affect our business. In addition, if we are forced, or voluntarily elect, to recall certain products, including frozen foods or licensed products over which we may not have full quality control, the public perception of the quality of our food may be diminished. We may also be adversely affected by news or other negative publicity, regardless of accuracy, regarding other aspects of our business, such as public health concerns, illness, safety, security breaches of confidential consumer or employee information, employee related claims relating to alleged employment discrimination, health care and benefit issues or government or industry findings concerning our retailers, distributors, manufacturers or others across the industry supply chain.\nAs part of our marketing initiatives, we have entered into agreements with certain public figures to market and endorse our products. While we maintain specific selection criteria and are diligent in our efforts to seek out public figures that resonate genuinely and effectively with our consumer audience, the individuals we choose to market and endorse our products may fall into negative favor with the general public. Because our consumers may associate the public figures that market and endorse our products with us, any negative publicity on behalf of such individuals may result in negative publicity about us and our products. This negative publicity could materially and adversely affect our brand and reputation as well as our revenue and profits.\nNegative information, including inaccurate information, about us on social media may harm our reputation and brand, which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar channels that provide individuals with access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. The availability of information on social media platforms is virtually immediate, as is its effect. Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. The opportunity for dissemination of information, including inaccurate information, is potentially limitless. Information concerning our business and/or products may be posted on such platforms at any time. Negative views regarding our products and the efficacy of the Atkins eating approach have been posted on various social media platforms, may continue to be posted in the future, and are out of our control. Regardless of their accuracy or authenticity, such information and views may be adverse to our interests and may harm our reputation and brand. The harm may be immediate without affording an opportunity for redress or correction. Ultimately, the risks associated with any such negative publicity cannot be eliminated or completely mitigated and may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must expend resources to maintain consumer awareness of our brands, build brand loyalty and generate interest in our products. Our marketing strategies and channels will evolve and our programs may or may not be successful.\nWe believe that the Atkins nutritional approach is broadly known and followed in the United States and many other countries in which we operate. In order to remain competitive and expand and keep shelf placement for our products, we may need to increase our marketing and advertising spending to maintain and increase consumer awareness, protect and grow our existing market share or promote new products, which could affect our operating results. Substantial advertising and promotional expenditures may be required to maintain or improve our brand\u2019s market position or to introduce new products to the market, and participants in our industry are increasingly engaging with non-traditional media, including consumer outreach through social media and web-based channels, which may not prove successful. An increase\nin our marketing and advertising efforts may not maintain our current reputation, or lead to increased brand awareness. Moreover, we may be unable to maintain current awareness of our brand due to any potential fragmentation of our marketing efforts as we continue to focus on a low-carb, low-sugar and protein-rich nutritional approach for everyday snacking consumers. In addition, we consistently evaluate our product lines to determine whether or not to discontinue certain products. Discontinuing product lines may increase our profitability but could reduce our sales and hurt our brands, and a reduction in sales of certain products could result in a reduction in sales of other products. The discontinuation of product lines may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to maintain or increase prices, our margins may decrease.\nWe rely in part on price increases to offset cost increases and improve the profitability of our business. Our ability to maintain prices or effectively implement price increases may be affected by a number of factors, including competition, effectiveness of our marketing programs, the continuing strength of our brand, market demand and general economic conditions, including inflationary pressures. During challenging economic times, consumers may be less willing or able to pay a price premium for our branded products and may shift purchases to lower-priced or other value offerings, making it more difficult for us to maintain prices and/or effectively implement price increases. In addition, our retail partners and distributors may pressure us to rescind price increases that we have announced or already implemented, whether through a change in list price or increased promotional activity. If we are unable to maintain or increase prices for our products or must increase promotional activity, our margins may be adversely affected. Furthermore, price increases generally result in volume losses, as consumers purchase fewer units. If such losses are greater than expected or if we lose distribution due to a price increase, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe intend to grow through acquisitions or joint ventures and we may not successfully integrate, operate or realize the anticipated benefits of such business combinations.\nAs part of our strategic initiatives, we intend to pursue acquisitions or joint ventures, such as our acquisition of Wellness Foods and the pending Acquisition of Quest, a healthy lifestyle food company. Our acquisition strategy is based on identifying and acquiring brands with products that complement our existing products and identifying and acquiring brands in new categories and new geographies for the purpose of expanding our platform of nutritional snacks and potentially other food products. Although we regularly evaluate multiple acquisition candidates, we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, negotiate acquisitions of identified candidates on favorable terms, or integrate acquisitions that we complete.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including intense competition for suitable acquisition targets, which could increase target prices and/or materially and adversely affect our ability to consummate deals on favorable terms, the potential unavailability of financial resources necessary to consummate acquisitions, the risk that we improperly value and price a target, the potential inability to identify all of the risks and liabilities inherent in a target company or assets notwithstanding our diligence efforts, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operations of our business and additional strain on our existing personnel, increased leverage resulting from the additional debt financing that may be required to complete an acquisition, dilution of our net current book value per share if we issue additional equity securities to finance an acquisition, difficulties in identifying suitable acquisition targets or in completing any transactions identified on sufficiently favorable terms and the need to obtain regulatory or other governmental approvals that may be necessary to complete acquisitions.\nAny future acquisitions may pose risks associated with entry into new geographic markets, including outside the United States and our current international markets, distribution channels, lines of business or product categories, where we may not have significant prior experience and where we may not be as successful or profitable as we are in businesses and geographic regions where we have greater familiarity and brand recognition. Potential acquisitions may entail significant transaction costs and require a significant amount of management time and distraction from our core business, even where we are unable to consummate or decide not to pursue a particular transaction.\nIn addition to the risks above, even when acquisitions are completed, integration of acquired entities can involve significant difficulties. These include failure to achieve financial or operating objectives with respect to an acquisition, systems, operational and managerial controls and procedures, the need to modify systems or to add management resources, difficulties in the integration and retention of consumers or personnel and the integration and effective deployment of operations or technologies, amortization of acquired assets (which would reduce future reported earnings), possible adverse short-term effects on cash flows or operating results, integrating personnel with diverse backgrounds and organizational cultures, coordinating sales and marketing functions and failure to obtain and retain key personnel of an acquired business. Failure to manage these acquisition growth risks could have an adverse effect on our business.\nFor more information, please see \u201cRisks Related to the Acquisition\u201d below.\nOur indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and ability to operate our company, and we may incur additional debt.\nAs of August 31, 2019, we had approximately $196.5 million in outstanding indebtedness and a revolving credit facility with availability of $75 million. We also intend to fund a portion of the purchase price of the Acquisition with committed financing pursuant to\nadditional debt commitments from Barclays, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs. Our current and future debt level and the terms of our debt arrangements could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to successfully implement our growth strategies. In addition, under the credit facilities governing our indebtedness, we have granted the lenders a security interest in substantially all of our assets, including the assets of our subsidiaries and an affiliate.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by the other risk factors described herein. If we do not generate enough cash flow to pay our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell our assets, borrow more money or raise equity. We may not be able to take any of these actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us, or at all.\nThe credit facilities governing our debt arrangements contain financial and other covenants.\nThe credit facilities governing our existing debt arrangements contain certain financial and other covenants. Our revolving credit facility has a maximum total net leverage ratio equal to or less than 6.25:1.00 (with a reduction to 6.00:1.00 on and after the third anniversary of the closing date of the credit facilities) contingent on credit extensions in excess of 30% of the total amount of commitments available under the revolving credit facility, and limitations on our ability to, among other things, incur and/or undertake asset sales and other dispositions, liens, indebtedness, certain acquisitions and investments, consolidations, mergers, reorganizations and other fundamental changes, payment of dividends and other distributions to equity and warrant holders, and prepayments of material subordinated debt, in each case, subject to customary exceptions materially consistent with credit facilities of such type and size. Any failure to comply with the restrictions of the credit facilities may result in an event of default. The credit facilities governing our existing debt arrangements bear interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could materially and adversely affect our cash flow.\nChanges in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings and/or cash flows.\nOur indebtedness under our revolving credit facility bears interest at variable interest rates that use the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark rate. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR quotations after 2021 (the \u201cFCA Announcement\u201d). The FCA announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be assured after 2021, and LIBOR may cease to exist or otherwise be unsuitable for use as a benchmark. Recent proposals for LIBOR reforms may result in the establishment of new methods of calculating LIBOR or the establishment of one or more alternative benchmark rates. Although our revolving credit facility provides for successor base rates, the successor base rates may be related to LIBOR, and the consequences of any potential cessation, modification or other reform of LIBOR cannot be predicted at this time. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to amend our revolving credit facility, and we cannot predict what alternative interest rate(s) will be negotiated with our counterparties. As a result, our interest expense may increase, our ability to refinance some or all of our existing indebtedness may be effected and our available cash flow may be adversely affected.\nAll of our products must comply with regulations of the FDA as well as state and local regulations. Any non-compliance with the FDA or other applicable regulations could harm our business.\nOur products must comply with various FDA rules and regulations, including those regarding product manufacturing, food safety, required testing and appropriate labeling of our products. The FDA has not defined nutrient content claims with respect to carbohydrates, but has not objected to the use of net carbohydrate information on food labels if the label adequately explains how the term is used so that it would not be false or misleading to consumers. The FDA requires all carbohydrates per serving to be listed on the Nutrition Facts Panel (\u201cNFP\u201d) of a package. In addition to the information on the NFP, we use the term \u201cnet carbohydrate\u201d (or \u201cnet carbs\u201d) on our Atkins' packaging to assist consumers in tracking the carbohydrates in that serving of food that effect their blood sugar (glucose) levels. We determine the number of net carbs in a serving by subtracting fiber, and sugar alcohols if any, from the actual number of carbohydrates listed on the NFP. Fiber and sugar alcohols can be subtracted from the carbohydrates because they minimally effect blood sugar. It is possible that FDA regulations and/or their interpretations may change related to, for example, definitions of certain of our core ingredients, such as fiber, labeling requirements for describing other ingredients or nutrients, such as sugar alcohols or protein, or disclosures of any ingredient labeled as genetically modified (\u201cGMO\u201d). As such, there is a risk that our products could become non-compliant with the FDA\u2019s regulations, and any such non-compliance could harm our business.\nIn addition, if FDA or other regulations restrict us from labeling and marketing certain ingredients or product attributes, such as fiber or \u201cnet carb\u201d count, we may be unable to effectively reach our target demographics, promote what we believe to be the benefits of our products or communicate that our products are composed of what we consider to be low-carb, low-sugar and protein-rich ingredients.\nWe must rely on the contract manufacturers we engage to produce our products to maintain compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Although we require our contract manufacturers to be compliant with regulatory requirements, we do not have direct control over such facilities. Failure of our contract manufacturers to comply with applicable regulation could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nConflicts between state and federal law regarding definitions of our core ingredients, as well as labeling requirements, may lead to non-compliance with state and local regulations. For example, certain states may maintain narrower definitions of certain ingredients, as well as more stringent labeling requirements, of which we are unaware. Any non-compliance at the state or local level could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur advertising is regulated for accuracy, and if our advertising is determined to be false or misleading, we may face fines or sanctions.\nOur advertising is subject to regulation by the FTC under the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits dissemination of false or misleading advertising. In addition, the National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc., which we refer to as NAD, administers a self-regulatory program of the advertising industry to ensure truth and accuracy in national advertising. NAD both monitors national advertising and entertains inquiries and challenges from competing companies and consumers. Should our advertising be determined to be false or misleading, we may have to pay damages, withdraw our campaign and possibly face fines or sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results.\nDisruptions in the worldwide economy may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse and uncertain economic conditions may affect distributor, retailer and consumer demand for our products. In addition, our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, retailers, consumers and creditors may suffer. Consumers may shift purchases to lower-priced or other perceived value offerings during economic downturns, making it more difficult to sell our premium products. Due to the relative costs of our products, during economic downturns, it may be more difficult to convince consumers to switch to or continue to use our brands or convince new users to choose our brands without expensive sampling programs and price promotions. In particular, consumers may reduce their purchases of products without GMOs, gluten or preservatives when there are conventional offerings of similar products, which generally have lower retail prices. In addition, consumers may choose to purchase private-label products rather than branded products because they are generally less expensive. Distributors and retailers may become more conservative in their ordering in response to these conditions and seek to reduce their inventories. Our results of operations depend on, among other things, our ability to maintain and increase sales volume with our existing distributors and retailers, to attract new consumers and to provide products that appeal to consumers at prices they are willing and able to pay. Prolonged unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability.\nChanges in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activities, increase our operating costs, reduce demand for our products or result in litigation.\nElements of our business, including the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, health and safety practices, transportation and use of many of our products, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as the laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies outside the United States in markets in which our products or components thereof, such as packaging, may be made, manufactured or sold. These laws, regulations and interpretations thereof may change, sometimes dramatically, as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. Such factors may include changes in:\n\u2022\nfood and drug laws (including FDA regulations);\n\u2022\nlaws related to product labeling;\n\u2022\nadvertising and marketing laws and practices;\n\u2022\nlaws and programs restricting the sale and advertising of certain of our products;\n\u2022\nlaws and programs aimed at reducing, restricting or eliminating ingredients present in certain of our products;\n\u2022\nlaws and programs aimed at discouraging the consumption of products or ingredients or altering the package or portion size of certain of our products;\n\u2022\nstate consumer protection and disclosure laws;\n\u2022\ntaxation requirements, including the imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes or other limitations on the sale of our products; competition laws;\n\u2022\nanti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), and the UK Bribery Act of 2010 (the \u201cBribery Act\u201d);\n\u2022\neconomic sanctions and anti-boycott laws, including laws administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) and the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d);\n\u2022\nlaws relating to export, re-export, transfer, tariffs and import controls, including the Export Administration Regulations, the EU Dual Use Regulation and the customs and import laws administered by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection;\n\u2022\nemployment laws;\n\u2022\nprivacy laws;\n\u2022\nlaws regulating the price we may charge for our products; and\n\u2022\nfarming and environmental laws.\nNew laws, regulations or governmental policies and their related interpretations, or changes in any of the foregoing, including taxes, tariffs or other limitations on the sale of our products, ingredients contained in our products or commodities used in the production of our products, may alter the environment in which we do business and, therefore, may affect our operating results or increase our costs or liabilities. In addition, if we fail to adhere to such laws and regulations, we could be subject to regulatory investigations, civil or criminal sanctions, as well as class action litigation, which has increased in the industry in recent years.\nOur geographic focus makes us particularly vulnerable to economic and other events and trends in North America.\nWe operate mainly in North America and, therefore, are particularly susceptible to adverse regulations, economic climate, consumer trends, market fluctuations, including commodity price fluctuations or supply shortages of key ingredients, and other adverse events in North America, including the U.S. and Canada. The concentration of our businesses in North America could present challenges and may increase the likelihood that an adverse event in North America would disproportionately materially and adversely affect product sales, financial condition and operating results.\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and have a negative effect on our reputation.\nFrom time to time, we may be party to various claims and litigation proceedings. We evaluate these claims and litigation proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, potential losses. We may establish reserves, as appropriate based on the information available to management at the time. These assessments and estimates involve a significant amount of management judgment and may differ materially from actual outcomes.\nThere is an additional risk that potential litigation may lead to adverse publicity, consumer confusion, distrust and additional legal challenges for us. Should we become subject to related or additional unforeseen lawsuits, including claims related to our products, labeling or advertising, which may vary in accordance with state and federal rules and regulations, consumers may avoid purchasing our products or seek alternative products, even if the basis for the claims against us is unfounded.\nAny consumer loss of confidence in the truthfulness of our labeling or ingredient claims would be difficult and costly to overcome and may significantly reduce our brand value. For example, publications and other third-party commentary may vary in opinion with respect to calculations of net carbs and vary on approach to calculations of net carbs, which may lead to reports questioning the accuracy of our calculations and reporting the amount of net carbs contained in certain of our products. Uncertainty among consumers as to the nutritional content or the ingredients used in our products, regardless of the cause, may have an adverse effect on our brands, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part upon protection of our rights in trademarks, trade dress, copyrights and other intellectual property rights we own or license. Our use of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and trademark, copyright, unfair competition, trade secret and other laws to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights may not be adequate. We may not be able to preclude third parties from using our intellectual property with respect to food or beverage products, and may not be able to leverage our branding beyond our current product offerings. In addition, our trademark or other intellectual property applications may not always be granted. Third parties may oppose our intellectual property applications, or otherwise challenge our use of trademarks or other intellectual property. Third parties may infringe, misappropriate, or otherwise violate our intellectual property. Changes in applicable laws could serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections available for intellectual property. Any legal action that we may bring to protect our brand and other intellectual property could be unsuccessful, result is substantial costs and could divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. A successful claim of trademark, copyright or other intellectual property infringement, misappropriation, or other violation against us could prevent us from providing our products or services, or could require us to redesign or rebrand our products or packaging if we are unable to license such third-party intellectual property on reasonable terms. Certain of our intellectual property licenses have fixed terms, and even for those that do not, we cannot guarantee that all of our intellectual property licenses will remain in effect indefinitely. Termination of intellectual property licenses granted by or to us could result in the loss of profits generated pursuant to such licenses. Any of the foregoing outcomes could materially and adversely harm our business, financial condition or results of our operations.\nAny inadequacy, failure or interruption of our information technology systems may harm our ability to effectively operate our business, and our business is subject to online security risks, including security breaches and identity theft.\nWe are dependent on various information technology systems. A failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business. Our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security\nissues. Despite safeguards that we have implemented that are designed to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology systems, we cannot be certain that our information technology systems are free from vulnerability to security breaches (especially as the sophistication of cyber-security threats continues to increase), or from vulnerability to inadvertent disclosures of sensitive data by third parties or by us.\nUnauthorized users who penetrate our information security systems could misappropriate proprietary, employee, or consumer information. As a result, it may become necessary to expend additional amounts of capital and resources to protect against, or to alleviate, problems caused by unauthorized access. Data security breaches could result in damaged reputation with consumers and reduced demand for our products. Additional expenditures may not prove to be a timely remedy against breaches by unauthorized users who are able to penetrate our information security. In addition to purposeful security breaches, the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could adversely affect our computer systems and, in turn, harm our business.\nA significant number of states require that consumers be notified if a security breach results in the disclosure of their personal financial account or other information. Additional states and governmental entities are considering such \u201cnotice\u201d laws. In addition, other public disclosure laws may require that material security breaches be reported. If we experience a security breach, and such notice or public disclosure is required in the future, our reputation and our business may be harmed.\nWith the exception of limited information voluntarily submitted by users of our website, we typically do not collect or store consumer data or personal information. However, third-party providers, including our licensees, contract manufacturers, e-commerce contractors and third-party sellers may do so. The website operations of such third parties may be affected by reliance on other third-party hardware and software providers, technology changes, risks related to the failure of computer systems through which these website operations are conducted, telecommunications failures, data security breaches and similar disruptions. If we or our third-party providers fail to maintain or protect our respective information technology systems and data integrity effectively, fail to implement new systems, and/or update or expand existing systems or fail to anticipate, plan for or manage significant disruptions to systems involved in our operations, we could lose existing customers, have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, suppliers, distributors or others, and be subject to regulatory sanctions, including sanctions stemming from violations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and as a result, have increases in operating expenses.\nIf we are unable to implement appropriate systems, procedures and controls, we may not be able to successfully offer our products, grow our business and account for transactions in an appropriate and timely manner.\nOur ability to successfully offer our products, grow our business and account for transactions in an appropriate and timely manner requires an effective planning and management process and certain other automated management and accounting systems. We currently do not have an integrated enterprise resource planning system and certain other automated management and accounting systems. We periodically update our operations and financial systems, procedures and controls; however; we still rely on manual processes and procedures that may not scale proportionately with our business growth. Our systems will continue to require automation, modifications and improvements to respond to current and future changes in our business. Failure to implement in a timely manner appropriate internal systems, procedures and controls could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims.\nWe believe that we maintain insurance customary for businesses of our size and type. However, there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure. Such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLoss of our key executive officers or other personnel, or an inability to attract and retain such management and other personnel, could negatively affect our business.\nOur future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our key executive officers. The loss of the services of any of these executives could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects, as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace them on a timely basis, if at all. Additionally, we also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business. If we fail to attract talented new employees, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nWe may need additional capital in the future, and it may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe have historically relied upon cash generated by our operations to fund our operations and strategy. We may also need to access the debt and equity capital markets, however, these sources of financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Our ability to obtain additional financing will be subject to a number of factors, including market conditions, our operating performance, investor sentiment and our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with agreements governing our outstanding debt. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms or conditions of additional financing unattractive to us. If we are unable to generate sufficient funds from operations or raise additional capital, our growth could be impeded.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significantly increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management has been and will continue to be required to devote substantial time to compliance efforts.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses as a result of being a public company. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Customer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), as well as related rules implemented by the SEC, have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies. In addition, rules that the SEC is implementing or is required to implement pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act are expected to require additional changes. Compliance with these and other similar laws, rules and regulations, including compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSection 404\u201d), has and will continue to substantially increase expense, including our legal and accounting costs, and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. Our internal infrastructure may not be adequate to support our increased reporting obligations, and we may be unable to hire, train or retain necessary staff and may be reliant on engaging outside consultants or professionals to overcome our limited experience or employees which could adversely affect our business if our internal infrastructure is inadequate to fulfill our public company obligations. These laws, rules and regulations could also make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as our executive officers.\nIf we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we could fail to report our financial results accurately.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports. In the future, we may discover areas of our internal control over financial reporting that need improvement. Prior to the Business Combination, we had not historically documented our internal controls. If we identify a control deficiency that rises to the level of a material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information timely and accurately may be adversely affected and, as a result, our financial statements may contain material misstatements or omissions. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In addition, our internal financial and accounting team is leanly staffed, which can lead to inefficiencies with respect to segregation of duties. If we fail to properly and efficiently maintain an effective internal control over financial reporting, we could fail to report our financial results accurately.\nOur only significant asset is ownership of 100% of Atkins Intermediate Holdings, LLC and such ownership may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to enable us to pay any dividends on our common stock or satisfy our other financial obligations.\nWe have no direct operations and no significant assets other than the direct ownership of 100% of Atkins Intermediate Holdings, LLC. We currently depend on Atkins Intermediate Holdings, LLC for distributions, loans and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations and to pay any dividends with respect to our common stock. Legal and contractual restrictions in agreements governing our debt arrangements and future indebtedness of Atkins Intermediate Holdings, LLC, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of Atkins Intermediate Holdings, LLC, may limit our ability to obtain funds in a timely manner from Atkins Intermediate Holdings, LLC. The earnings from, or other available assets of, Atkins Intermediate Holdings, LLC may not be sufficient to pay dividends, make distributions or loans to enable us to pay any dividends on our common stock, or satisfy our other financial obligations.\nOur international operations expose us to regulatory, economic, political and social risks in the countries in which we operate.\nThe international nature of our operations involves a number of risks, including changes in U.S. and foreign regulations, tariffs, taxes and exchange controls, economic downturns, inflation and political and social instability in the countries in which we operate and our dependence on foreign personnel. Moreover, although our products in our foreign operations typically mirror those in the United States, consumers outside the United States may have different tastes, preferences and nutritional approaches than U.S. consumers. Our international business is small in comparison to our U.S. business, and as a result, our operations are more spread out which can add to our costs and limit our ability to effectively and timely react to adverse events. We cannot be certain that we will be able to enter and successfully compete in additional foreign markets or that we will be able to continue to compete in the foreign markets in which we currently operate.\nDoing business outside the United States requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions, which place restrictions on our operations, trade practices, partners and investment decisions. In particular, our operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and trade control laws and regulations, such as the FCPA or the Bribery Act, export controls and economic sanctions programs, including those administered by the OFAC and the EU. As a result of doing business in foreign countries and with foreign partners, we are exposed to a heightened risk of violating anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations. The FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage. In addition, the Bribery Act extends beyond bribery of foreign public officials and also applies to transactions with private persons. The provisions of the Bribery Act are also more onerous than the FCPA in a number of other respects, including jurisdictional reach, non-exemption of facilitation payments and, potentially, penalties.\nOur continued expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, and our development of new partnerships and joint venture relationships worldwide, could increase the risk of FCPA, OFAC, Bribery Act or EU sanctions violations in the future. Violations of anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations may cause reputational damage and are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment.\nFinally, our business could be negatively affected by changes in the U.S. and Canadian political environments, in particular. We operate primarily in the U.S. and Canada and we ship a large number of products between the U.S. and Canada. Adverse changes to trade agreements, import or export regulations, customs duties or tariffs by either or both governments may have a negative effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nOur international operations expose us to fluctuations in exchange rates, which may materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe source large quantities of our core ingredients from foreign suppliers, and as a result, any material upward movement in foreign exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar will adversely affect our profitability. Furthermore, the substantial majority of our revenue is generated domestically, while a substantial portion of our third party manufacturing is completed in Canada. Any U.S. dollar weakness may therefore materially and adversely affect revenue and cash flows while also increasing supply and manufacturing costs.\nRisks Related to the Company's Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d). The market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and could fluctuate substantially in the future, based on a variety of factors, including future announcements covering us or our key customers or competitors, government regulations, litigation, changes in earnings estimates by analysts, fluctuations in quarterly operating results or general conditions in our industry and may be exacerbated by the fact that there has historically been limited trading volume in our common stock. Furthermore, stock prices for many companies fluctuate widely for reasons that may be unrelated to their operating results. Those fluctuations and general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions or international currency fluctuations and demand for our services, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors may need to rely on sales of their shares of common stock after the price has appreciated, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, to the extent allowed by law, the doctrine of \u201ccorporate opportunity\u201d does not apply with respect to the directors, officers, employees or representatives of Conyers Park Sponsor, LLC (\u201cConyers Park Sponsor\u201d) Centerview Capital Holdings LLC (\u201cCenterview Capital\u201d) and Centerview Partners and their respective affiliates, excepted as provided below.\nThe doctrine of corporate opportunity generally provides that a corporate fiduciary may not develop an opportunity using corporate resources, acquire an interest adverse to that of the corporation or acquire property that is reasonably incident to the present or prospective business of the corporation or in which the corporation has a present or expectancy interest, unless that opportunity is first presented to the corporation and the corporation chooses not to pursue that opportunity. The doctrine of corporate opportunity is intended to preclude officers, directors or other fiduciaries from personally benefiting from opportunities that belong to the corporation. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, to the extent allowed by law, the doctrine of \u201ccorporate opportunity\u201d does not apply with respect to the directors, officers, employees or representatives of Conyers Park Sponsor, Centerview Capital and Centerview Partners and their respective affiliates. The doctrine of corporate opportunity shall apply with respect to any of our directors or officers with respect to a corporate opportunity that was offered in writing to such person solely in his or her capacity as our director or officer and such opportunity is one which they are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. Therefore, except as provided above, these parties have no duty to communicate or present corporate opportunities to us, and have the right to either hold any corporate opportunity for their (and their affiliates\u2019) own account and benefit or to recommend, assign or otherwise transfer such corporate opportunity to persons other than us.\nAs a result, certain of our stockholders, directors and their respective affiliates are not prohibited from operating or investing in competing businesses. We therefore may find ourselves in competition with certain of our stockholders, directors or their respective affiliates, and we may not have knowledge of, or be able to pursue, transactions that could potentially be beneficial to us. Accordingly, we may lose a corporate opportunity or suffer competitive harm, which could negatively affect our business or prospects.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business, or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely, the price and trading volume of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. Securities and industry analysts may not publish or may cease publishing research on us. If securities or industry analysts cease coverage, our stock price and trading volume may be negatively affected. If any of the analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our common stock may decline. If any analysts were to cease coverage, or fail to regularly publish reports on our business, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThere may be future sales or other dilution of the Company's equity, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are not generally restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock, or any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of common stock. The issuance of any additional shares of common stock or preferred shares or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or that represent the right to receive shares of common stock or the exercise of such securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of our common stock. Additionally, 6,700,000 warrants to purchase our common stock on a one-for-one basis for an exercise price of $11.50 per share are outstanding. To the extent such warrants are exercised, additional shares of our common stock will be issued, which will result in dilution to our existing stockholders and increase the number of shares eligible for resale in the public market. Sales of substantial numbers of such shares in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of our common stock made in the future or the perception that such sales could occur. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of future offerings, if any. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their holdings in the Company.\nThe Company's board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with rights and preferences superior to those applicable to our common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation includes a provision for the issuance of preferred stock, which may be issued in one or more series, with each series containing such rights and preferences as the board of directors may determine from time to time, without prior notice to or approval of stockholders. Among others, such rights and preferences might include the rights to dividends, liquidation preferences and rights to convert into common stock. The rights and preferences of any such series of preferred stock, if issued, may be superior to the rights and preferences applicable to the common stock and might result in a decrease in the price of our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and second amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na staggered board providing for three classes of directors, which limits the ability of a stockholder or group to gain control of our board;\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director in certain circumstances, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to determine whether to issue shares of our preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholders calling a special meeting, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual of our stockholders or at a special meeting of our stockholders called by the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer of the board of directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a meeting of stockholders may be called only by the board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nproviding that directors may be removed prior to the expiration of their terms by stockholders only for cause and upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of the combined company;\n\u2022\na requirement that changes or amends the amended and restated certificate of incorporation or the second amended and restated bylaws must be approved by at least 66\u2154% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.\nRisks Related to the Acquisition\nIf we fail to complete the Acquisition, we will not recognize the benefits we describe in this Report.\nAlthough we have entered into the Purchase Agreement with respect to the Acquisition of Quest and its affiliated companies, we cannot guarantee when, or whether the Acquisition will be completed. The closing of the Acquisition is subject to customary conditions, and the Acquisition may not be completed as contemplated, or at all. If we are unable to complete the Acquisition, we will not realize many of the Acquisition benefits that are described in this Report, and the value of our common stock could be impaired.\nWe may not realize the expected benefits of the Acquisition because of integration difficulties and other challenges.\nThe success of the Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize all or some of the anticipated benefits from integrating Quest's business with our existing businesses. The integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming. The difficulties of integrating the operations of Quest's business include, among others:\n\u2022\nfailure to implement our business plan for the combined business;\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues in integrating co-manufacturing, logistics, information, communications and other systems;\n\u2022\npossible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, and compensation structures between Quest's structure and our structure;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain key customers and suppliers;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nfailure to retain key employees, and the complexities associated with integrating personnel from another company;\n\u2022\noperating risks inherent in Quest's business and our business;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nincreasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations; and\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities.\nWe may not be able to maintain the levels of revenue, earnings or operating efficiency that each of Simply Good Foods and Quest had achieved or might achieve separately. In addition, we may not accomplish the integration of Quest's business smoothly, successfully or within the anticipated costs or timeframe. If we experience difficulties with the integration process, the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nWe face risks associated with the Purchase Agreement in connection with the Acquisition.\nIn connection with the Acquisition, we will be subject to substantially all the liabilities of Quest that are not satisfied on or prior to the closing date. There may be liabilities that we underestimated or did not discover in the course of performing our due diligence investigation of Quest. Under the Purchase Agreement, the sellers have agreed to provide us with a limited set of representations and warranties. Our sole remedy from the sellers for any breach of those representations and warranties is an action for indemnification. Damages resulting from a breach of a representation or warranty could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a private company, Quest may not have in place an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting that we will need to manage that business effectively as part of a public company.\nNone of Quest and its affiliated companies have previously been subject to periodic reporting as a public company. There can be no assurance that Quest has in place a system of internal control over financial reporting that is required for public companies, and that will be required of us with respect to Quest when the Acquisition is completed. Establishing, testing and maintaining an effective system of internal control over financial reporting requires significant resources and time commitments on the part of our management and our finance and accounting staff, may require additional staffing and infrastructure investments, and would increase our costs of doing business. Moreover, if we discover aspects of Quest's internal controls that need improvement, we cannot be certain that our remedial measures will be effective. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or increase our risk of material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting.\nWe will incur substantial indebtedness in order to finance the Acquisition, which could adversely affect our business and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business.\nIn connection with the Acquisition, we have debt commitments with certain lenders. These debt commitments are subject to certain conditions, and we cannot assure you that those conditions will be satisfied. Upon consummation of the Acquisition, we will have substantially more indebtedness than has been the case for us historically. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash from our future operations. This, to a certain extent, is subject to financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, if we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy, prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business and/or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to refinance our indebtedness or take such other actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We cannot guarantee the lenders will provide sufficient financing under the debt commitments to finance the Acquisition.\nIn connection with the Acquisition, we have debt commitments with certain lenders. These debt commitments are subject to certain conditions and we cannot assure you that those conditions will be satisfied. There can also be no assurance that sufficient financing will be available at the time of the closing of the Acquisition, or that the lender counterparties in any such commitments will honor their contractual commitments. If we need additional capital and cannot raise it on acceptable terms, or at all, we may not be able to complete the Acquisition.\nWe will incur significant transaction and acquisition-related costs in connection with the Acquisition, whether or not it is completed.\nWe have already incurred significant costs, and expect to incur significant additional costs associated with the Acquisition. The substantial majority of these costs will be non-recurring transaction expenses and costs. These non-recurring costs and expenses are not reflected in the financial information included in this Report. These costs will reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for the payment of our debt and other corporate purposes.", "PERMNO": 16284, "SIC": 2060, "TIC": "SMPL"}
