RISK FACTORS\nAny of the following risks could harm our business, results of\noperations and financial condition and an investment in our\nstock.\nThe risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements,\nand our actual results may differ substantially\nfrom those discussed in these forward-looking statements.\nOperational Risks\nMarket conditions and economic cyclicality may adversely affect\nour industry.\nWe believe the following,\namong other things, may affect us in 2021:\n\u25cf\nThe COVID-19 pandemic disrupted\nthe economy beginning late in the first quarter of 2020, and continues.\nAuburn University, government\nagencies and businesses were limited to remote work and gatherings\nwere limited.\nSupply chains continue to be disrupted and unemployment spiked\nand remains high.\nHotels, motels, restaurants,\nretail and shopping centers were especially affected.\n\u25cf\nExtraordinary monetary and fiscal stimulus in 2020 and in early\n2021 have offset certain of the pandemic\u2019s\nadverse economic effects, and are continuing.\nThe Federal Reserve is maintaining a targeted\nfederal funds rate of\n0-0.25%, and has provided stimulus by buying bonds and providing\nmarket liquidity.\nLegislation is pending to\nprovide an additional $1.9 trillion of fiscal stimulus, and foreclosure\nmoratoria have been extended.\nThe nature\nand timing of any future changes in monetary and fiscal policies and\ntheir effect on us cannot be predicted.\n\u25cf\nMarket developments, including unemployment, price levels,\nstock and bond market volatility,\nand changes,\nincluding those resulting from COVID-19 and the pace of vaccination\nand expected declines in serious COVID-19\ncases, continue to affect consumer confidence levels and\neconomic activity.\nChanges in payment behaviors and\npayment rates may increase in delinquencies and default rates,\nwhich could affect our earnings and credit quality.\n\u25cf\nOur ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers and\nthose we do business with, and the values of our\nassets and loan collateral may be adversely affected and less\npredictable as a result of the pandemic and\ngovernment responses.\nThe accounting for loan modifications and deferrals may provide\nonly temporary relief.\nThe process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure\nor estimate the value of certain assets\nrequires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, including\nforecasts of economic conditions and how those\neconomic predictions might affect the ability of our borrowers\nto repay their loans or the value of assets.\n\u25cf\nThe end of the LIBOR reference rate is currently scheduled for\nmost tenors by June 30, 2023, although U.S. bank\nregulators informed banks November 30, 2020 that they should\nstop using LIBOR for new loans and contracts and\nderivatives, including hedging, and involves risks of potential marked\ndisruption and costs of compliance and\nconversion.\nNew hedges may not be as effective as hedges based\non LIBOR.\nNonperforming and similar assets take significant time to resolve\nand may adversely affect our results of\noperations and\nfinancial condition.\nOur nonperforming loans were 0.12% of total loans as of December\n31, 2020, and had no other real estate owned\n(\u201cOREO\u201d).\nTwenty-five percent, or\n$117.0 million, of our total loans were in hotels/motels,\nretail and shopping centers\nand restaurants, and $31.4 million of these had COVID-19 modifications\nto require interest only payments.\nNon-\nperforming assets may adversely affect our net income\nin various ways.\nWe do\nnot record interest income on nonaccrual\nloans or OREO and these assets require higher loan administration\nand other costs, thereby adversely affecting our income.\nDecreases in the value of these assets, or the underlying collateral,\nor in the related borrowers\u2019 performance or financial\ncondition, whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond\nour control, could adversely affect our business,\nresults of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the resolution of nonperforming assets requires commitments\nof\ntime from management, which can be detrimental to the performance\nof their other responsibilities. Our non-performing\nassets may be adversely affected by loan deferrals and\nmodifications made in response to the pandemic and the moratoria\non foreclosures and evictions.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not experience increases in\nnonperforming loans in\nthe future.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove\ninadequate or we may be negatively affected by credit\nrisk exposures.\nWe periodically\nreview our allowance for loan losses for adequacy considering economic\nconditions and trends, collateral\nvalues and credit quality indicators, including past charge\n-off experience and levels of past due loans and nonperforming\nassets.\nWe cannot\nbe certain that our allowance for loan losses will be adequate\nover time to cover credit losses in our\nportfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy,\nincluding the continuing effects of the pandemic\nand\nfiscal and monetary response to COVID-19 loan modifications\nand deferrals, market conditions or events adversely\naffecting specific customers, industries or markets,\nand changes in borrower behaviors.\nCertain borrowers may not recover\nfully or may fail as a result of COVID-19 effects.\nIf the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases,\nif the risk\nprofile of the market, industry or group of customers changes\nmaterially or weaknesses in the real estate markets worsen,\nborrower payment behaviors change, or if our allowance for loan\nlosses is not adequate, our business, financial condition,\nincluding our liquidity and capital, and results of operations\ncould be materially adversely affected.\nCECL, a new\naccounting standard for estimating loan losses, is effective for\nthe Company beginning January 1, 2023, and its effects upon\nthe Company have not yet been determined.\nChanges in the real estate markets, including\nthe secondary market for residential mortgage\nloans, may continue to\nadversely affect us.\nThe CFPB\u2019s mortgage and servicing\nrules, including TRID rules for closed end credit transactions,\nenforcement actions,\nreviews and settlements, affect the mortgage markets and\nour mortgage operations.\nThe CFPB requires that lenders\ndetermine whether a consumer has the ability to repay a mortgage loan\nhave limited the secondary market for and liquidity\nof many mortgage loans that are not \u201cqualified mortgages.\u201d\nRecently adopted changes to the CFPB\u2019s\nqualified mortgage\nrules are reportedly being reconsidered.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct\u2019s (the \u201c2017 Tax\nAct\u201d) limitations on the deductibility of residential mortgage interest\nand state\nand local property and other taxes and federal moratoria\non single-family foreclosures and rental evictions could adversely\naffect consumer behaviors and the volumes of housing sales,\nmortgage and home equity loan originations, as well as the\nvalue and liquidity of residential property held as collateral by lenders\nsuch as the Bank, and the secondary markets for\nsingle and multi-family loans.\nAcquisition, construction and development loans for residential development\nmay be\nsimilarly adversely affected.\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac (\u201cGSEs\u201d), have been in conservatorship\nsince September 2008.\nSince Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac dominate the residential mortgage markets, any\nchanges in their operations and requirements, as well as their\nrespective restructurings and capital, could adversely affect\nthe primary and secondary mortgage markets, and our\nresidential mortgage businesses, our results of operations and\nthe returns on capital deployed in these businesses.\nThe\ntiming and effects of resolution of these government sponsored\nenterprises cannot be predicted.\nWeaknesses in real\nestate markets the FHFA\u2019s\nmoratoria on foreclosures and real estate owned evictions may adversely\naffect the length of time and costs required to\nmanage and dispose of, and the values realized from the sale\nof our OREO.\nWe may be\ncontractually obligated to repurchase\nmortgage loans we sold to third parties on terms unfavorable\nto us.\nAs part of its routine business, the Company originates mortgage loans\nthat it subsequently sells in the secondary market,\nincluding to governmental agencies and GSEs.\nIn connection with the sale of these loans, the Company makes customary\nrepresentations and warranties, the breach of which may result in\nthe Company being required to repurchase the loan or\nloans.\nFurthermore, the amount paid may be greater than the fair value of the\nloan or loans at the time of the repurchase.\nAlthough mortgage loan repurchase requests made to us have been\nlimited, if these increased, we may have to establish\nreserves for possible repurchases and adversely affect our results of operation\nand financial condition.\nMortgage servicing rights requirements\nmay change and require\nus to incur additional costs and risks.\nThe CFPB\u2019s residential mortgage\nservicing standards may adversely affect our costs to\nservice residential mortgage loans,\nand together with the Basel III Rules and the effects of\nlower interest rates from COVID-19 stimulus, may decrease the\nreturns on, and values of, our MSRs.\nThis could reduce our income from servicing these types\nof loans and make it more\ndifficult and costly to timely realize the value of collateral\nsecuring such loans upon a borrower default.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect\nus.\nWe routinely execute\ntransactions with counterparties in the financial services industry,\nincluding brokers and dealers,\ncentral clearinghouses, banks, including our correspondent banks\nand other financial institutions.\nOur ability to engage in\nroutine investment and banking transactions, as well as the quality and\nvalues of our investments in holdings of other\nobligations of other financial institutions such as the FHLB, could\nbe adversely affected by the actions, financial condition,\nand profitability of such other financial institutions, including\nthe FHLB and our correspondent banks.\nFinancial services\ninstitutions are interrelated as a result of shared credits, trading, clearing,\ncounterparty and other relationships.\nAny losses,\ndefaults by, or failures of, the\ninstitutions we do business with could adversely affect our\nholdings of the equity in such\nother institutions, our participation interests in loans originated\nby other institutions,\nand our business, including our\nliquidity, financial condition and\nearnings.\nOur concentration of commercial real\nestate loans could result in further increased\nloan losses, and adversely affect our\nbusiness, earnings, and financial condition.\nCommercial real estate, or CRE, is cyclical and poses risks of possible\nloss due to concentration levels and risks of the\nassets being financed, which include loans for the acquisition and development\nof land and residential construction.\nThe\nfederal bank regulatory\nagencies released guidance in 2006 on \u201cConcentrations\nin Commercial Real Estate Lending.\u201d\nThe\nguidance defines CRE loans as exposures secured by raw land,\nland development and construction loans (including 1-4\nfamily residential construction loans), multi-family property,\nand non-farm non-residential property,\nwhere the primary or a\nsignificant source of repayment is derived from rental income associated\nwith the property (that is, loans for which 50% or\nmore of the source of repayment comes from third party,\nnon-affiliated, rental income) or the proceeds\nof the sale,\nrefinancing, or permanent financing of the property.\nLoans to REITs\nand unsecured loans to developers that closely\ncorrelate to the inherent risks in CRE markets are also CRE loans.\nLoans on owner occupied commercial real estate are\ngenerally excluded from CRE for purposes of this guidance.\nExcluding owner occupied commercial real estate, we had\n43.6%\nof our portfolio in CRE loans at year-end 2020 compared\nto 48.0% at year-end 2019.\nThe banking regulators\ncontinue to give CRE lending scrutiny and require banks with\nhigher levels of CRE loans to implement improved\nunderwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and\nportfolio stress testing, as well as higher levels of allowances\nfor possible losses and capital levels as a result of CRE lending growth\nand exposures.\nLower demand for CRE, and\nreduced availability of, and higher interest rates and costs for,\nCRE lending could adversely affect our CRE loans and sales\nof our OREO, and therefore our earnings and financial condition,\nincluding our capital and liquidity.\nAt year-end 2020, 25% of our total loans were CRE\nloans to hotels/motels, retail and shopping centers and restaurants,\nbusinesses that have been severely affected by the effects\nof COVID-19.\nOur future success is dependent on\nour ability to compete effectively in highly competitive markets.\nThe East Alabama banking markets which we operate\nare highly competitive and our future growth and success will\ndepend on our ability to compete effectively in these markets.\nWe compete for loans,\ndeposits and other financial services\nwith other local, regional and national commercial banks, thrifts, credit\nunions, mortgage lenders, and securities and\ninsurance brokerage firms.\nLenders operating nationwide over the internet are growing rapidly.\nMany of our competitors\noffer products and services different from\nus, and have substantially greater resources, name recognition and\nmarket\npresence than we do, which benefits them in attracting business.\nIn addition, larger competitors may be able to\nprice loans\nand deposits more aggressively than we are able to and have broader\nand more diverse customer and geographic bases to\ndraw upon.\nOut of state banks may branch into our markets.\nFailures of other banks with offices in our markets could\nalso\nlead to the entrance of new,\nstronger competitors in our markets.\nOur success depends on local economic conditions.\nOur success depends on the general economic conditions in the\ngeographic markets we serve in Alabama.\nThe local\neconomic conditions in our markets have a significant effect\non our commercial, real estate and construction loans, the\nability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral\nsecuring these loans.\nAdverse changes in the\neconomic conditions of the Southeastern United States in general,\nor in one or more of our local markets, including the\ncontinuous effects from COVID-19 and the timing,\nstrength and breadth of the recovery from the pandemic,\ncould\nnegatively affect our results of operations and our\nprofitability.\nOur local economy is also affected by the growth of\nautomobile manufacturing and related suppliers located in our\nmarkets and nearby.\nAuto sales are cyclical and are affected\nadversely by higher interest rates.\nAttractive acquisition opportunities may not be available\nto us in the future.\nWhile we seek continued organic growth, we also may\nconsider the acquisition of other businesses.\nWe expect that other\nbanking and financial companies, many of which have significantly\ngreater resources, will compete with us to acquire\nfinancial services businesses.\nThis competition could increase prices for potential acquisitions that\nwe believe are\nattractive.\nAlso, acquisitions are subject to various regulatory approvals.\nIf we fail to receive the appropriate regulatory\napprovals, we will not be able to consummate an acquisition that\nwe believe is in our best interests, and regulatory\napprovals could contain conditions that reduce the anticipated\nbenefits of any transaction.\nAmong other things, our\nregulators consider our capital, liquidity,\nprofitability, regulatory compliance\nand levels of goodwill and intangibles when\nconsidering acquisition and expansion proposals.\nAny acquisition could be dilutive to our earnings and shareholders\u2019\nequity per share of our common stock.\nFuture acquisitions and expansion activities\nmay disrupt our business, dilute shareholder\nvalue and adversely affect our\noperating results.\nWe regularly evaluate\npotential acquisitions and expansion opportunities, including new\nbranches and other offices.\nTo the\nextent that we grow through acquisitions, we cannot assure you that\nwe will be able to adequately or profitably manage this\ngrowth.\nAcquiring other banks, branches, or businesses, as well as other geographic\nand product expansion activities,\ninvolve various risks including:\n\u25cf\nrisks of unknown or contingent liabilities, and potential asset quality issues;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated costs and delays;\n\u25cf\nrisks that acquired new businesses will not perform consistent with\nour growth and profitability expectations;\n\u25cf\nrisks of entering new markets or product areas where we have\nlimited experience;\n\u25cf\nrisks that growth will strain our infrastructure, staff, internal\ncontrols and management, which may require\nadditional personnel, time and expenditures;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties, expenses and delays of integrating the operations\nand personnel of acquired institutions;\n\u25cf\npotential disruptions to our business;\n\u25cf\npossible loss of key employees and customers of acquired institutions;\n\u25cf\npotential short-term decreases in profitability; and\n\u25cf\ndiversion of our management\u2019s\ntime and attention from our existing operations and business.\nTechnological\nchanges affect our business, and we may have fewer resources\nthan many competitors to invest in\ntechnological improvements.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid\ntechnological changes with frequent introductions of new technology\ndriven products and services and growing demands for mobile\nand user-based banking applications. In addition to allowing\nus to analyze our customers better,\nthe effective use of technology may increase efficiency\nand may enable financial\ninstitutions to reduce costs, risks associated with fraud and\ncompliance with anti-money laundering and other laws, and\nvarious operational risks. Largely unregulated \u201cfintech\u201d businesses\nhave increased their participation in the lending and\npayments businesses, and have increased competition in these\nbusinesses. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our\nability to use technology to provide products and services that\nmeet our customers\u2019 preferences and create additional\nefficiencies in operations, while avoiding cyber-attacks\nand disruptions, and data breaches. The COVID-19 pandemic\nand\nincreased remote work has accelerated electronic banking activity\nand the need for increased operational efficiencies.\nWe\nmay need to make significant additional capital investments in technology,\nincluding cyber and data security,\nand we may\nnot be able to effectively implement new technology\n-driven products and services, or such technology may prove less\neffective than anticipated. Many larger competito\nrs have substantially greater resources to invest in technological\nimprovements and, increasingly,\nnon-banking firms are using technology to compete with traditional\nlenders for loans and\nother banking services.\nOperational risks are inherent\nin our businesses.\nOperational risks and losses can result from internal and external\nfraud; gaps or weaknesses in our risk management or\ninternal audit procedures; errors by employees or third parties,\nincluding our vendors, failures to document transactions\nproperly or obtain proper authorizations; failure to comply with applicable\nregulatory requirements in the various\njurisdictions where we do business or have customers; failures in our\nestimates models that rely on; equipment failures,\nincluding those caused by natural disasters, or by electrical, telecommunications\nor other essential utility outages; business\ncontinuity and data security system failures, including those caused by\ncomputer viruses, cyberattacks, unforeseen\nproblems encountered while implementing major new computer\nsystems or, failures to timely and properly\nupgrade and\npatch existing systems or inadequate access to data or\npoor response capabilities in light of such business continuity and\ndata security system failures; or the inadequacy or failure of\nsystems and controls, including those of our vendors or\ncounterparties.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has presented operational challenges\nto maintaining continuity of operations of\ncustomer services while protecting our employees\u2019 and customers\u2019\nsafety.\nIn addition, we face certain risks inherent in the\nownership and operation of our bank premises and other real\n-estate, including liability for accidents on our properties.\nAlthough we have implemented risk controls and loss mitigation actions,\nand substantial resources are devoted to\ndeveloping efficient procedures, identifying and rectifying\nweaknesses in existing procedures and training staff,\nit is not\npossible to be certain that such actions have been or will be\neffective in controlling these various operational risks\nthat\nevolve continuously.\nPotential gaps in our risk management policies and internal\naudit procedures\nmay leave us exposed unidentified or\nunanticipated risk, which could negatively affect our business.\nOur enterprise risk management and internal audit program is\ndesigned to mitigate material risks and loss to us. We\nhave\ndeveloped and continue to develop risk management and internal\naudit policies and procedures to reflect the ongoing\nreview of our risks and expect to continue to do so in the future.\nNonetheless, our policies and procedures may not be\ncomprehensive and may not identify timely every risk to which we\nare exposed, and our internal audit process may fail to\ndetect such weaknesses or deficiencies in our risk management\nframework. Many of our risk management models and\nestimates use observed historical market behavior to model\nor project potential future exposure.\nModels used by our\nbusiness are based on assumptions and projections. These\nmodels may not operate properly or our inputs and assumptions\nmay be inaccurate, or changes in economic conditions, customer\nbehaviors or regulations.\nAs a result, these methods may\nnot fully predict future exposures, which can be significantly\ngreater than historically.\nOther risk management methods\ndepend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets,\nclients, or other matters that are publicly available or\notherwise accessible to us. This information may not always\nbe accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated.\nFurthermore, there can be no assurance that we can effectively\nreview and monitor all risks or that all of our employees will\nclosely follow our risk management policies and procedures,\nnor can there be any assurance that our risk management\npolicies and procedures will enable us to accurately identify all\nrisks and limit our exposures based on our assessments. In\naddition, we may have to implement more extensive and perhaps\ndifferent risk management policies and procedu\nres as our\nregulation changes.\nAll of these could adversely affect our financial condition\nand results of operations.\nAny failure to protect\nthe confidentiality of customer information could adversely affect our\nreputation and have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations\n.\nVarious\nlaws enforced by the bank regulators and other agencies protect\nthe privacy and security of customers\u2019 non-public\npersonal information. Many of our employees have access to,\nand routinely process personal information of clients through\na variety of media, including information technology systems.\nOur internal processes and controls are designed to protect\nthe confidentiality of client information we hold and that is accessible\nto us and our employees. It is possible that an\nemployee could, intentionally or unintentionally,\ndisclose or misappropriate confidential client information or\nour data\ncould be the subject of a cybersecurity attack.\nSuch personal data could also be compromised via intrusions into\nour\nsystems or those of our service providers or persons we do business\nwith such as credit bureaus, data processors and\nmerchants who accept credit or debit cards for payment. If we\nfail to maintain adequate internal controls, or if our\nemployees fail to comply with our policies and procedures,\nmisappropriation or inappropriate disclosure or misuse of client\ninformation could occur. Such\ninternal control inadequacies or non-compliance could materially damage\nour reputation,\nlead to remediation costs and civil or criminal penalties.\nThese could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nOur information systems may experience interruptions and\nsecurity breaches.\nWe rely heavily on communications\nand information systems, including those provided\nby third-party service providers, to\nconduct our business.\nAny failure, interruption, or security breach of these systems could\nresult in failures or disruptions\nwhich could affect our customers\u2019 privacy and our\ncustomer relationships, generally.\nOur business continuity plans,\nincluding those of our service providers, to provide back-up and\nrestore service may not be effective in the case of\nwidespread outages due to severe weather,\nnatural disasters, pandemics, or power,\ncommunications and other failures.\nOur systems and networks, as well as those of our third-party service\nproviders, are subject to security risks and could be\nsusceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks,\nhacking, terrorist activities or identity theft.\nCybercrime risks\nhave increased as electronic and mobile banking activities increased\nas a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOther\nfinancial service institutions and their service providers have reported\nmaterial security breaches in their websites or other\nsystems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted\nattacks, including use of stolen access credentials,\nmalware, ransomware, phishing and distributed denial-of\n-service attacks, among other means.\nSuch cyber-attacks may also\nseek to disrupt the operations of public companies or their business\npartners, effect unauthorized fund transfers, obtain\nunauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data,\ndisable or degrade service, or sabotage systems.\nDenial of\nservice attacks have\nbeen launched against a number of financial services institutions,\nand we may be subject to these types\nof attacks in the future. Hacking and identity theft risks, in particular,\ncould cause serious reputational harm.\nDespite our cybersecurity policies and procedures and our\nBoard of Director\u2019s and Management\u2019s\nefforts to monitor and\nensure the integrity of the system we use, we may not be able\nto anticipate the rapidly evolving security threats, nor may we\nbe able to implement preventive measures effective against\nall such threats. The techniques used by cyber criminals change\nfrequently, may not be recognized\nuntil launched and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including\noutside groups\nsuch as external service providers, organized crime\naffiliates, terrorist organizations or\nhostile foreign governments. These\nrisks may increase in the future as the use of mobile banking\nand other internet electronic banking continues to grow.\nSecurity breaches or failures may have serious adverse financial and\nother consequences, including significant legal and\nremediation costs, disruptions to operations, misappropriation of confidential\ninformation, damage to systems operated by\nus or our third-party service providers, as well as damages to\nour customers and our counterparties. In addition, these events\ncould damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject\nus to additional regulatory scrutiny,\nor expose us\nto civil litigation and possible financial liability,\nany of which could have a material adverse effect\non our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nWe may be\nunable to attract and retain key\npeople to support our business.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract\nand retain key people. We\ncompete with other financial services\ncompanies for people primarily on the basis of compensation and\nbenefits, support services and financial position. Intense\ncompetition exists for key employees with demonstrated ability,\nand we may be unable to hire or retain such employees.\nEffective succession planning is also important to\nour long-term success. The unexpected loss of services of one or\nmore of\nour key persons and failure to ensure effective transfer\nof knowledge and smooth transitions involving such persons\ncould\nhave a material adverse effect on our business due\nto loss of their skills, knowledge of our business, their years\nof industry\nexperience and the potential difficulty of promptly finding\nqualified replacement employees.\nProposed rules implementing the executive compensation provisions\nof the Dodd-Frank Act may limit the type and\nstructure of compensation arrangements and prohibit the payment\nof \u201cexcessive compensation\u201d to our executives. These\nrestrictions could negatively affect our ability to compete\nwith other companies in recruiting and retaining key personnel.\nSevere weather,\nnatural disasters, pandemics, epidemics, acts of war or terrorism\nor other external events could have\nsignificant effects on our business.\nSevere weather and natural disasters, including hurricanes, tornados,\ndrought and floods, epidemics and pandemics, acts of\nwar or terrorism or other external events could have a significant effect\non our ability to conduct business.\nSuch events\ncould affect the stability of our deposit base,\nimpair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value\nof\ncollateral securing loans, cause significant property damage,\nresult in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional\nexpenses.\nAlthough management has established disaster recovery and business continuity\npolicies and procedures, the\noccurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect\non our business, which, in turn, could have a material\nadverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe coronavirus or COVID-19 pandemic, trade wars, tariffs,\nand similar events and disputes, domestic and international,\nhave adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect\neconomic activity globally,\nnationally and locally.\nMarket\ninterest rates have declined significantly during 2020,\nand remain low.\nSuch events also may adversely affect business\nand\nconsumer confidence, generally.\nWe and our\ncustomers, and our respective suppliers, vendors and processors\nmay be\nadversely affected.\nAny such adverse changes may adversely affect our\nprofitability, growth asset\nquality and financial\ncondition.\nFinancial Risks\nOur ability to realize our deferred\ntax assets may be reduced in the\nfuture if our estimates of future\ntaxable income from\nour operations and tax planning strategies do not support\nthis amount, and the amount of net operating loss carry-forwards\nrealizable for income tax purposes may\nbe reduced under Section 382 of\nthe Internal Revenue Code by sales of our capital\nsecurities.\nWe are\nallowed to carry-back losses for two years for Federal income tax purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had a\nnet deferred tax liability of $1.5 million with gross deferred tax assets\nof $1.9 million.\nThese and future deferred tax assets\nmay be further reduced in the future if our estimates of future\ntaxable income from our operations and tax planning\nstrategies do not support the amount of the deferred tax asset.\nThe amount of net operating loss carry-forwards realizable\nfor income tax purposes potentially could be further reduced\nunder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code by a\nsignificant offering and/or other sales of our capital securities.\nCurrent bank capital rules also reduce the regulatory capital\nbenefits of deferred tax assets.\nOur cost of funds may increase as a\nresult of general economic conditions,\ninterest rates, inflation and competitive\npressures.\nThe Federal Reserve shifted to a more accommodating monetary\npolicy in Summer 2019. During 2020, the Federal Reserve\nreduced its federal funds target to 0-0.25%\nis continuing significant monthly purchases of U.S. Treasury\nand agency\nmortgage-backed securities to help combat the economic effect\nof the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSince November 2020,\ninterest rates have increased, possibly as a result of increased government\nborrowings to finance rounds of fiscal stimulus\nand increased inflation expectations resulting from such stimulus\nand expected increases in economic growth from fiscal\nand monetary stimulus and COVID-19 vaccinations.\nOur costs of funds may increase as a result of general economic\nconditions, increasing interest rates and competitive pressures, and\npotential inflation resulting from continued government\ndeficit spending and monetary policies.\nTraditionally,\nwe have obtained funds principally through local deposits and\nborrowings from other institutional lenders, which we believe\nare a cheaper and more stable source of funds than\nborrowings.\nIncreases in interest rates may cause consumers to shift their funds to\nmore interest bearing instruments and to\nincrease the competition for and costs of deposits.\nIf customers move money out of bank deposits and into other\ninvestment assets or from transaction deposits to higher interest bearing\ntime deposits, we could lose a relatively low cost\nsource of funds, increasing our funding costs and reducing our net interest\nincome and net income. Additionally,\nany such\nloss of funds could result in lower loan originations and growth, which could\nmaterially and adversely affect our results of\noperations and financial condition.\nOur profitability and liquidity may\nbe affected by changes in interest rates and\ninterest rate levels, the shape of\nthe yield\ncurve and economic conditions.\nOur profitability depends upon net interest income, which is the difference\nbetween interest earned on interest-earning\nassets, such as loans and investments, and interest expense on interest\n-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.\nNet interest income will be adversely affected if market\ninterest rates on the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings\nincreases faster than the interest earned on loans and investments.\nInterest rates, and consequently our results of operations,\nare affected by\ngeneral economic conditions (national, international and local) and\nfiscal and monetary policies, as well as\nexpectations of these rates and policies and the shape of the yield curve.\nOur income is primarily driven by the spread\nbetween these rates. As a result, a steeper yield curve, meaning long\n-term interest rates are significantly higher than short-\nterm interest rates, would provide the Bank with a better opportunity\nto increase net interest income. Conversely,\na\nflattening yield curve could pressure our net interest margin\nas our cost of funds increases relative to the spread we can earn\non our assets. In addition, net interest income could be affected\nby asymmetrical changes in the different interest rate\nindexes, given that not all of our assets or liabilities are priced\nwith the same index.\nThe 2019 and 2020 rate reductions by\nthe Federal Reserve and the effects of the COVID\n-19 pandemic have reduced market rates, which adversely affected\nour\nnet interest income and our results of operations.\nThe production of mortgages and other loans and the value of\ncollateral securing our loans are dependent on demand within\nthe markets we serve, as well as interest rates.\nLower interest rates typically increase mortgage originations, decrease\nMSR\nvalues, and facilitate pandemic-related trends to single family houses.\nIncreases in market interest rates would tend to\ndecrease mortgage originations, increase MSR values and potentially\nincrease net interest spread depending upon the yield\ncurve and the magnitude and duration of interest rate increase.\nLiquidity risks could affect operations and jeopardize\nour financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business.\nAn inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings,\nproceeds from loan\nrepayments or sales proceeds from maturing loans and securities,\nand other sources could have a negative effect on our\nliquidity.\nOur funding sources include federal funds purchased, securities sold\nunder repurchase agreements, core and non-\ncore deposits, and short-\nand long-term debt.\nWe maintain a\nportfolio of securities that can be used as a source of liquidity.\nWe are\nalso members of the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, where\nwe can obtain advances collateralized\nwith eligible assets.\nThere are other sources of liquidity available to\nthe Company or the Bank should they be needed,\nincluding our ability to acquire additional non-core deposits.\nWe may be able, depending\nupon market conditions, to\notherwise borrow money or issue and sell debt and preferred or\ncommon securities in public or private transactions.\nOur\naccess to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or\ncapitalize our activities on terms which are acceptable to\nus\ncould be impaired by factors that affect us specifically,\nor the financial services industry or the economy in general.\nGeneral conditions that are not specific to us, such as disruptions in\nthe financial markets or negative views and\nexpectations about the prospects for the financial services industry\ncould adversely affect us.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic generally has increased our deposits and at\nbanks, generally, while\nreducing the interest rate\nearnings\navailable on loans and securities.\nSuch excess liquidity and the resulting balance sheet growth requires\ncapital\nsupport and may reduce returns on assets and equity.\nChanges in accounting and tax rules applicable to\nbanks could adversely affect our financial conditions and\nresults of\noperations.\nFrom time to time, the FASB\nand the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards\nthat govern the\npreparation of our financial statements.\nThese changes can be difficult to predict and can materially\nimpact how we record\nand report our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised\nstandard retroactively, resulting\nin us restating prior period financial statements\n.\nThe\nFASB\u2019s\nguidance under ASU No.\n2016-13 includes significant changes to the manner in which\nbanks\u2019 allowance for loan losses will be effective for\nus\nbeginning January 1, 2023.\nInstead of using historical losses, the CECL model is forward-looking\nwith respect to expected\nlosses over the life of loans and other instruments, and could materially\naffect our results of operations and financial\ncondition, including the variability of our results of operations\nand our regulatory capital, notwithstanding a three-year\nphase-in of CECL for regulatory capital purposes.\nWe may need\nto raise additional capital in the future,\nbut that capital may not be available when it is needed or\non\nfavorable terms.\nWe anticipate that our\ncurrent capital resources will satisfy our capital requirements\nfor the foreseeable future under\ncurrently effective rules.\nWe may,\nhowever, need to raise additional capital\nto support our growth or currently\nunanticipated losses, or to meet the needs of our communities,\nresulting from failures or cutbacks by our competitors.\nOur\nability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend, among\nother things, on conditions in the capital markets at that\ntime, which are limited by events outside our control, and on\nour financial performance.\nIf we cannot raise additional\ncapital on acceptable terms when needed, our ability to further\nexpand our operations through internal growth and\nacquisitions could be limited.\nOur associates may take excessive risks which could negatively\naffect our financial condition and business.\nBanks are in the business of accepting certain risks.\nOur executive officers and other members of management,\nsales\nintermediaries, investment professionals, product managers, and\nother associates, make decisions and choices that involve\nexposing us to risk. We\nendeavor, in the design and implementation\nof our compensation programs and practices, to avoid\ngiving our associates incentives to take excessive risks; however,\nassociates may nonetheless take such risks.\nSimilarly,\nalthough we employ controls and procedures designed to prevent\nmisconduct, to monitor associates\u2019 business decisions and\nprevent them from taking excessive risks, these controls and\nprocedures may not be effective. If our associates take\nexcessive risks, risks to our reputation, financial condition and\nbusiness operations could be materially and adversely\naffected.\nOur ability to continue to pay dividends to shareholders\nin the future is subject to our profitability,\ncapital, liquidity and\nregulatory requirements\nand these limitations may prevent or limit future\ndividends.\nCash available to pay dividends to our shareholders is derived\nprimarily from dividends paid to the Company by the Bank.\nThe ability of the Bank to pay dividends, as well as our ability\nto pay dividends to our shareholders, will continue to be\nsubject to and limited by laws limiting dividend payments by\nthe Bank, the results of operations of our subsidiaries and our\nneed to maintain appropriate liquidity and capital at all levels\nof our business consistent with regulatory requirements and\nthe needs of our businesses.\nSee \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d.\nA limited trading market exists for our common shares,\nwhich could result in price volatility.\nYour\nability to sell or purchase common shares depends\nupon the existence of an active trading market for our common\nstock.\nAlthough our common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Global Market\nunder the trading symbol \u201cAUBN,\u201d our historic\ntrading volume has been limited historically.\nAs a result, you may be unable to sell or purchase shares of our\ncommon\nstock at the volume, price and time that you desire.\nAdditionally, whether the purchase\nor sales prices of our common stock\nreflects a reasonable valuation of our common stock also is affected\nby an active trading market, and thus the price you\nreceive for a thinly-traded stock such as our common stock, may not\nreflect its true or intrinsic value.\nThe limited trading\nmarket for our common stock may cause fluctuations in the market value\nof our common stock to be exaggerated, leading\nto price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more\nactive trading market.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nThe Company is an entity separate and distinct from\nthe Bank.\nThe Company is an entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Company\ntransactions with the Bank are limited by Sections\n23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve\nRegulation W.\nWe depend upon the Bank\u2019s\nearnings and\ndividends, which are limited by law and regulatory policies and actions,\nfor cash to pay the Company\u2019s debt\nand corporate\nobligations, and to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nIf the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends\nto the Company was\nterminated or limited, the Company\u2019s\nliquidity and financial condition could be materially\nand adversely affected.\nLegislative and regulatory changes\nThe Biden Administration may propose changes to bank regulation and\ncorporate tax changes that could have an adverse\neffect on our results of operations and financial conditions.\nWe are\nsubject to extensive regulation\nthat could limit or restrict our activities and adversely\naffect our earnings.\nWe and our\nsubsidiaries are regulated by several regulators, including the Federal\nReserve, the Alabama Superintendent,\nthe SEC and the FDIC.\nOur success is affected by state and federal regulations affecting\nbanks and bank holding\ncompanies, and the securities markets, and our costs of compliance\ncould adversely\naffect our earnings.\nBanking\nregulations are primarily intended to protect depositors, and\nthe FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund (\u201cDIF\u201d), not shareholders.\nThe financial services industry also is subject to frequent legislative\nand regulatory changes and proposed changes.\nIn\naddition, the interpretations of regulations by regulators may\nchange and statutes may be enacted with retroactive impact.\nFrom time to time, regulators raise issues during examinations of us\nwhich, if not determined satisfactorily,\ncould have a\nmaterial adverse effect on us. Compliance with applicable\nlaws and regulations is time consuming and costly and may\naffect our profitability.\nThe position of the President and his administration that took\noffice in January 2021 with respect to\nregulation of banks and bank holding companies by our new President is\nnot yet known, their views and actions could have\na material adverse effect on financial services regulation,\ngenerally.\nLitigation and regulatory actions could\nharm our reputation and adversely affect our\nresults of operations and financial\ncondition.\nA substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against us,\nas well as regulatory inquiries or investigations,\ncould harm our reputation, result in material fines or penalties,\nresult in significant legal costs, divert management resources\naway from our business, and otherwise have a material adverse effect\non our ability to expand on our existing business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations. Even if we ultimately\nprevail in litigation, regulatory investigation or action,\nour ability to attract new customers, retain our current customers\nand recruit and retain employees could be materially and\nadversely affected. Regulatory inquiries and litigation may\nalso adversely affect the prices or volatility of our\nsecurities\nspecifically, or the securities of\nour industry, generally.\nWe are\nrequired to maintain\ncapital to meet regulatory requirements,\nand if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, our\nfinancial condition, liquidity and results\nof operations would be adversely affected.\nWe and the Bank must\nmeet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient\nliquidity, including liquidity\nat the\nCompany, as well as\nthe Bank.\nIf we fail to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements, including\nmore rigorous\nrequirements arising from our regulators\u2019 implementation of Basel\nIII, our financial condition, liquidity and results of\noperations would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur failure to remain \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and \u201cwell managed\u201d,\nincluding meeting the Basel III capital conservation buffers,\nfor bank regulatory purposes, could affect customer\nconfidence, our ability to grow,\nour costs of funds and FDIC insurance, our ability to raise\nbrokered deposits and our ability\nto pay dividends on our common stock and our ability to make acquisitions,\nand we may no longer meet the requirements\nfor becoming a financial holding company.\nThese could also affect our ability to use discretionary\nbonuses to attract and\nretain quality personnel.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules include a minimum ratio of\ncommon equity tier 1 capital, or CET1, to\nrisk-weighted assets of 4.5% and a capital conservation buffer\nof 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.\nSee\n\u201cSupervision and\nRegulation-Basel III Capital Rules.\u201d\nAlthough we currently have capital ratios that exceed all these minimum\nlevels and\na strategic plan to maintain these levels, we or the Bank may be\nunable to continue to satisfy the capital adequacy\nrequirements for various reasons, which may include:\n\u2022\nlosses and/or increases in the Bank\u2019s\ncredit risk assets and expected losses resulting from the deterioration\nin the\ncreditworthiness of borrowers and the issuers of equity and\ndebt securities;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in refinancing or issuing instruments upon redemption\nor at maturity of such instruments to raise capital\nunder acceptable terms and conditions;\n\u2022\ndeclines in the value of our securities portfolios;\n\u2022\nrevisions to the regulations or their application by our regulators\nthat increase our capital requirements;\n\u2022\nreduced total earnings on our assets will reduce our internal generation\nof capital available to support our balance\nsheet growth;\n\u2022\nreductions in the value of our MSRs and DTAs;\nand other adverse developments; and\n\u2022\nunexpected growth and an inability to increase capital timely.\nA failure to remain \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d for bank regulatory purposes,\nincluding meeting the Basel III Capital Rule\u2019s\nconservation buffer, could adversely\naffect customer confidence, and our:\n\u2022\nability to grow;\n\u2022\nthe costs of and availability of funds;\n\u2022\nFDIC deposit insurance premiums;\n\u2022\nability to raise or replace brokered deposits;\n\u2022\nability to pay dividends on our capital stock.\n\u2022\nability to make discretionary bonuses to attract and retain quality personnel;\n\u2022\nability to make acquisitions or engage in new activities;\n\u2022\nflexibility if we become subject to prompt corrective action restrictions;\n\u2022\nability to make payments of principal and interest on our capital\ninstruments; and\nThe Federal Reserve may require\nus to commit capital resources\nto support the Bank.\nAs a matter of policy, the Federal\nReserve expects a bank holding company to act as a source of financial\nand managerial\nstrength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support\nsuch subsidiary bank. The Federal Reserve may require a\nbank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled\nsubsidiary bank. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act amended\nthe FDI Act to require that all companies that control a FDIC-insured\ndepository institution serve as a source of financial\nstrength to their depository institution subsidiaries. Under these\nrequirements, we could be required to provide financial\nassistance to the Bank should it experience financial distress,\neven if further investment was not otherwise warranted. See\n\u201cSupervision and Regulation.\u201d\nOur operations are subject to risk of loss from\nunfavorable fiscal, monetary and political developments\nin the U.S.\nOur businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal, monetary\nand other policies and actions\nof various U.S.\ngovernmental and regulatory authorities. Changes in these are\nbeyond our control and are difficult to predict and,\nconsequently, changes in these\npolicies could have negative effects on our activities and results\nof operations.\nFailures of\nthe executive and legislative branches to agree on spending plans and\nbudgets previously have led to Federal government\nshutdowns, which may adversely affect the U.S. economy.\nAdditionally, any prolonged\ngovernment shutdown may inhibit\nour ability to evaluate the economy,\ngenerally, and affect\ngovernment workers who are not paid during such events, and\nwhere the absence of government services and data could adversely affect\nconsumer and business sentiment, our local\neconomy and our customers and therefore our business.\nLitigation and regulatory investigations\nare increasingly\ncommon in our businesses and\nmay result in significant financial\nlosses and/or harm to our reputation.\nWe face risks of litigation\nand regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course\nof operating our businesses,\nincluding the risk of class action lawsuits. Plaintiffs\nin class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large\nand/or\nindeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages. Due to\nthe vagaries of litigation, the ultimate outcome of\nlitigation and the amount or range of potential loss at particular\npoints in time may be difficult to ascertain. We\ndo not have\nany material pending litigation or regulatory matters affecting\nus.\nFailures to comply with the fair lending\nlaws, CFPB regulations or the Community\nReinvestment Act, or CRA, could\nadversely affect us.\nThe Bank is subject to, among other things, the provisions of\nthe Equal Credit Opportunity Act, or ECOA, and the Fair\nHousing Act, both of which prohibit discrimination based on\nrace or color, religion, national origin, sex\nand familial status\nin any aspect of a consumer, commercial credit\nor residential real estate transaction. The DOJ and the federal\nbank\nregulatory agencies have issued an Interagency Policy Statement\non Discrimination in Lending have provided guidance\nto\nfinancial institutions to evaluate whether discrimination exists\nand how the agencies will respond to lending discrimination,\nand what steps lenders might take to prevent discriminatory lending\npractices. Failures to comply with ECOA, the Fair\nHousing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations, including\nCFPB regulations, could subject us to enforcement\nactions or litigation, and could have a material adverse effect\non our business financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Bank is also subject to the CRA and periodic CRA examinations.\nThe CRA requires us to serve our entire\ncommunities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.\nOur CRA ratings could be adversely affected by actual\nor alleged violations of the fair lending or consumer financial\nprotection laws. Even though we have maintained an\n\u201csatisfactory\u201d CRA rating since 2000, we cannot predict\nour future CRA ratings. Violations of fair\nlending laws or if our\nCRA rating falls to less than \u201csatisfactory\u201d could adversely affect\nour business, including expansion through branching or\nacquisitions.\nCOVID-19 Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is expected to continue\nto adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of\noperations. The ultimate effects of the pandemic on us will depend\non the severity, scope and\nduration of the pandemic, its\ncumulative economic effects, governmental actions\nin response to the pandemic, and the\nrestoration of a more\nnormal\neconomy.\nThe COVID-19 national health emergency has significantly disrupted\nthe United States and international economies and\nfinancial markets. We\nexpect that the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects\nwill continue to adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations in future periods. The\nspread of COVID-19 has caused illness, quarantines,\ncancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reductions\nin business activity and financial transactions,\nsupply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability.\nThe State of Alabama and many other\nstates have taken preventative and protective actions, such as\nimposing a statewide mask mandate, restrictions on travel,\nbusiness operations, public gatherings, social distancing, advising\nor requiring individuals to limit or forego their time\noutside of their homes, and ordering temporary closures of non-essential\nbusinesses. Though certain of these measures have\nbeen relaxed or eliminated, the pandemic has moved in disruptive\nand unpredictable waves.\nThe travel, hospitality and food and beverage industries, restaurants,\nretailers and auto manufacturers, and their suppliers\nhave been severely affected. A significant number of layoffs,\nfurloughs of employees, as well as remote work have\noccurred in these and other industries, including government offices,\nschools and universities. Auburn University held\nvirtual classes only from March 16, 2020 through the summer\nsession. Auburn University\u2019s\nguidelines for the spring\nsemester of 2020 and the 2021 involve both remote and in person\ninstructions as well as social distancing measures and\nmodified class schedules. The economic effects of these\nmeasures is not presently known. Hyundai\u2019s\nMontgomery and\nKia\u2019s West\nPoint, Georgia plants were closed for a portion of the first\nquarter of 2020, but began a phased reopen in the\nsecond quarter of 2020 in response to COVID-19.\nThe ultimate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the\neconomy, generally,\nour markets, and on us cannot be predicted.\nThe timing and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on\nour business, results of operations and financial condition may\ninclude, among various other consequences, the following. These\neffects depend on the severity,\nscope and duration of the\npandemic, its cumulative economic effects, and the effectiveness\nof healthcare, business and governmental actions\naddressing the pandemic\u2019s effects,\nincluding vaccinations.\n\u2022\nEmployees\u2019 health could be adversely affected, necessitating\ntheir recovery away from work;\n\u2022\nUnavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities;\n\u2022\nOur operating effectiveness may be reduced\nas our employees work from home or suffer from the COVID\nvirus;\n\u2022\nShelter in place, remote work or other restrictions and interruptions of\nour business and contact with our\ncustomers;\n\u2022\nSustained closures\nof our branch lobbies or the offices of our\ncustomers;\n\u2022\nDeclines in demand for loans and other banking services and products,\nand reduced usage and interchange fees\non our payment cards;\n\u2022\nContinuing large scale fiscal and monetary stimulus actions\nmay stabilize the economy, but\nmay increase\neconomic and market risks, including valuation \u201cbubbles,\u201d volati\nlity in various assets and inflation;\n\u2022\nInflation and increases in interest rates may result from fiscal\nstimulus and monetary stimulus, and the Federal\nReserve has indicated it is willing to permit inflation to run moderately\nabove its 2% target for some time;\n\u2022\nIncreased savings and debt reduction by consumers could reduce\ndemand for credit and our earning assets;\n\u2022\nSignificant volatility in United States financial markets and our\ninvestment securities portfolio, including credit\nconcerns in municipal securities;\n\u2022\nDeclines in the credit quality of our loan portfolio, owing to\nthe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the\nmarkets we serve, leading to increased provisions for loan losses and\nincreases in our allowance for possible\ncredit losses;\n\u2022\nDeclines in the value of collateral for loans, including real estate\ncollateral, especially in industries such as\ntravel, hospitality, restaura\nnts and retailers;\n\u2022\nDeclines in the net worth and liquidity of borrowers, impairing their\nability to pay timely their loan obligations\nto us;\n\u2022\nGenerally low market interest rates that reduce our net interest\nincome and our profitability;\n\u2022\nLoan deferrals and loan modifications, and mortgage foreclosure\nmoratoria, including those mandated by law,\nor\nwhich are encouraged by our regulators, may increase our expense\nand risks of collectability,\nreduce our cash\nflows and liquidity and adversely affect our results of operations\nand financial condition;\n\u2022\nThe end of temporary regulatory accounting and capital relief for\nbanks regarding the effects of the COVID-19\npandemic, including loan deferrals and modifications, could\nincrease our TDRs and require additions to our\nallowance for loan losses, which may adversely affect\nour income, financial condition and capital;\n\u2022\nOur waiver of various fees and service charges to support\nour customers and communities will adversely affect\nour results of operation and our liquidity and financial position;\n\u2022\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may change customer financial behaviors\nand payment practices. Electronic banking\ncould become more popular with less customers doing business\nat our offices;\n\u2022\nCertain of our assets, including loans and securities, may become\nimpaired, which would adversely affect our\nresults of operation and financial condition and mortgage loan foreclosure\nmoratoria may limit our ability to\ntimely act to protect our interests in the loan collateral;\n\u2022\nReductions in income or losses will adversely affect\nour capital and growth of capital, including our capital for\nbank regulatory purposes;\n\u2022\nLosses or reductions in net income may adversely affect the\ngrowth or amount of dividends we can pay on our\ncommon stock;\n\u2022\nThe effects of government fiscal and monetary policies,\nincluding changes in such policies, or the effects\nof\nCOVID-19 relief programs are discontinued, on the economy and\nfinancial stability, generally,\nand on our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition cannot\nbe predicted;\n\u2022\nCybercriminals may increase their attempts to compromise business\nand consumer emails, including an increase\nin phishing attempts, and fraudulent vendors or other parties\nmay view the pandemic as an opportunity to prey\nupon consumers and businesses during this time.\n\u2022\nThe restoration of financial stability and economic growth may\ndepend on the health care system developing and\ndeploying COVID-19 testing and contact tracing, and delivery of COVID\n-19 vaccines, which promote consumer\nand employee health and confidence in the economy.\nThese factors, together or in combination with other events or\noccurrences that are unknown or anticipated, may materially\nand adversely affect our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nOur stock price may reflect securities market conditions\nThe ongoing COVID-19\npandemic has resulted in substantial securities\nmarket volatility, especially for\nbank stocks and\nhas, and may continue to, adversely affect the market of\nour common stock. The spread, intensification and duration\nof\nCOVID-19 pandemic, as well as the effectiveness of governmental,\nfiscal and monetary policies, and regulatory responses\nto the pandemic, further affect the financial markets and\nthe market prices for securities generally,\nand the market prices for\nbank stocks, including our common stock.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic could result\nin deterioration of asset quality and an increase\nin credit losses.\nMany businesses have had, and may continue to have lower revenues\nand cash flows and many consumers will have lower\nincome. These could result in an inability to repay loans timely in full,\nreduce our asset quality and reduce our deposits.\nLoan modifications and payment deferrals may also increase\nour credit risks, especially when temporary regulatory relief\nfor these actions expires. Our business, results of operations,\nliquidity and financial condition could be adversely\naffected.\nAs a participating lender in the PPP,\nthe Bank is subject to additional risks of litigation from\nthe Bank\u2019s\ncustomers or other\nparties regarding\nthe Bank\u2019s\nprocessing of loans for the PPP and\nrisks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan\nguaranties.\nThe CARES Act, Paycheck Protection Program and Healthcare\nEnhancement Act and Economic Aid Act appropriated\nmore than $1 trillion in funding for PPP loans administered\nthrough by the SBA and the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\nUnder the PPP,\neligible small businesses and other entities and individuals can apply for\nloans from existing SBA lenders\nand other approved PPP lenders, subject to numerous limitations\nand eligibility criteria. The Bank is participating as a\nlender in the PPP and made $36.5 million of PPP loans in 2020.\nThe PPP loans charge 1% interest annually.\nForgiveness\nof these loans has been slow, and\nPPP loans earn less than market rates.\nSince the opening of the PPP,\nvarious banks have\nbeen subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures\nused in processing applications for the PPP,\nand greater\ngovernmental attention is directed at preventing fraud.\nWe may be exposed\nto similar litigation risks, from both customers\nand non-customers that approached the Bank regarding PPP\nloans we extended. If any such litigation is filed against the\nBank and is not resolved favorably to the Bank, it may result\nin financial liability or adversely affect our reputation.\nLitigation can be costly, regardless\nof outcome. Any financial liability,\nlitigation costs or reputational damage caused by\nPPP related litigation could have a material adverse effect\non our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank also has credit risk on PPP loans, if the SBA determines\ndeficiencies in the manner in which PPP loans were\noriginated, funded or serviced by the Bank, such as an issue with the\neligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, or\nobtain forgiveness of a PPP properly,\nincluding those related to the ambiguities in the laws,\nrules and guidance regarding\nthe PPP\u2019s operation. In\nthe event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a\ndetermination by the SBA that there\nwere one or more deficiencies in the manner in which the PPP\nloan was originated, funded, or serviced by the Company,\nthe SBA may deny its liability under the PPP loan guaranty,\nreduce the amount of the guaranty,\nor, if it has already paid\nunder the guaranty, seek recovery of\nany loss related to the deficiency from the Company.\nSimilar issues may also result in\nthe denial of forgiveness of PPP loans, which could expose\nus to potential borrower bankruptcies and potential losses and\nadditional costs.", "PERMNO": 82251, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "AUBN"}
