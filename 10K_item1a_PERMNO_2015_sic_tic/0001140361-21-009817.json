RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to invest in the shares of our common stock. The occurrence of any of the events described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In the case of such an event, the trading price of our common stock may decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRISK FACTOR SUMMARY\nWe are providing the following summary of the risk factors contained in our Form 10-K to enhance the readability and accessibility of our risk factor disclosures. We encourage our stockholders to carefully review the full risk factors contained in this Form 10-K in their entirety for additional information regarding the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.\nRisks Related to Business and Operations\n\u2022 The impact of COVID-19 on our business, operating results, cash flows, year-over-year performance and/or financial condition is significant and uncertain, and the impact could be material and adverse;\n\u2022 The impact of COVID-19 and the related testing and vaccination may result in us not being able to accurately forecast health care and other benefit costs, and we are uncertain whether future health care and other benefits costs could exceed our projections;\n\u2022 We may not be able to execute our opportunistic buying strategy;\n\u2022 Consumer confidence and spending may be reduced in light of factors beyond our control and our financial results may suffer;\n\u2022 Competition may increase in our segment of the retail market, which could put negative pressure on our results of operations and financial condition;\n\u2022 Identification of potential store locations and lease negotiations may not keep pace with our growth strategy;\nIndex\n\u2022 We are a \u201cbrick and mortar only\u201d retailer. Our lack of an online shopping option may mean that we face challenges to grow and retain customers. Our customers, including our loyalty program members, may determine to shop at other stores or through web-enabled services and therefore not be as likely to shop at our stores;\n\u2022 We may not be able to develop and operate our multiple distribution centers in an efficient or effective manner and that could mean that we do not have sufficient inventory in our store locations. The loss or disruption of one or more of our distribution centers or disruption of our supply chain or third-party shipping carriers could also make it difficult for us to timely receive or distribute goods to our stores;\n\u2022 External economic pressures over which we have no or limited control, including inflation, occupancy costs, and transportation costs may reduce our profitability;\n\u2022 Inventory management and/or shrinkage or the loss or theft of inventory can result in material negative impacts on our results of operations;\n\u2022 We need to be able to hire and retain the right people to run our stores and our distribution centers. We also need to hire and retain managerial personnel, a merchant team and executive officers. If we are not effective in these areas, our results may suffer; and\n\u2022 Comparable store sales and results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may do so again in the future.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Issues\n\u2022 We are subject to governmental regulations, procedures and requirements that can lead to substantial penalties if we fail to achieve compliance;\n\u2022 We are subject to risks associated with laws and regulations generally applicable to retailers;\n\u2022 From time to time we are involved in legal proceedings from customers, suppliers, employees, governments or competitors; and\n\u2022 From time to time we are involved in legal proceedings from stockholders.\nRisks Related to Technology and Cybersecurity\n\u2022 We may fail to maintain the security of information we hold relating to personal information or payment card data of our customers, employees and suppliers;\n\u2022 We may not adequately prepare for or respond to existing and future privacy legislation; and\n\u2022 We may not be able to timely or adequately maintain or upgrade our technology systems needed for operations.\nRisks Related to Accounting and Financial Matters\n\u2022 If our estimates or judgements relating to significant accounting policies prove to be incorrect, we could suffer negative financial results; and\n\u2022 Changes to the accounting rules or regulations could have material adverse effects on our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock and Corporate Governance\n\u2022 There is risk associated with our fluctuating quarterly operating results and we may fall short of prior periods, our projections or the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u2022 We may not declare dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future; and\n\u2022 There are provisions in our organizational documents that could delay or prevent a change of control.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Capitalization\n\u2022 Our credit facility can limit our ability to find other sources of financing;\n\u2022 There are covenants contained in our credit facility that we must meet in order to be able to use it; and\n\u2022 If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to meet debt service it could negatively impact our liquidity.\nFor a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, see below.\nIndex\nBUSINESS AND OPERATIONS\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and is expected to continue to disrupt our business, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition for an extended period of time.\nDuring March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak to be a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted health and economic conditions throughout the United States, as public concern about becoming ill with the virus has led to the issuance of recommendations and/or mandates from federal, state and local authorities to practice social distancing or self-quarantine. Over the course of 2020, we continued to operate our stores as we qualified under definitions of an \u201cessential\u201d business. In response to the challenges of COVID-19, at times we have had to implement reduced store hours, limited the number of customers in our stores at any one time and have generally implemented social-distancing guidelines throughout our store operating space.\nIf the classification of what is an \u201cessential\u201d business changes in jurisdictions where our stores are located, or the restrictions on retail operations in our markets are reinstituted, or other government regulations are adopted pertaining to how we may operate our stores, we may be required to temporarily close or restrict operations at one or more, if not all, of our stores, which would significantly impact our sales and results of operations. Also, if we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic, or if customers do not perceive our response to be adequate for a particular region or our company as a whole, we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brand, which could adversely affect our business in the future, and subject us to costly litigation, enforcement actions and penalties.\nCOVID-19 has also impacted our supply chain for products we sell, particularly those products that are sourced internationally. To the extent one or more of our vendors is negatively impacted by COVID-19, including due to the closure of its distribution centers or manufacturing facilities, we may be unable to maintain delivery schedules or adequate inventory in our stores.\nWe were generally able to remain open in 2020, including at times when some businesses were required to close or operate under severe restrictions. This, coupled with measures taken by governmental authorities to stimulate consumer behavior, resulted in significant impacts on our operations, including, without limitation, on cash flows, inventory supply, operating results, and demand for products by our customers. The factors listed above, together with the unprecedented environment created during the pandemic drove performance results during our most recently completed fiscal year that may not be a meaningful indicator of future results.\nThe impacts of the uncertainties surrounding the outbreak of COVID-19 also make it more challenging for us to estimate future performance of the business, predict customer acceptance of new products and offerings, and to develop growth strategies for the future. We are continuing to monitor the spread of COVID-19 and the related risks to our business and operations. The magnitude and duration of the pandemic and its impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial position, employees, and customers are uncertain as this situation continues to evolve globally.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak impacts our business, results of operations, and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to the duration, spread, severity and impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, the effects of the outbreak on our customers, employees and vendors, the regulatory response and impact of stimulus measures adopted by local, state and federal governments, and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we could experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic disruption that has occurred or may occur in the future due to a continued erosion in consumer sentiment or the effect of unemployment on our consumer base. Additionally, the consumer preferences for certain product categories that have driven positive sales during the COVID-19 outbreak may not continue after the outbreak has subsided, and any change in consumer preferences could negatively impact our results of operations. Furthermore, the financial condition of our customers and vendors may be adversely impacted by the pandemic, which may result in a decrease in discretionary consumer spending and our store traffic and sales, and an increase in bankruptcies or insolvencies with respect to our vendors. These events may, in turn, have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. In the event of a prolonged material economic downturn, including circumstances that require us to close a large portion of our stores or cause us to experience a further reduction in store traffic, we may not be able to comply with the financial covenants in our credit facility, which could negatively impact our ability to borrow under that facility or with other lenders, negatively impact our liquidity position.\nIndex\nIn addition to the many and varied costs that are associated with COVID-19, our ability to predict healthcare and other benefit costs may be limited.\nCOVID-19 and the related testing and vaccination costs are inherently uncertain and therefore very difficult to predict. These costs, and the costs associated with other healthcare impacts of COVID-19, may significantly impair our ability to timely and accurately forecast health care and other benefit costs for this or further periods. As a result, we may have difficulty establishing accurate budgetary reserves or estimates for these and other costs, which could in turn, negatively impact our results of operations and expenses.\nWe may not be able to execute our opportunistic buying strategy, adequately manage our supply of inventory or anticipate customer demand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to strategically source a sufficient volume and variety of brand name merchandise at opportunistic pricing. We do not have significant control over the supply, design, function, cost or availability of many of the products that we offer for sale in our stores. Additionally, because a substantial amount of our store products are sourced by us from suppliers on a closeout basis or with significantly reduced prices for specific reasons, we are not always able to purchase specific merchandise on a recurring basis. We do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers and, therefore, we have no contractual assurances of pricing or access to products and any supplier could discontinue sales to us at any time or offer us less favorable terms on future transactions. We generally make individual purchase decisions for products that become available, and these purchases may be for large quantities that we may not be able to sell on a timely or cost-effective basis. To the extent that certain of our suppliers are better able to manage their inventory levels and reduce the amount of their excess inventory, the amount of discount or closeout merchandise available to us could also be materially reduced, potentially compromising profit margin goals for procured merchandise. Due to economic uncertainties, governmental orders, or other challenges relating to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, one or more of our suppliers could become unable to continue supplying discounted or closeout merchandise on terms or in quantities acceptable or desirable to us. We also compete with other retailers, wholesalers and jobbers for discounted or closeout merchandise to sell in our stores. Those businesses may be better able to anticipate customer demand or procure desirable goods. Shortages or disruptions in the availability of brand name or unbranded products of a quality acceptable to our customers and us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and also may result in customer dissatisfaction. In addition, we may significantly overstock products that prove to be undesirable and be forced to take significant markdowns. We cannot ensure that our merchant team will continue to identify the appropriate customer demand and take advantage of appropriate buying opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIndex\nOur ability to generate revenues is dependent on consumer confidence and spending, which may be subject to factors beyond our control, including changes in economic and political conditions, and health concerns.\nThe success of our business depends, to a significant extent, on the level of consumer confidence and spending. A number of factors beyond our control affect the level of customer confidence and spending on merchandise that we offer, including, among other things:\n\u2022 energy and gasoline prices;\n\u2022 disposable income of our customers, which may be impacted by unemployment levels, personal debt levels and minimum wages;\n\u2022 discounts, promotions and merchandise offered by our competitors;\n\u2022 negative reports and publicity about the discount retail industry;\n\u2022 outbreak of viruses or widespread illness, including COVID-19, and behavioral changes from a fear of contracting such viruses or illness;\n\u2022 general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022 food prices;\n\u2022 interest rates and inflation;\n\u2022 the state of the housing market;\n\u2022 customer confidence in future economic conditions;\n\u2022 fluctuations in the financial markets;\n\u2022 tax rates and policies; and\n\u2022 natural disasters, war, terrorism and other hostilities.\nReduced customer confidence and spending cutbacks may result in reduced demand for our merchandise, including discretionary items, and may force us to take inventory markdowns. Reduced demand also may require increased selling and promotional expenses. Adverse economic conditions and any related decrease in customer demand for our merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, recent fears of contagion or disease related to the widespread outbreak of COVID-19 may cause customers to avoid shopping at brick and mortar retailers or reduce the number of trips they will make to our stores. Similarly, negative economic conditions related to this outbreak may limit the amount of disposable income available to our customers, which may limit our consumer demand.\nMany of the factors identified above also affect commodity rates, transportation costs, costs of labor, insurance and healthcare, the strength of the U.S. dollar, lease costs, measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, changes in other laws and regulations and other economic factors, all of which may impact our cost of goods sold and our selling, general and administrative expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not compete in the growing online retail marketplace, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur long-term business strategy does not presently include the development of online retailing capabilities. To the extent that we implement online operations, we would incur substantial expenses related to such activities and would be exposed to additional cybersecurity risks. Furthermore, any development of an online retail marketplace is a complex undertaking, and there is no guarantee that any resources we apply to this effort will result in increased revenues or operating performance. However, with the growing acceptance of online shopping, which may have accelerated as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, both among consumers who previously shopped online and consumers who did not previously do so, or did not do so as frequently, we may continue to face challenges related to customers shopping in brick and mortar stores. In addition, the increased proliferation of mobile devices, enhanced and robust connections to mobile networks, competition from other retailers in the online retail marketplace is expected to continue to increase and may negatively impact our results of operations. Certain of our competitors and a number of pure online retailers have established robust online operations. Increased competition from online retailers and our lack of an online retail presence may reduce our customers\u2019 desire to purchase goods from us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If consumers determine to shop more online due to cultural or health concerns, they may be less likely to return to brick and mortar retailers in the future.\nIndex\nWe face intense competition, which could limit our growth opportunities and adversely impact our financial performance.\nWe compete with a highly fragmented group of competitors, including discount, closeout, mass merchant, department, grocery, drug, convenience, hardware, variety, online and other specialty stores. We compete with these retailers with respect to product price, store location, supply and quality of merchandise, assortment and presentation and customer service. This competitive environment subjects us to the risk of an adverse impact to our financial performance because of the lower prices, and thus the lower margins, that are required to maintain our competitive position. A number of different competitive factors outside of our control could impact our ability to compete effectively, including:\n\u2022 entry of new competitors in our markets;\n\u2022 increased operational efficiencies of competitors;\n\u2022 online retail capabilities of our competitors;\n\u2022 competitive pricing strategies, including deep discount pricing by a broad range of retailers during periods of poor customer confidence, low discretionary income or economic uncertainty;\n\u2022 continued and prolonged promotional activity by our competitors;\n\u2022 liquidation sales by our competitors that have filed or may file in the future for bankruptcy;\n\u2022 geographic expansion by competitors into markets in which we currently operate; and\n\u2022 adoption by existing competitors of innovative store formats or retail sales methods, including online.\nA number of our competitors also have greater financial and operational resources, greater brand recognition, longer operating histories and broader geographic presences than us. We remain vulnerable to the marketing power and high level of customer recognition of these larger competitors and to the risk that these or other competitors could attract our customer base, including, but not limited to, the members of Ollie\u2019s Army.\nIn addition, if any of our competitors were to consolidate their operations, such consolidation may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved access to merchandise, greater market penetration and other improvements in their competitive positions, as well as result in the provision of a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices by these consolidated companies, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to successfully compete against either existing or future competitors. Our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, improved performance by our competitors and changes in the retail markets could result in lost market share and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIndex\nIf we fail to open new profitable stores on a timely basis, successfully enter new markets or implement other elements of our long-term growth strategy, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.\nOur primary growth strategy is to open new profitable stores and expand our operations into new geographic regions. We opened 46 and 42 new stores in 2020 and 2019, respectively, as we continue to backfill in existing markets and expand into contiguous geographies. Our ability to timely open new stores depends in part on several factors, including the availability of attractive rents and store locations; the absence of occupancy delays; the ability to negotiate and enter into leases with acceptable terms; our ability to obtain and retain permits and licenses; our ability to hire and train new personnel, especially store managers, in a cost effective manner; our ability to adapt and grow our distribution and other operational and management systems to a changing network of stores; the availability of capital funding for expansion; our ability to respond to demographic shifts in areas where our stores are located and general economic conditions.\nWe may not anticipate all of the challenges imposed by the expansion of our operations into new geographic markets. Some new stores may be located in areas with different competitive and market conditions, customer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets. We may face a higher cost of entry, difficulties attracting labor, alternative customer demands, reduced brand recognition and minimal operating experience in these areas. Although we are extremely sensitive to cannibalizing existing stores, opening new stores in our established markets may also result in inadvertent oversaturation, sales volume transfer from existing stores to new stores and reduced comparable store sales, thus adversely affecting our overall financial performance. We may not manage our expansion effectively, and our failure to achieve or properly execute our expansion plans could limit our growth or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to retain the loyalty of our customers, particularly Ollie\u2019s Army members, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our loyal customer base, particularly members of Ollie\u2019s Army, for our consistent sales and sales growth. Competition for customers has intensified as competitors have moved into, or increased their presence in, our geographic markets and from the use of mobile and web-based technology that facilitates online shopping and real-time product and price comparisons. We expect this competition to continue to increase. Our competitors may be able to offer consumers promotions or loyalty program incentives that could attract Ollie\u2019s Army members or divide their loyalty among several retailers. If we are unable to retain the loyalty of our customers, our net sales could decrease and we may not be able to grow our store base as planned, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIndex\nThe failure to timely acquire, develop, and open, the loss of, or disruption or interruption in the operations of, our centralized distribution centers could materially adversely affect our business and operations.\nWith few exceptions, inventory is shipped directly from suppliers to our distribution centers in York, PA, Commerce, GA, and Lancaster, TX, where the inventory is then processed, sorted and shipped to our stores. We depend in large part on the orderly operation of this receiving and distribution process, which depends, in turn, on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management of our distribution centers. Increases in transportation costs (including increases in fuel costs), supplier-side delays, reductions in the capacity of carriers, changes in shipping companies, the impact of COVID-19 on our workforce, labor strikes or shortages in the transportation industry and unexpected delivery interruptions also have the potential to derail our orderly distribution process. We also may not anticipate changing demands on our distribution system or timely develop and open any necessary additional facilities. In addition, events beyond our control, such as disruptions in operations due to fire or other catastrophic events or labor disagreements, may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores. While we maintain business interruption insurance, in the event our distribution centers are shut down for any reason, such insurance may not be sufficient, and any related insurance proceeds may not be timely paid to us. In addition, our new store locations receiving shipments may be further away from our distribution centers, which may increase transportation costs and may create transportation scheduling strains. Any repeated, intermittent, or long-term disruption in the operations of our distribution centers would hinder our ability to provide merchandise to our stores and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on third parties to move goods through ports and transport them from ports to our centralized distribution centers.\nOur ability to timely and effectively deliver goods to our stores relies in part on shipping and transportation partners to timely and safely move our goods from manufacturing facilities to ports and then onto oceangoing carriers. The demand for space onboard oceangoing vessels can vary and costs to secure space can vary greatly. We may be subject to higher transportation costs or be unable to secure space for containers on economically reasonable terms. In addition, there may be labor or other disputes at either ports of departure or at ports of entry that may delay or otherwise hinder the flow of goods. Additional factors, such as customs or border control policies, may further delay or hinder transportation of goods or the costs to obtain them. There are multiple factors in the transportation of goods from the manufacturer that are both outside of our control and which may negatively impact the cost of the goods or the timeframes in which we receive them.\nOur new store growth is dependent on our ability to successfully expand our distribution network capacity, and failure to achieve or sustain these plans could affect our performance adversely.\nWe maintain distribution centers in York, PA, Commerce, GA and Lancaster, TX to support our existing stores and our growth objectives. We continuously assess ways to maximize the productivity and efficiency of our existing distribution facilities and evaluate opportunities for additional distribution centers. Processing delays or difficulties in operations at our existing distribution centers or any future new distribution centers could adversely affect our current operations by causing existing stores to have insufficient inventory, and affect future operations by slowing store growth, which could, in turn, reduce sales growth. In addition, any distribution-related construction or expansion projects entail risks which could cause delays and cost overruns, such as shortages of materials, shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages, unforeseen construction, scheduling, engineering, environmental or geological problems, COVID-19 or other strains or types of contagion, weather interference, fires or other casualty losses and unanticipated cost increases. The completion date and ultimate cost of future projects could differ significantly from initial expectations due to construction-related or other reasons. We cannot guarantee that any project will be completed on time or within established budgets.\nFactors such as inflation, cost increases and energy prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture increases in costs, such as the cost of merchandise, shipping rates, freight costs (including import costs) and store occupancy costs, may reduce our profitability, given our pricing model. These cost increases may be the result of inflationary pressures, geopolitical factors or public policies, which could further reduce our sales or profitability. Increases in other operating costs, including changes in energy prices, wage rates and lease and utility costs, may increase our cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative expenses. Our low price model and competitive pressures in our industry may have the effect of inhibiting our ability to reflect these increased costs in the prices of our products and, therefore, reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIndex\nIf we are not successful in managing our inventory balances, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur inventory balance represented 37.2% of our total assets exclusive of operating lease right-of-use assets, goodwill and trade name as of January 30, 2021. Efficient inventory management is a key component of our profitability and ability to generate revenue. To be successful, we must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate product mix to meet our customers\u2019 demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs to store and hold the goods adversely impact our results of operations. If our buying decisions do not accurately correspond to customer preferences, if we inappropriately price products or if our expectations about customer spending levels are inaccurate, we may have to take unanticipated markdowns to dispose of any excess inventory, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We continue to focus on ways to reduce these risks, but we cannot ensure that we will be successful in our inventory management. If we are not successful in managing our inventory balances, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInventory shrinkage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to the risk of inventory loss and theft. We cannot ensure that actual rates of inventory loss and theft in the future will be within our estimates or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce the problem of inventory shrinkage. Although some level of inventory shrinkage is an unavoidable cost of doing business, if we were to experience higher rates of inventory shrinkage or incur increased security costs and other costs to combat inventory theft, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEpidemic or pandemic outbreaks such as COVID-19, natural disasters, whether or not caused by climate change, unusual weather conditions, terrorist acts and political events could disrupt business and result in lower sales and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, fires, floods and earthquakes, unusual weather conditions, epidemic outbreaks, terrorist attacks or disruptive political events in certain regions where our stores are located could adversely affect our business and result in lower sales. Epidemic or pandemic outbreaks, such as COVID-19 could impact our management and sales associates, our inventory supply, delivery schedules, our ability to keep our stores open due to mandatory governmental restrictions or may cause our customers to avoid shopping at brick and mortar retailers or reduce the number of trips they will make to our stores. To the extent these events also impact one or more of our key suppliers or result in the closure of one or more of our centralized distribution centers or our corporate headquarters, we may be unable to maintain delivery schedules or provide other support functions to our stores. This could have a sustained material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, severe weather, such as heavy snowfall or extreme temperatures, may discourage or restrict customers in a particular region from traveling to our stores, thereby reducing our sales and profitability. If severe weather conditions occur during the second or fourth quarter of our fiscal year, the adverse impact to our sales and profitability could be even greater than at other times during the year because we generate a larger portion of our sales and profits during these periods. Natural disasters, which may include tornadoes, hurricanes, floods and earthquakes may impact our store locations or other operations. In addition, climate change may have an impact on the frequency and/or severity of such natural disasters. We have a growing number of store locations in areas that may be impacted by weather events and natural disasters such as the types listed above. To the extent that such weather events or natural disasters may damage our stores or other operations, we may be unable to operate stores or other facilitates and our consolidated financial results may be materially adversely affected.\nFluctuations in comparable store sales and results of operations, including fluctuations on a quarterly basis, could cause our business performance to decline substantially.\nOur results of operations have fluctuated in the past, including on a quarterly basis, and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future.\nIndex\nOur comparable store sales and results of operations are affected by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022 national and regional economic trends in the United States;\n\u2022 challenges and the impact of COVID and related regulations;\n\u2022 changes in gasoline prices;\n\u2022 changes in our merchandise mix;\n\u2022 the weather;\n\u2022 changes in pricing;\n\u2022 changes in the timing of promotional and advertising efforts; and\n\u2022 holidays or seasonal periods.\nIf our future comparable store sales fail to meet expectations, then our cash flow and profitability could decline substantially, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on our executive officers, our merchant team and other key personnel. If we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our executive officers, our merchant team and other key personnel. The unexpected loss of services of any of our executive officers or senior members of our merchant team could materially adversely affect our business and operations. Competition for skilled and experienced management in the retail industry is intense, and our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including our merchant team, which is responsible for purchasing and negotiating the terms of our merchandise. Failure to attract and retain new qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract, train and retain highly qualified managerial personnel and sales associates in our stores and our distribution centers, our sales, financial performance and business operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe focus on providing our customers with a memorable and engaging shopping experience. To grow our operations and meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, train and retain a large number of highly qualified store management personnel and sales associates, while controlling labor costs. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors and compliance with regulatory structures, including competition for and availability of qualified personnel in a given market, unemployment levels within those markets, governmental regulatory bodies such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the National Labor Relations Board, prevailing wage rates and wage and hour laws, minimum wage laws, the impact of legislation governing labor and employee relations or benefits, such as the Affordable Care Act, health insurance costs and our ability to maintain good relations with our associates. We compete with other retail businesses for many of our store management personnel and sales associates in hourly and part-time positions. These positions have had historically high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training and retention costs. We also rely on associates in our distribution centers to ensure the efficient processing and delivery of products from our suppliers to our stores. If we are unable to attract and retain quality associates, and other management personnel, or fail to comply with the regulations and laws impacting personnel, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends on our marketing, advertising and promotional efforts. If we are unable to implement them successfully, or if our competitors are more effective than we are, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use marketing and promotional programs to attract customers to our stores and to encourage purchases by our customers. Although we use various media for our promotional efforts, including regular and Ollie\u2019s Army mailers, email campaigns, radio and television advertisements and sports marketing, we primarily advertise our in-store offerings through printed flyers. In 2020, approximately 62% of our advertising spend was for the printing and distribution of flyers. If the efficacy of printed flyers as an advertising medium declines, or if we fail to successfully develop and implement new marketing, advertising and promotional strategies, such as an effective social media strategy, our competitors may be able to attract the interest of our customers, which could reduce customer traffic in our stores. Changes in the amount and degree of promotional intensity or merchandising strategy by our competitors could cause us to have difficulties in retaining existing customers and attracting new customers. If the efficacy of our marketing or promotional activities declines or if such activities of our competitors are more effective than ours, or if for any other reason we lose the loyalty of our customers, including our Ollie\u2019s Army members, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIndex\nBecause our business is seasonal, with the highest volume of net sales during the holiday season, adverse events during our fourth fiscal quarter could materially adversely affect our business, operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nWe generally recognize our highest volume of net sales in connection with the holiday sales season, which occurs in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. In anticipation of the holiday sales season, we purchase substantial amounts of seasonal inventory and hire many part-time associates. Because a significant percentage of our net sales and operating income are generated in our fourth fiscal quarter, we have limited ability to compensate for shortfalls in our fourth fiscal quarter sales or earnings by changing our operations or strategies in other fiscal quarters. Adverse events, such as deteriorating economic conditions, higher unemployment, higher gas prices, public transportation disruptions, errors in anticipating consumer demand for our products, or unanticipated adverse or unseasonable weather conditions could result in lower than planned sales during the holiday sales season. If our fourth fiscal quarter sales results were substantially below expectations, we would realize less cash flows from operations, and may be forced to mark down our merchandise, especially our seasonal merchandise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business requires that we lease substantial amounts of space and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to lease space on terms as favorable as the leases negotiated in the past.\nWe lease the majority of our store locations, our corporate headquarters and our distribution facilities in York, PA and Commerce, GA. Our stores are leased from third parties, with typical initial lease terms of approximately seven years with options to renew for three to five successive five-year periods. We believe that we have been able to negotiate favorable rental rates over the last few years due in large part to the general state of the economy, the increased availability of vacant big box retail sites and our careful identification of favorable lease opportunities. While we will continue to seek out advantageous lease opportunities, there is no guarantee that we will continue to be able to find low-cost second generation sites or obtain favorable lease terms. Many of our lease agreements have defined escalating rent provisions over the initial term and any extensions. Increases in our occupancy costs and difficulty in identifying economically suitable new store locations could have significant negative consequences, which include:\n\u2022 requiring that a greater portion of our available cash be applied to pay our rental obligations, thus reducing cash available for other purposes and reducing profitability;\n\u2022 increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes in, our business or in the industry in which we compete.\nIndex\nWe depend on cash flows from operations to pay our lease expenses and to fulfill our other cash needs. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to fund these expenses and needs and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us, we may not be able to service our lease expenses, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital needs, which could harm our business. Additional sites that we lease may be subject to long-term non-cancelable leases if we are unable to negotiate our current standard lease terms. If an existing or future store is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Moreover, even if a lease has an early cancellation clause, we may not satisfy the contractual requirements for early cancellation under that lease. In addition, if we are not able to enter into new leases or renew existing leases on terms acceptable to us, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY\nWe are subject to governmental regulations, procedures and requirements. A significant change in, or noncompliance with, these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe routinely incur significant costs in complying with federal, state and local laws and regulations. The complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are increasing due to expanding and additional legal and regulatory requirements and increased enforcement efforts. New laws or regulations, including those dealing with healthcare reform, product safety, consumer credit, privacy and information security and labor and employment, among others, or changes in existing federal, state and local laws and regulations, particularly those governing the sale of products and food safety and quality (including changes in labeling or disclosure requirements), federal or state wage requirements, employee rights, health care, social welfare or entitlement programs such as health insurance, paid leave programs, other changes in workplace regulation, and compliance with laws regarding public access to our stores, may result in significant added expenses or may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement and/or could materially increase our cost of doing business. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations or untimely or incomplete execution of a required product recall can result in the imposition of penalties, including loss of licenses or significant fines or monetary penalties, class action litigation or other litigation, in addition to reputational damage. Additionally, changes in tax laws, the interpretation of existing laws, or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to protect our brand names, competitors may adopt trade names that dilute the value of these assets.\nWe may be unable or unwilling to strictly enforce our trademarks in each jurisdiction in which we do business. Also, we may not always be able to successfully enforce our trademarks against competitors or against challenges by others. Our failure to successfully protect our trademarks could diminish the value and efficacy of our brand recognition and could cause customer confusion, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on manufacturers in foreign countries for merchandise and a significant amount of our domestically-purchased merchandise is manufactured abroad. Our business may be materially adversely affected by risks associated with international trade.\nWe purchase merchandise directly from suppliers outside of the United States. In 2020, substantially all of our private label inventory purchases were direct imports. Our direct imports represented approximately 20% at cost of our total merchandise purchases in 2020. Additionally, a significant amount of our domestically-purchased merchandise is manufactured abroad. Our ability to identify qualified suppliers and to access products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced outside of North America. Global sourcing and foreign trade involve numerous factors and uncertainties beyond our control, including possible changes to U.S. trade policy, including potential changes in response to the widespread outbreak of COVID-19 (coronavirus), increased shipping costs, the timing of shipments, increased import duties, more restrictive quotas, loss of most favored nation trading status, currency, work stoppages, transportation delays, port of entry issues, economic uncertainties such as inflation, foreign government regulations, political unrest, natural disasters, war, terrorism, trade restrictions, political instability, the financial stability of vendors, merchandise quality issues, unexpected contagion, existing viruses or illnesses, and tariffs. Moreover, negative press or reports about internationally manufactured products may sway public opinion, and thus customer confidence, away from the products sold in our stores. These and other issues affecting our international vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIndex\nWe are subject to governmental regulations, procedures and requirements. A significant change in, or noncompliance with, these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe routinely incur significant costs in complying with federal, state and local laws and regulations. The complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are increasing due to expanding and additional legal and regulatory requirements and increased enforcement efforts. New laws or regulations, including those dealing with healthcare reform, product safety, consumer credit, privacy and information security and labor and employment, among others, or changes in existing federal, state and local laws and regulations, particularly those governing the sale of products and food safety and quality (including changes in labeling or disclosure requirements), federal or state wage requirements, employee rights, health care, social welfare or entitlement programs such as health insurance, paid leave programs, other changes in workplace regulation, and compliance with laws regarding public access to our stores, may result in significant added expenses or may require extensive system and operating changes that may be difficult to implement and/or could materially increase our cost of doing business. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations or untimely or incomplete execution of a required product recall can result in the imposition of penalties, including loss of licenses or significant fines or monetary penalties, class action litigation or other litigation, in addition to reputational damage. Additionally, changes in tax laws, the interpretation of existing laws, or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could materially adversely affect our effective tax rate and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe cost of compliance with product safety regulations and risks related to product liability claims and product recalls could damage our reputation, increase our cost of doing business and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nNew federal or state legislation, including new product safety laws and regulations, may negatively impact our operations. Future changes in product safety legislation or regulations may lead to product recalls and the disposal or write-off of merchandise. While we work to comply in all material respects with applicable legislation and regulations, and to execute product recalls in a timely manner, if our merchandise, including food and consumable products and flooring, does not meet applicable governmental safety standards or our customers\u2019 expectations regarding quality or safety, we could experience lost sales and increased costs, be exposed to legal and reputational risk and face fines or penalties which could materially adversely affect our financial results. We also purchase a material portion of our products on a closeout basis. Some of these products are obtained through brokers or intermediaries rather than through manufacturers. The closeout nature of a portion of our products sometimes makes it more difficult for us to investigate all aspects of these products. Furthermore, customers have asserted claims, and may in the future assert claims, that they have sustained injuries from merchandise offered by us, and we may be subject to lawsuits relating to these claims. There is a risk that these claims may exceed, or fall outside the scope of, our insurance coverage. Even with adequate insurance and indemnification from third-party suppliers, such claims, even if unsuccessful or not fully pursued, could significantly damage our reputation and customer confidence in our products. If this occurs, it may be difficult for us to regain lost sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIndex\nOur current insurance program may expose us to unexpected costs and negatively affect our financial performance.\nOur insurance coverage reflects deductibles, self-insured retentions, limits of liability and similar provisions that we believe are prudent based on the dispersion of our operations. However, there are types of losses we may incur but against which we cannot be insured or which we believe are not economically reasonable to insure, such as losses due to acts of war, employee and certain other crime, wage and hour and certain other employment-related claims, public accommodation claims, class actions, and some natural disasters. If we incur these losses and they are material, our business could suffer. Certain material events may result in sizable losses for the insurance industry and adversely impact the availability of adequate insurance coverage or result in excessive premium increases. To offset negative insurance market trends, we may elect to self-insure, accept higher deductibles or reduce the amount of coverage in response to these market changes. In addition, we self-insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers\u2019 compensation, general liability and group health insurance programs. Unanticipated changes in any applicable actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our recorded liabilities for these losses, including expected increases in medical and indemnity costs, could result in materially different expenses than expected under these programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We continue to maintain property insurance for catastrophic events at our store support center, distribution centers and stores. In addition, because of ongoing changes in healthcare law, among other things, we may experience an increase in participation in our group health insurance programs, which may lead to a greater number of medical claims. While we have coverage for some cyber-related incidents, the nature and scope of any potential attack or breach may result in substantial costs that would exceed the scope of coverage or limits of coverage. If we experience a greater number of these losses than we anticipate, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations\nWe face litigation risks from customers, associates, stockholders and other third parties in the ordinary course of business.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by customers, current and former associates, suppliers, stockholders, intellectual property rights holders, government agencies and others through private actions, class actions, collective actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions, or other litigation. From time to time, such lawsuits are filed against us and the outcome of any litigation, particularly class or collective action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend any such lawsuits may be significant and may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operations are required. There may also be negative publicity associated with litigation that could decrease customer acceptance of merchandise offerings, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nTECHNOLOGY AND CYBERSECURITY\nAny disruptions to our information technology systems or breaches of our network security could disrupt or interrupt our operations, compromise our reputation, expose us to litigation, government enforcement actions and costly response measures and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIndex\nWe rely on the integrity, security and successful functioning of our information technology systems and network infrastructure across our operations, including point-of-sale processing at our stores. In connection with sales, we transmit encrypted confidential credit and debit card information.\nAs of the end of 2020, we are compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (\u201cPCI\u201d) issued by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council. However, there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to operate our facilities and our customer service and sales operations in accordance with PCI or other industry recommended or contractually required practices. We expect to incur additional expenses, and the time and effort of our information technology staff, to maintain PCI compliance. Even though we are compliant with such standards, we still may not be able to prevent or timely detect security breaches.\nAn increasingly significant portion of our sales depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems, including, but not limited to, our point-of-sale system and our credit card processing systems. Our information technology, communication systems and electronic data may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses, ransomware attacks, loss of data, unauthorized data breaches, usage errors by our associates or our contractors or other attempts to harm our systems, including cyber-security attacks or other breaches of cardholder data, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorist attacks, floods, fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, power loss and outages, computer and telecommunications failures. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of intentional sabotage, unauthorized access, natural disaster, or other unanticipated problems could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Any errors or vulnerabilities in our systems, or damage to or failure of our systems, could result in interruptions in our services, non-compliance with certain regulations, substantial remediation costs, and liability for lost or stolen information, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nData protection requirements increase our operating costs and a breach in information privacy or other related risks could negatively impact our operations.\nWe have access to, collect or maintain private or confidential information regarding our customers, associates and suppliers, as well as our business. The protection of our customer, associate, supplier and company data is critical to us. In recent years, there has been increasing regulation, enforcement and litigation activity in the area of privacy, data protection and information security in the United States and in various other countries, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across the many states in which we conduct our business. For example, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) expands the scope of EU data protection law to all foreign companies processing personal data of EU residents and imposes a strict data protection compliance regime with significant monetary penalties. The state of California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA and other state privacy acts have imposed and likely will impose additional data protection obligations on companies considered to be doing business in California and provides for substantial fines for non-compliance and, in some cases, a private right of action to consumers who are victims of data breaches. Complying with the GDPR, the CCPA and similar emerging and changing privacy, data protection and information security requirements may cause us to incur substantial costs or compliance risks due to, among other things, system changes and the development of new processes and business initiatives. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory and/or governmental investigations and/or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions, ongoing regulatory monitoring and customer attrition.\nIn addition, our customers have a high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information from cyber-attack or other security breaches. We have procedures in place to evaluate the integrity of our systems, and to safeguard such data and information. However, the landscape is evolving at a rapid pace, and we may be unable to effectively anticipate or respond to attacks to or breaches of our security systems or implement adequate preventative measures. A breach of customer, employee, supplier, or company data could attract a substantial amount of negative media attention, damage our customer and supplier relationships and our reputation, and result in lost sales, costly fines, other expenses, and/or lawsuits, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIndex\nIf we are unable to maintain or upgrade our information technology systems or if we are unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner, our operations may be disrupted or become less efficient.\nWe depend on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our business. We rely on certain hardware, telecommunications and software vendors to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that we can continue to support our business. Various components of our information technology systems, including hardware, networks and software, are licensed to us by third party vendors. We rely extensively on our information technology systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business. We are in compliance with PCI as of the end of 2020, and compliance with PCI and implementing related procedures, technology and information security measures requires significant resources and ongoing attention. Costs and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology such as those necessary to achieve compliance with PCI or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. Any material interruptions or failures in our payment-related systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our information technology systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to fix or replace them. If there are amendments to PCI, the cost of re-compliance could also be substantial and we may suffer loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our operations as a result. In addition, we may have to upgrade our existing information technology systems from time to time in order for such systems to withstand the increasing needs of our expanding business. Any material interruption experienced by our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Costs and potential interruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of our existing systems could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our business.\nACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our significant accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.\nChanges to accounting rules or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to existing accounting rules or regulations may impact our future results of operations or cause the perception that we are more highly leveraged. Other new accounting rules or regulations and varying interpretations of existing accounting rules or regulations have occurred and may occur in the future. Future changes to accounting rules or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIndex\nRISKS RELATED TO COMMON STOCK AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe estate of our former Chief Executive Officer owns a substantial percentage of our outstanding common stock and the estate\u2019s interests may be different from or conflict with those of our other stockholders.\nAs of April 30, 2020, the estate of Mark Butler, our former Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned approximately 13% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, Mr. Butler\u2019s estate would be able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, a merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and any other significant transaction. Our principal stockholder\u2019s interests might not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders.\nAs a public company, our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act and rules implemented by the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) have imposed various requirements on public companies, including establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices. Implementing and maintaining internal controls is time consuming and costly. If we fail to maintain an effective internal control environment or to comply with the numerous legal and regulatory requirements imposed on public companies, we could make material errors in, and be required to restate, our financial statements. Any such restatement could result in a loss of public confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and sanctions imposed on us by the SEC. If we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and fourth amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and fourth amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and fourth amended and restated bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022 authorize our Board to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 50,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\u2022 subject to certain exceptions, require that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n\u2022 specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by a majority of our Board or upon the request of the Chairperson of the Board or the Chief Executive Officer;\n\u2022 establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our Board;\n\u2022 establish that our Board is divided into three classes until the annual meeting of the stockholders to be held in 2022, with each director serving a one-year term;\n\u2022 prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors; and\n\u2022 provide that vacancies on our Board may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nIndex\nOur third amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could increase costs of bringing a claim, discourage claims, or limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nSpecifically, the certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing in advance to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum, to the fullest extent provided by law, for the following types of actions or proceedings:\n\u2022 any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company;\n\u2022 any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or any wrongdoing by, any director, officer or employee of the Company to the Company or the Company\u2019s stockholders;\n\u2022 any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporate Law, the certification of incorporation (including as it may be amended from time to time), or the fourth amended and restated bylaws;\n\u2022 any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our certificate of incorporation or the fourth amended and restated bylaws; or\n\u2022 any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nApplication of the choice of forum provision may be limited in some instances by law. Section 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (\u201cExchange Act\u201d) provides for exclusive federal court jurisdiction over Exchange Act claims. Accordingly, to the extent the exclusive forum provision is held to cover a shareholder derivative action asserting claims under the Exchange Act, such claims could not be brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery and would instead be within the jurisdiction of the federal district court for the District of Delaware. Section 22 of the Securities Act of 1933 (\u201cSecurities Act\u201d) creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Moreover, our stockholders will not be deemed by operation of our choice of forum provision to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder. It is also possible that, notwithstanding the forum selection clause, a court could rule that such a provision is inapplicable or unenforceable, which could adversely impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nIf securities analysts or industry analysts downgrade our shares, publish negative research or reports or do not publish reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is to some extent influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us, our business and our industry. If no or few analysts commence coverage of us, the trading price of our stock could decrease. Even if we do obtain analyst coverage, if one or more analysts adversely change their recommendation regarding our shares or our competitors\u2019 stock, our share price might decline. If one or more analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we might lose visibility in the financial markets, which, in turn, could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders or upon the exercise of outstanding stock options or grant of stock options or restricted stock units in the future may cause the market price of our common stock to decrease significantly. As of January 30, 2021, we have an aggregate of 1,393,073 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and the vesting of restricted stock units under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201c2015 Plan\u201d and together with the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, the \u201cEquity Plans\u201d) (450,577 of which are fully vested).\nIndex\nThe perception that such sales could occur could also depress the market price of our common stock. Any such sales could also create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and might also make it more difficult for us to raise capital through the sale of equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nOllie\u2019s Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc. (\u201cHoldings\u201d) is a holding company and relies on dividends and other payments, advances and transfers of funds from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations and pay any dividends.\nHoldings has no direct operations and no significant assets other than ownership of 100% of the capital stock of its subsidiaries. Because Holdings conducts operations through subsidiaries, it depends on those entities for dividends and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet financial obligations and to pay any dividends with respect to its common stock. Legal and contractual restrictions in the Credit Facility (defined below) and other agreements which may govern future indebtedness of subsidiaries, as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of subsidiaries, may limit its ability to obtain cash from subsidiaries. The earnings from, or other available assets of, subsidiaries might not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to enable Holdings to pay any dividends on its common stock or other obligations. Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future.\nThe continued operation and expansion of our business will require substantial funding. We do not anticipate that we will pay any dividends to holders of our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any payment of cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend on our financial condition, capital requirements, legal requirements, earnings and other factors. Our ability to pay dividends is restricted by the terms of our Credit Facility and might be restricted by the terms of any indebtedness that we incur in the future. Accordingly, realization of any gain on our common stock will depend on the appreciation of the price of the shares of our common stock, which may never occur.\nINDEBTEDNESS AND CAPITALIZATION\nIndebtedness may limit our ability to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and if we are unable to comply with our financial covenants, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn May 22, 2019, the Company completed a transaction in which it refinanced its credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) which includes a revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d). As of January 30, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings on the Revolving Credit Facility, with $92.0 million of borrowing availability. We may, from time to time, incur additional indebtedness.\nThe agreements governing our Credit Facility place certain conditions on us, including that they:\n\u2022 increase our vulnerability to adverse general economic or industry conditions;\n\u2022 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022 make us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates, as borrowings under our Credit Facility are at variable rates;\n\u2022 limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital or other purposes;\n\u2022 require us to utilize our cash flows from operations to make payments on indebtedness, reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development activity and other general corporate purposes; and\n\u2022 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.\nIndex\nOur Credit Facility places certain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness. However, subject to the qualifications and exceptions in our Credit Facility, we may be permitted to incur substantial additional indebtedness and may incur obligations that do not constitute indebtedness under the terms of the Credit Facility. Our Credit Facility also places certain limitations on, among other things, our ability to enter into certain types of transactions, financing arrangements and investments, to make certain changes to our capital structure and to guarantee certain indebtedness. Our Credit Facility also places certain restrictions on the payment of dividends and distributions and certain management fees. These restrictions limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022 pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our stock or make other distributions;\n\u2022 incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u2022 sell stock in our subsidiaries;\n\u2022 create or incur liens;\n\u2022 make acquisitions or investments;\n\u2022 transfer or sell certain assets or merge or consolidate with or into other companies;\n\u2022 make certain payments or prepayments of indebtedness subordinated to our obligations under our Credit Facility; and\n\u2022 enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nFailure to comply with certain covenants or the occurrence of a change of control under our Credit Facility could result in the acceleration of our obligations under the Credit Facility, which would materially adversely affect our liquidity, capital resources and results of operations.\nUnder certain circumstances, our Credit Facility requires us to comply with certain financial covenants regarding our fixed charge coverage ratio. Failure to comply could result in a default and an acceleration of our obligations under the Credit Facility, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cItem 7, Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Credit Facilities.\u201d\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy debt service obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to make principal and interest payments on and to refinance indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future and is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, in the amounts projected or at all, or if future borrowings are not available to us in amounts sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flows from operations to make scheduled principal and interest payments in the future, we may need to refinance all or a portion of indebtedness on or before maturity, sell assets, delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity. The terms of future debt agreements, including our Credit Facility, may also restrict us from affecting any of these alternatives. Further, changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing, make it more difficult to obtain favorable terms, or restrict our access to these sources of future liquidity. If we are unable to refinance indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all or to effect any other action relating to indebtedness on satisfactory terms or at all, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIndex", "PERMNO": 15535, "SIC": 5331, "TIC": "OLLI"}
