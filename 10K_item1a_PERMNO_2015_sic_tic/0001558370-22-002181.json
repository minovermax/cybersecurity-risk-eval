these estimates.\n\u2022 Changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition.\nStrategic Risks\n\u2022 Geographic concentration in our existing markets may unfavorably impact our operations.\n\u2022 We operate in a highly competitive industry and market area.\n\u2022 New lines of business, products, product enhancements or services may subject us to additional risks.\n\u2022 A change in the key role of dealers within the automotive industry or our ability to maintain or build relationships with them could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects.\n\u2022 We continually encounter technological change.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance

subject to litigation risk pertaining to our fiduciary responsibilities.\nOther Risks Affecting Our Business\n\u2022 The COVID-19 pandemic and measures intended to prevent its spread have adversely affected, and continue to adversely affect, us and our customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers, and the adverse impacts on our business, financial position, results of operations, and prospects could be significant and are difficult to predict.\n\u2022 Severe weather, hurricanes, tsunamis, natural disasters, pandemics, acts of war or terrorism or other external events could significantly impact our business.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\n\u2022 Our stock price may be volatile, and you could lose part or all of your investment as a result.\n\u2022 Future sales and issuances of our common stock, including sales as part of our equity-based compensation plans, could result in dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could lower our stock price.\n\u2022 Certain banking laws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have an anti-takeover effect.\nRisks Related to BNPP\u2019s Divestiture of Our Common Stock\n\u2022 We may be subject to unexpected income tax liabilities in connection with the Reorganization Transactions. BWHI is required to pay us for any unexpected income tax liabilities that arise in connection with the Reorganization Transactions. However, in the event that BWHI does not satisfy its payment obligations, we could be subject to significantly higher federal and/or state and local income tax liabilities than currently anticipated.\nMarket Risks\nOur business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally and in Hawaii, Guam and Saipan in particular.\nWe provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in Hawaii, Guam and Saipan. Our financial performance generally, and the ability of our borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans in particular, as well as demand for loans and other products and services we offer, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets in which we operate. Economic conditions in our markets depend mainly on tourism, U.S. military and defense products and services, real estate, government and other service-based industries. In addition, Hawaii\u2019s economy depends significantly on conditions of the U.S. economy and key international economies, particularly Japan. Declines in the economic conditions in these markets, tourism, fluctuations in the strength of currencies such as the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen, the inability of the Hawaii economy to absorb continuing construction expansion, increases in levels of underemployment, increases in energy costs, and other inflationary conditions, the availability of affordable air transportation, supply chain disruptions, pandemics or other widespread health emergency (or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency) (including COVID-19), real or threatened acts of war or terrorism, adverse weather, natural disasters and local or national budget issues, among other factors, may impact consumer and corporate spending. As a result, these events may contribute to a deterioration in Hawaii\u2019s general economic condition, which, as a result of our geographic concentration, could adversely impact us and our borrowers.\nCommercial lending represents approximately 52% of our total loan and lease portfolio as of December 31, 2021, and we generally make loans to small to mid-sized businesses whose financial performance depends on the regional economy. These businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities and may expose us to greater credit risks. We also engage in mortgage lending and automobile financing, as well as other forms of consumer lending. Adverse economic and business conditions in our market areas could reduce our growth rate, affect our borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans or the value of the collateral underlying their loans and, consequently, adversely affect our financial condition and performance.\nThe U.S. military has a major presence in Hawaii and Guam and, as a result, is an important aspect of the economies in which we operate. The funding of the U.S. military occurs as part of the overall U.S. government budget and appropriation process which is driven by numerous factors, including geopolitical events, macroeconomic conditions and the ability of the U.S. government to enact legislation such as appropriations bills. Cuts to defense and other security spending could have an adverse impact on the economy in our markets.\nOther economic conditions that affect our financial performance include short-term and long-term interest rates, the prevailing yield curve, inflation and price levels (particularly for real estate), monetary policy, unemployment and the strength of the domestic economy as a whole. Unfavorable market conditions can result in a deterioration in the credit quality of our borrowers and the demand for our products and services, an increase in the number of loan delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs, additional provisions for loan losses, adverse asset values and an overall material adverse effect on the quality of our loan portfolio. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence, limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital, increases in inflation or interest rates, high unemployment, natural disasters or a combination of these or other factors. While recent economic conditions in the State of Hawaii, the United States and worldwide have seen improving trends since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurance that this improvement will continue. Evolving responses from federal and state governments and other regulators, and our customers or our third-party partners or vendors, to new challenges such as climate change have impacted and could continue to impact the economic and political conditions under which we operate. Economic and inflationary pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding continuing economic improvement could result in changes in consumer and business spending, borrowing and savings habits. Such conditions could have a material adverse effect on the credit quality of our loans and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA sustained period of high inflation could pose a risk to the economy and the financial performance of the Bank.\nA sustained period of inflation could impact the Bank in many ways. Higher cost could reduce our profit margins. Aggressive action by monetary authorities to combat inflation could lead to higher rates which could negatively affect economic growth. Higher rates could make less creditworthy customers less able to meet their payment obligations. Higher rates could also lead to reduced valuations on long duration financial assets and real estate and impact the value of collateral pledged for loans. Finally, higher rates could result in deposit outflows or higher deposit costs.\nOur business is significantly dependent on the real estate markets in which we operate, as a significant percentage of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our real estate loans represented approximately $9.4 billion, or 73% of our total loan and lease portfolio. Our real estate loans consist primarily of residential loans, including home equity loans (representing 38% of our total loan and lease portfolio) and commercial and construction loans (representing 35% of our total loan and lease portfolio), with the significant majority of these loans concentrated in Hawaii. Real property values in Hawaii may be affected by a variety of factors outside of our control and the control of our borrowers, including national and local economic conditions generally. Declines in real property prices, including prices for homes and commercial properties, in Hawaii, Guam or Saipan could result in a deterioration of the credit quality of our borrowers, an increase in the number of loan delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs, and reduced demand for our products and services generally.\nIn addition, nearly all residential mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit and loans outstanding are for residences located in Hawaii, Guam or Saipan. These island locales are susceptible to a wide array of potential natural disasters including, but not limited to, hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and tsunamis, like the October 2018 super typhoon that struck Saipan causing material damage to the island. Finally, declines in real property values in the areas in which we operate, particularly Hawaii, whether as a result of these or other factors, could result in a deterioration of the credit quality of our borrowers, an increase in the number of loan delinquencies, defaults and charge-offs, and reduced demand for our products and services generally. Additionally, such declines in in real property values could reduce the value of any collateral we realize following a default on these loans and could adversely affect our ability to continue to grow our loan portfolio consistent with our underwriting standards. Our failure to mitigate these risks effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business is subject to risk arising from conditions in the commercial real estate market.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our commercial real estate loans represented approximately $3.6 billion or 28% of our total loan and lease portfolio. Commercial real estate loans may have a greater risk of loss than residential mortgage loans, in part because these loans are generally larger or more complex to underwrite and are characterized by having a limited supply of real estate at commercially attractive locations, long delivery time frames for development and high interest rate sensitivity. As payments on loans secured by commercial real estate often depend upon the successful operation and management of the properties and the businesses which operate from within them, repayment of such loans may be affected by factors outside the borrower\u2019s control, such as adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy or changes in government regulation. In recent years, commercial real estate markets have been experiencing substantial growth, and increased competitive pressures have contributed significantly to historically low capitalization rates and rising property values. Commercial real estate markets have been particularly impacted by the economic disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, federal banking regulatory agencies have expressed concerns about weaknesses in the current commercial real estate market. Our failure to adequately implement risk management policies, procedures and controls could adversely affect our ability to increase this portfolio going forward and could result in an increased rate of delinquencies in, and increased losses from, this portfolio.\nConcentrated exposures to certain asset classes and individual obligors may unfavorably impact our operations.\nWe have naturally developed concentrated exposures to those asset classes and industries in which we have specific knowledge or competency, such as commercial real estate lending and dealer financing. In management\u2019s judgment, our extensive experience within these concentration areas, and our strategic relationships within such areas, allows us to better evaluate the associated risks and price credit accordingly. However, the presence of similar exposures concentrated in certain asset classes leaves us exposed to the risk of a focused downturn or increased competitive pressures within a concentration area. Additionally, we have cultivated relationships with market leaders that result in relatively larger exposures to select single obligors than would be typical for an institution of our size in a larger operating market. For example, our top five dealer relationships represented approximately 33% of our outstanding dealer flooring commitments as of December 31, 2021. The failure to properly anticipate and address risks associated with these concentrated exposures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business is subject to interest rate risk and fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings.\nFluctuations in interest rates may negatively impact our banking business and may weaken demand for some of our products. Our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we receive from interest-earning assets (e.g., loans and investment securities) and the interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities (e.g., deposits and borrowings). The level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of interest-earning assets, the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities. These factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rates are volatile and highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, such as economic conditions, inflationary trends, changes in government spending and debt issuances and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, and, in particular the monetary policy of the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve System (the \u201cFOMC\u201d). In recent years, it has been the policy of the FOMC and the U.S. Treasury Department to maintain interest rates at historically low levels through a targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities.\nSome foreign central banks have moved to a negative interest rate environment, which has exerted downward pressure on the profitability of banks in those regions and this interest rate trend could extend to the United States. In the event that interest rates continue to decrease, or remain at low levels for a sustained period of time, our net interest income could be adversely affected. If our net interest income decreases, this could have an adverse effect on our profitability and the value of our investments.\nChanges in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but also our ability to originate loans and deposits. Changes in interest rates also have a significant impact on (i) the carrying value of certain assets, including loans, real estate and investment securities, on our balance sheet, and (ii) the level of loan refinancing activity in our portfolio, which impacts the amount of prepayment penalty income we receive on loans we hold. In addition, we may incur debt in the future, and that debt may also be sensitive to interest rates.\nThe cost of our deposits is largely based on short-term interest rates, the level of which is driven primarily by the FOMC\u2019s actions. However, the yields generated by our loans and securities are often difficult to re-price and are typically driven by longer-term interest rates, which are set by the market or, at times, the FOMC\u2019s actions, and vary over time. The level of net interest income is therefore influenced by movements in such interest rates and the pace at which such movements occur. If the interest rates paid on our deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our loans and other investments, our net interest income may decline and, with it, a decline in our earnings may occur. Our net interest income and earnings would be similarly affected if the interest rates on our interest-earning assets declined at a faster pace than the interest rates on our deposits and other borrowings. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $9.4 billion of noninterest-bearing demand deposits and $12.4 billion of interest-bearing deposits. If market conditions were to change, including as a result of monetary policy or the competitive environment, in a manner that caused us to offer higher interest rates on checking accounts to maintain current clients or attract new clients, our interest expense will increase, perhaps materially. Furthermore, if we fail to offer interest in a sufficient amount to keep these demand deposits, our core deposits may be reduced, which would require us to obtain funding in other ways or risk slowing our future asset growth.\nCertain of our businesses, our funding and financial products may be adversely affected by changes or the discontinuance of LIBOR.\nOur floating-rate funding, certain hedging transactions and certain of the products that we offer, such as floating-rate loans and mortgages, determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate, such as LIBOR, or to an index, currency, basket or other financial metric. LIBOR and certain other benchmark rates are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. The United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has announced that publication of the most commonly used U.S. Dollar LIBOR settings will cease to be provided or cease to be representative after June 30, 2023. The publication of all other LIBOR settings ceased to be provided or ceased to be representative as of December 31, 2021. The U.S. federal banking agencies have issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using the U.S. Dollar LIBOR as a reference rate in \u201cnew\u201d contracts by December 31, 2021 at the latest. Because the transition from LIBOR is ongoing, there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to the effect of the transition on the financial markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments.\nIn April 2018, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York commenced publication of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), which has been recommended as an alternative to United States dollar LIBOR by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a group of market and official sector participants. However, uncertainty remains as to the transition process and acceptance of SOFR as the primary alternative to LIBOR.\nThe market transition from LIBOR to SOFR or a different alternative reference rate is complex and could have a range of adverse impacts on the Company. In particular, any such transition or reform could, among other things, (i) adversely impact the value of, return on and trading for the Company\u2019s financial assets or liabilities that are linked to LIBOR, including its securities, loans and derivatives; (ii) require renegotiations of outstanding financial assets and liabilities; (iii) result in additional inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of the Company\u2019s preparation and readiness for the LIBOR transition; (iv) increase the risk of disputes or litigation and/or increase expenses related to the transition, including with respect to any actions resulting from the Company\u2019s interpretation and execution of its roles and responsibilities in corporate trust transactions; (v) adversely impact the Company\u2019s reputation as it works with customers to transition loans and financial instruments from LIBOR; (vi) require successful system and analytics development and operationalization to transition the Company\u2019s systems, loan portfolio and risk management processes away from LIBOR, which will require the Company to rely on the readiness of its customers, counterparties and third-party vendors; and (vii) cause significant disruption to financial markets that are relevant to the Company\u2019s business segments. In addition, there can be no assurance that actions taken by the Company and third parties to address these risks and otherwise prepare for the transition from LIBOR to alternative interest rate benchmarks will be successful.\nThe value of the investment securities we own may decline in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we owned investment securities with a fair market value of $8.4 billion, which largely consisted of our positions in obligations of the U.S. government and government-sponsored enterprises. We evaluate our investment securities on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic and market conditions warrant such an evaluation. For available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position, we assess whether we intend to sell, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the security\u2019s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers, we may be required to recognize losses in future periods, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nCredit Risks\nOur business, profitability and liquidity may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of, or defaults by, third parties who owe us money, securities or other assets or whose securities or obligations we hold.\nA number of our products expose us to credit risk. We are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money, securities or other assets will not perform their obligations. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. A failure of a significant market participant, or even concerns about a default by such an institution, could lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by other institutions, which in turn could adversely affect us.\nWe are also subject to the risk that our rights against third parties may not be enforceable in all circumstances or that there is a deterioration in the credit quality of third parties whose securities or obligations we hold, including a deterioration in the value of collateral posted by third parties to secure their obligations to us under derivatives contracts and loan agreements. A deterioration in credit quality of such obligors, could result in losses and/or adversely affect our ability to rehypothecate or otherwise use those securities or obligations for liquidity purposes.\nWe might underestimate the credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio and have credit losses in excess of the amount we reserve for loan and lease losses.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses ( \u201cACL\u201d), which is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses (the \u201cProvision\u201d) charged to expense representing management\u2019s best estimate of inherent losses within our existing portfolio of loans and leases. The level of the ACL reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of specific credit risks, the quality of the loan and lease portfolio, the value of the underlying collateral, the level of non-accruing loans and leases, the unidentified losses inherent in the current loan and lease portfolio, and economic, political and regulatory conditions.\nFor our commercial loans, we perform an internal loan review and grade loans on an ongoing basis, and we estimate and establish reserves for credit risks and credit losses inherent in our credit exposure (including unfunded lending commitments). The objective of our loan review and grading procedures is to identify existing or emerging credit quality problems so that appropriate steps can be initiated to avoid or minimize future losses. This process, which is critical to our financial results and condition, requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments of loan collectibility, including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic predictions might impair the ability of the Company\u2019s borrowers to repay their loans. The Company may not be able to accurately predict these economic conditions and/or some or all of their effects, which may, in turn, negatively impact the reliability of the process. Accordingly, as is the case with any such assessments, there is always the chance that we will fail to identify the proper factors or that we will fail to accurately estimate the impacts of factors that we identify.\nAlthough our management has established an ACL it believes is adequate, we could sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the amount of our ACL. Higher credit losses could arise for a variety of reasons, such as growth in our loan and lease portfolio, changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding our loans and leases and other factors within and outside our control. If real estate values were to decline or if economic conditions in our markets were to deteriorate unexpectedly, additional loan and lease losses not incorporated in the existing ACL might occur. Losses in excess of the existing ACL will reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. A severe downturn in the economy generally, in our markets specifically or affecting the business and assets of individual customers would generate increased charge-offs and a need for higher reserves. While we believe that our ACL was adequate as of December 31, 2021, there is no assurance that it will be sufficient to cover all incurred credit losses. In the event of significant deterioration in economic conditions, we may be required to increase reserves in future periods, which would reduce our earnings.\nBank regulatory agencies will periodically review our ACL and the value attributed to non-accrual loans and leases or to real estate we acquire through foreclosure. Such regulatory agencies may require us to adjust our determination of the value for these items, increase our ACL or reduce the carrying value of owned real estate, reducing our net income. Further, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the ACL, we may need additional adjustments to increase the ACL. These adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nLiquidity Risks\nLoss of deposits could increase our funding costs.\nLike many banking companies, we rely on customer deposits to meet a considerable portion of our funding, and we continue to seek customer deposits to maintain this funding base. We accept deposits directly from consumer and commercial customers and, as of December 31, 2021, we had $21.8 billion in deposits. Deposits are subject to potentially dramatic fluctuations in availability or price due to certain factors outside our control, such as a loss of confidence by customers in us or the banking sector generally, customer perceptions of our financial health and general reputation, increasing competitive pressures from other financial services firms for consumer or corporate customer deposits, changes in interest rates and returns on other investment classes, which could result in significant outflows of deposits within short periods of time or significant changes in pricing necessary to maintain current customer deposits or attract additional deposits. In addition, if the Company\u2019s competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits, the Company\u2019s funding costs may increase, either because the Company raises its rates to avoid losing deposits or because the Company loses deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. Higher funding costs could reduce the Company\u2019s net interest margin and net interest income and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur liquidity is dependent on dividends from First Hawaiian Bank.\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from our banking and other subsidiaries. Dividends from the Bank provide virtually all of our cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends on our common stock and principal and interest on any debt we may incur. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that our bank may pay to us. For example, Hawaii law only permits our bank to pay dividends out of retained earnings as defined under Hawaii banking law, which differs from retained earnings calculated under GAAP. Also, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service any debt we may incur, pay obligations or pay dividends on our common stock. The inability to receive dividends from the Bank could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, and such capital may not be available when needed or at all.\nWe may need to raise additional capital, in the form of additional debt or equity, in the future to have sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and fund our business needs and future growth, particularly if the quality of our assets or earnings were to deteriorate significantly. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and our financial condition. Economic conditions and a loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase our cost of funding and limit access to certain customary sources of capital, including inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the Federal Reserve System. We may not be able to obtain capital on acceptable terms - or at all. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers, depositors of our bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets or other disruption in capital markets, may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. Further, if we need to raise capital in the future, we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would then have to compete with those institutions for investors. An inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOperational Risks\nOur ability to maintain, attract and retain customer relationships is highly dependent on our reputation.\nAs the parent company of Hawaii\u2019s oldest and largest bank, we rely in part on our bank\u2019s reputation for superior financial services to retain our customer relationships. Damage to our reputation could undermine the confidence of our current and potential customers in our ability to provide high-quality financial services. Such damage could also impair the confidence of our counterparties and vendors and ultimately affect our ability to effect transactions. Maintenance of our reputation depends not only on our success in maintaining our service-focused culture and controlling and mitigating the various risks described in this Form 10-K, but also on our success in identifying and appropriately addressing issues that may arise in areas such as potential conflicts of interest, anti-money laundering, customer personal information and privacy issues, customer and other third party fraud, record-keeping, regulatory investigations and any litigation that may arise from any failure or perceived failure on our part to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. Maintaining our reputation also depends on our ability to successfully prevent third parties from infringing on the \u201cFirst Hawaiian Bank\u201d brand and associated trademarks and our other intellectual property. Defense of our reputation, trademarks and other intellectual property, including through litigation, could result in costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain key personnel and other skilled employees.\nOur success depends, in large part, on the skills of our management team and our ability to retain, recruit and motivate key officers and employees. Competition for qualified employees and personnel in the financial services and banking industry is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of, and experience in, the regional banking industry, especially in the communities served by our branch network. A substantial number of our employees have considerable tenure with the Bank and some will be nearing retirement in the next few years, which makes succession planning important to the continued operation of our business. We need to continue to attract and retain key personnel and to recruit qualified individuals to succeed existing key personnel to ensure the continued growth and successful operation of our business. Leadership changes will occur from time to time, and we cannot predict whether significant retirements or resignations will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. The cost of hiring, incentivizing and retaining skilled personnel may continue to increase, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, our ability to effectively compete for senior executives and other qualified personnel by offering competitive compensation and benefit arrangements may be restricted by applicable banking laws and regulations, including any restrictions that may in the future be adopted by U.S. regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve and FDIC. The loss of the services of any senior executive or other key personnel, the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future or the failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf our techniques for managing risk are ineffective, we may be exposed to material unanticipated losses.\nIn order to manage the significant risks inherent in our business, we must maintain effective policies, procedures and systems that enable us to identify, monitor and control our exposure to material risks, such as credit, operational, legal and reputational risks. Our risk management methods may prove to be ineffective due to their design, their implementation or the degree to which we adhere to them, or as a result of the lack of adequate, accurate or timely information or otherwise. If our risk management efforts are ineffective, we could suffer losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we could be subject to litigation, particularly from our customers, and sanctions or fines from regulators. Our techniques for managing the risks we face may not fully mitigate the risk exposure in all economic or market environments, including exposure to risks that we might fail to identify or anticipate.\nWe are dependent on the use of data and modeling both in our management decision-making generally and in meeting regulatory expectations in particular.\nThe use of statistical and quantitative models and other quantitatively-based analyses is central to bank decision-making and regulatory compliance processes, and the employment of such analyses is becoming increasingly widespread in our operations. Liquidity stress testing, interest rate sensitivity analysis, the automated extension of credit based on defined criteria and the identification of possible violations of anti-money laundering regulations are all examples of areas in which we are dependent on models and the data that underlies them. We anticipate that model-derived insights will penetrate further into bank decision-making, and particularly risk management efforts, as the capacities developed to meet rigorous stress testing requirements are able to be employed more widely. While these quantitative techniques and approaches improve our decision-making, they also create the possibility that faulty data or flawed quantitative approaches could yield adverse outcomes or regulatory scrutiny. Additionally, because of the complexity inherent in these approaches, misunderstanding or misuse of their outputs could similarly result in suboptimal decision-making.\nThe appraisals and other valuation techniques we use in evaluating and monitoring loans secured by real property, OREO and repossessed personal property may not accurately describe the net value of the asset.\nIn considering whether to make a loan secured by real property, we generally require an appraisal of the property. However, an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made, and, as real estate values may change significantly in value in relatively short periods of time (especially in periods of heightened economic uncertainty), this estimate may not accurately describe the net value of the real property collateral after the loan is made. As a result, we may not be able to realize the full amount of any remaining indebtedness when we foreclose on and sell the relevant property. In addition, we rely on appraisals and other valuation techniques to establish the value of our OREO and personal property that we acquire through foreclosure proceedings and to determine certain loan impairments. If any of these valuations are inaccurate, our consolidated financial statements may not reflect the correct value of our OREO, and our allowance for credit losses may not reflect accurate loan impairments. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe occurrence of fraudulent activity, breaches or failures of our information security controls or cybersecurity-related incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAs a financial institution, we are susceptible to fraudulent activity, information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents that may be committed against us or our clients, which may result in financial losses or increased costs to us or our clients, disclosure or misuse of our information or our client information, misappropriation of assets, privacy breaches against our clients, litigation or damage to our reputation. Such fraudulent activity may take many forms, including check fraud, electronic fraud, wire fraud, phishing, social engineering and other dishonest acts. Information security breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents may include fraudulent or unauthorized access to systems used by us or our clients, denial or degradation of service attacks, and malware or other cyberattacks. In recent periods, several large corporations, including financial institutions and retail companies, have suffered major data breaches, in some cases exposing not only confidential and proprietary corporate information, but also sensitive financial and other personal information of their customers and employees and subjecting them to potentially fraudulent activity. Some of our clients may have been affected by these breaches, which increase their risks of identity theft, credit card fraud and other fraudulent activity that could involve their accounts with us. We are regularly the target of attempted electronic fraudulent activity, security breaches and cybersecurity-related attacks. Consistent with industry trends, we may face an increasing number of attempted cyberattacks as we expand our mobile and other internet-based products and services, and we provide more of these services to a greater number of individual customers. The increased use of mobile and cloud technologies can heighten these and other operational risks.\nWe also face risks related to cyberattacks and other security breaches in connection with credit card transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding our customers through various third parties, including merchant acquiring banks, payment processors, payment card networks and our processors. Some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyberattacks, and because the transactions involve third parties and environments such as the point of sale that we do not control or secure, future security breaches or cyberattacks affecting any of these third parties could impact us through no fault of our own, and in some cases we may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks relating to them.\nInformation pertaining to us and our customers is maintained, and transactions are executed, on networks and systems maintained by us, our customers and certain of our third-party partners, such as our online banking or reporting systems. The secure maintenance and transmission of confidential information, as well as execution of transactions over these systems, are essential to protect us and our customers against fraud and security breaches and to maintain our customers\u2019 confidence. Breaches of information security also may occur, and in infrequent cases, have occurred through intentional or unintentional acts by those having access to our systems or our customers\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential information, including employees. In addition, increases in criminal activity levels and sophistication, advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, vulnerabilities in third-party technologies (including browsers and operating systems) or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology, processes and controls that we use to prevent fraudulent transactions and to protect data about us, our customers and underlying transactions, as well as the technology used by our customers to access our systems. Although we have developed, and continue to invest in, systems and processes that are designed to detect and prevent security breaches and cyberattacks and periodically test our security, our inability to anticipate, or failure to adequately mitigate, breaches of security could result in: losses to us or our customers; our loss of business and/or customers; damage to our reputation; the incurrence of additional expenses; disruption to our business; our inability to grow our online services or other businesses; additional regulatory scrutiny or penalties; or our exposure to civil litigation and possible financial liability - any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, we may not be able to ensure that our third-party vendors have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information they receive from us and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected by a material breach of, or disruption to, the security of any of our or our vendors\u2019 systems.\nMore generally, publicized information concerning security and cyber-related problems could inhibit the use or growth of electronic or web-based applications or solutions as a means of conducting commercial transactions. Such publicity may also cause damage to our reputation as a financial institution. As a result, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nEmployee misconduct or mistakes could expose us to significant legal liability and reputational harm.\nWe are vulnerable to reputational harm because we operate in an industry in which integrity and the confidence of our customers are of critical importance. Our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. For example, if an employee were to engage in fraudulent, illegal or suspicious activities, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation (as a consequence of the negative perception resulting from such activities), financial position, customer relationships and ability to attract new customers. Our business often requires that we deal with confidential information. If our employees were to improperly use or disclose this information, even if inadvertently, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial position and current and future business relationships. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not always be effective. Misconduct by our employees, or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, employee errors, such as inadvertent use or disclosure of confidential information, calculation errors, mistakes in addressing communications or data inputs, errors in developing, implementing or applying information technology systems or simple errors in judgment, could also have similar adverse effects.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in the actual or perceived soundness or condition of other financial institutions.\nFinancial services institutions may be interconnected as a result of trading, investment, liquidity management, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. Within the financial services industry, loss of public confidence, including through default by any one institution, could lead to liquidity challenges or to defaults by other institutions. Concerns about, or a default by, one institution could lead to significant liquidity problems and losses or defaults by other institutions, as the commercial and financial soundness of many financial institutions is closely related as a result of these credit, trading, clearing and other relationships. Even the perceived lack of creditworthiness of, or questions about, a counterparty may lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by various institutions. This systemic risk may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, banks and exchanges with which we interact on a daily basis or key funding providers such as the Federal Home Loan Banks (\u201cFHLB\u201d), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nConsumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process could materially affect our ability as a creditor to obtain remedies.\nIn 2011, Hawaii revised its rules for nonjudicial, or out-of-court, foreclosures. Prior to the revision, most lenders used the nonjudicial foreclosure method to handle foreclosures in Hawaii, as the process was less expensive and quicker than going through the court foreclosure process. After the revised rules went into effect, many lenders ended up forgoing nonjudicial foreclosures entirely and filing all foreclosures in court, which has created a backlog and slowed the judicial foreclosure process. Many lenders in Hawaii exclusively use the judicial foreclosure process, making the foreclosure process very lengthy. Following a joint federal-state settlement regarding foreclosure practices, mortgage servicers have implemented new programs to assist borrowers with loss mitigation options. Federal and state loss mitigation requirements are now part of our annual audit requirements.\nWe are subject to a variety of risks in connection with any sale of loans we may conduct.\nWhen we sell mortgage loans, we are required to make customary representations and warranties to the purchaser about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated and serviced. If any of these representations and warranties are incorrect, we may be required to indemnify the purchaser for any related losses, or we may be required to repurchase or provide substitute mortgage loans for part or all of the affected loans. We may also be required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default by the borrower on a loan we have sold. If the level of repurchase and indemnity activity becomes material, it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, business, financial condition or results of operations. Mortgage lending is highly regulated. Our inability to comply with all federal and state regulations and investor guidelines regarding the origination, underwriting documentation and servicing of mortgage loans may impact our ability to sell mortgage loans in the future.\nIn addition, we must report as held for sale any loans which we have undertaken to sell, whether or not a purchase agreement for the loans has been executed. We may therefore be unable to ultimately complete a sale for part or all of the loans we classify as held for sale. We must exercise our judgment in determining when loans must be reclassified from held for investment status to held for sale status under applicable accounting guidelines. Any failure to accurately report loans as held for sale could result in regulatory investigations and monetary penalties. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our policy is to carry loans held for sale at the lower of cost or fair value. As a result, prior to being sold, any loans classified as held for sale may be adversely affected by market conditions, including changes in interest rates, and by changes in the borrower\u2019s creditworthiness, and the value associated with these loans, including any loans originated for sale in the secondary market, may decline prior to being sold. We may be required to reduce the value of any loans we mark held for sale as a result, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations could be interrupted if certain external vendors on which we rely experience difficulty, terminate their services or fail to comply with banking laws and regulations.\nWe depend, to a significant extent, on relationships with third-party service providers that provide services, primarily information technology services, that are critical to our operations. We utilize third-party core banking services and receive credit card and debit card services, Internet banking services, various information services and services complementary to our banking products from various third-party service providers. We are also exposed to the risk that a cyberattack, security breach or other information technology incident at a common vendor to our third-party service providers could impede their ability to provide services to us. We may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational risks relating to the use of common vendors by third-party service providers. If any of our third-party service providers experience difficulties or terminate their services and we are unable to replace our service providers with other service providers, our operations could be interrupted. It may be difficult for us to replace some of our third-party vendors, particularly vendors providing our core banking, credit card and debit card services and information services, in a timely manner if they are unwilling or unable to provide us with these services in the future for any reason. If an interruption were to continue for a significant period of time, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Even if we are able to replace them, it may be at higher cost to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if a third-party provider fails to provide the services we require, fails to meet contractual requirements, such as compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or suffers a cyberattack or other security breach, our business could suffer economic and reputational harm that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions, and in evaluating and monitoring our loan portfolio on an ongoing basis, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements, credit reports and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of those customers or counterparties or of other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information. Reliance on inaccurate, incomplete, fraudulent or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other financial or business information, or the failure to receive such information on a timely basis, could result in loan losses, reputational damage or other effects that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur accounting estimates and risk management processes and controls rely on analytical and forecasting techniques and models and assumptions, and actual results may differ from these estimates.\nOur accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with GAAP and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet which may result in our reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nCertain accounting policies are critical to presenting our financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain. Materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates. These critical accounting policies include the allowance for credit losses, goodwill, fair value measurements, pension and postretirement benefit obligations and income taxes. Because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters, we may be required to do one or more of the following: significantly increase the allowance for credit losses or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the reserve provided; record an impairment on all or a portion of our goodwill balance; reduce the carrying value of an asset measured at fair value; or significantly increase our accrued tax liability. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies\u201d for more information.\nOur internal controls, disclosure controls, processes and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures are based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable (not absolute) assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls, processes and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls, processes and procedures could necessitate changes in those controls, processes and procedures, which may increase our compliance costs, divert management\u2019s attention from our business or subject us to regulatory actions and increased regulatory scrutiny. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition.\nFrom time to time, the FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. As a result of changes to financial accounting or reporting standards, whether required by the FASB or other regulators, we could be required to change certain of the assumptions or estimates we have previously used in preparing our financial statements, which could negatively impact how we record and report our results of operations and financial condition generally. For a discussion of the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not adopted by us as of December 31, 2021, see \u201cNote 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for more information.\nStrategic Risks\nGeographic concentration in our existing markets may unfavorably impact our operations.\nA substantial majority of our business is with customers located within Hawaii. Our operations are heavily concentrated in Hawaii, as well as in Guam and Saipan. As a result of this geographic concentration, our results depend largely on economic conditions in these and surrounding areas. As discussed below, deterioration in economic conditions in Hawaii, Guam and Saipan would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, continued, long-term growth may be unsustainable, given the concentration of our operations and customer base in Hawaii, Guam and Saipan. Moreover, under applicable laws, we may not be permitted to acquire any bank in Hawaii because we control more than 30% of the total amount of deposits in the Hawaii market. As a result, any further growth in the Hawaii market will most likely have to occur organically rather than by acquisition. Our inability to manage our growth successfully or to continue to expand into new markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and market area.\nWe operate in the highly competitive financial services industry and face significant competition for customers from financial institutions located both within and beyond our principal markets. We compete with commercial banks, savings banks, credit unions, non-bank financial services companies and other financial institutions operating within or near the areas we serve. Additionally, certain large banks headquartered on the U.S. mainland and large community banking institutions target the same customers we do. In addition, as customer preferences and expectations continue to evolve, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the Internet and for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. The banking industry is experiencing rapid changes in technology, and, as a result, our future success will depend in part on our ability to address our customers\u2019 needs by using technology. Customer loyalty can be influenced by a competitor\u2019s new products, especially offerings that could provide cost savings or a higher return to the customer. Increased lending activity of competing banks following the Great Recession (which we define as January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009) has also led to increased competitive pressures on loan rates and terms for high-quality credits. We may not be able to compete successfully with other financial institutions in our markets, and we may have to pay higher interest rates to attract deposits, accept lower yields to attract loans and pay higher wages for new employees, resulting in lower net interest margins and reduced profitability.\nMany of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern our activities and may have greater flexibility in competing for business. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. In addition, some of our current commercial banking customers may seek alternative banking sources as they develop needs for credit facilities larger than we may be able to accommodate. Our inability to compete successfully in the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nNew lines of business, products, product enhancements or services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and product enhancements as well as new services within our existing lines of business. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In implementing, developing or marketing new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services, we may invest significant time and resources, although we may not assign the appropriate level of resources or expertise necessary to make these new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services successful or to realize their expected benefits. Further, initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the ultimate implementation of a new line of business or offerings of new products, product enhancements or services. Furthermore, any new line of business, product, product enhancement or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or offerings of new products, product enhancements or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have dealer-centric automotive finance businesses, and a change in the key role of dealers within the automotive industry or our ability to maintain or build relationships with them could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects.\nOur automotive finance business depends on the continuation of the key role of dealers within the automotive industry, the maintenance of our existing relationships with dealers, and our creation of new relationships with dealers. A number of trends are affecting the automotive industry and the role of dealers within it. These include challenges to the dealer\u2019s role as intermediary between manufacturers and purchasers, shifting financial and other pressures exerted by manufacturers on dealers, the rise of vehicle sharing and ride hailing, the development of autonomous and alternative-energy vehicles, the impact of demographic shifts on attitudes and behaviors toward vehicle ownership and use, changing expectations around the vehicle buying experience, adjustments in the geographic distribution of new and used vehicle sales, and advancements in communications technology. While it is not currently clear how and how quickly these trends may develop, any one or more of them could adversely affect the key role of dealers and their business models, profitability, and viability, and if this were to occur, our dealer-centric automotive finance businesses could suffer as well.\nOur share of commercial wholesale financing remains at risk of decreasing in the future as a result of intense competition and other factors. If we are not able to maintain existing relationships with significant automotive dealers or if we are not able to develop new relationships for any reason-including if we are not able to provide services on a timely basis, offer products and services that meet the needs of the dealers, compete successfully with the products and services of our competitors, or effectively counter the influence that captive automotive finance companies have in the marketplace or the exclusivity privileges that some competitors have with automotive manufacturers-our wholesale funding volumes, and the number of dealers with whom we have funding relationships, could decline in the future. If this were to occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe continually encounter technological change.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new, technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. For instance, we are in the process of implementing a new core system, which is expected to be completed in 2022. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we do. We may not be able to effectively implement new, technology-driven products and services or implement them as quickly as our competitors do or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. In addition, the implementation of technological changes and upgrades to maintain current systems and integrate new systems may also cause service interruptions, transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and may cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws or may otherwise result in an increase, potentially a material increase, in our expenses. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry and failure to avoid interruptions, errors and delays could cause us to lose customers or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe expect that new technologies and business processes applicable to the consumer credit industry will continue to emerge, and these new technologies and business processes may be better than those we currently use. Because the pace of technological change is high and our industry is intensely competitive, we may not be able to sustain our investment in new technology as critical systems and applications become obsolete or as better ones become available. A failure to maintain current technology and business processes could cause disruptions in our operations or cause our products and services to be less competitive, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nLegal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nThe banking industry is highly regulated, and the regulatory framework, together with any future legislative or regulatory changes, may have a significant adverse effect on our operations.\nThe banking industry is extensively regulated and supervised under both federal and state laws and regulations that are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, customers, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not for the protection of our stockholders and creditors other than insured depositors. FHI is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve and the Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the FDIC, the CFPB and the Hawaii DFI. The laws and regulations applicable to us govern a variety of matters, including permissible types, amounts and terms of loans and investments we may make, the maximum interest rate that may be charged, the amount of reserves we must hold against deposits we take, the types of deposits we may accept, maintenance of adequate capital and liquidity, changes in the control of us and our bank, restrictions on dividends and establishment of new offices. We must obtain approval from our regulators before engaging in certain activities, and there is the risk that such approvals may not be obtained, either in a timely manner or at all. Our regulators also have the ability to compel us to take, or restrict us from taking, certain actions entirely, such as actions that our regulators deem to constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, or regulatory policies and interpretations of such laws and regulations, could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties or damage to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe expect that our business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision and that the level of scrutiny and the enforcement environment may fluctuate over time, based on numerous factors, including changes in the United States presidential administration or one or both houses of Congress and public sentiment regarding financial institutions. New regulations and modifications to existing regulations and supervisory expectations have increased, and may in the future increase, our costs over time, result in decreased revenues and net income, reduce our ability to compete effectively (particularly with non-bank financial institutions that may not be subject to the same laws and regulations), make it less attractive for us to continue providing certain products and services, or require changes to our existing regulatory compliance and risk management structure. Any future changes in federal and state law and regulations, as well as the interpretations and implementations, or modifications or repeals, of such laws and regulations, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including those listed above or other ways that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength for our bank in times of stress.\nUnder federal law, we are required to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to our bank, and to commit resources to support our bank if necessary. We may be required to commit additional resources to our bank at times when we may not be in a financial position to provide such resources or when it may not be in our, or our stockholders\u2019 or our creditors\u2019 best interests to do so. Providing such support is more likely during times of financial stress for us and our bank, which may make any capital we are required to raise to provide such support more expensive than it might otherwise be. In addition, any capital loans we make to our bank are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of our bank. In the event of our bankruptcy, any commitment by us to a federal banking regulator to maintain the capital of our bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.\nWe are subject to capital adequacy requirements and may be subject to more stringent capital requirements.\nWe are subject to regulatory requirements relating to capital, which are subject to change from time to time. If we fail to meet applicable requirements, we may be restricted in the types of activities we may conduct, and we may be prohibited from taking certain capital actions, such as paying dividends and repurchasing capital securities. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation - Regulatory Capital Requirements\u201d for more information.\nWhile we have, and expect to continue to, meet the requirements of the Capital Rules, we may fail to do so. In addition, these requirements could have a negative impact on our ability to lend, grow deposit balances, make acquisitions or make capital distributions in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Higher capital levels could also lower our return on equity.\nWe may not pay dividends on our common stock in the future.\nHolders of our common stock are entitled to receive only such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely. In addition, we are a bank holding company, and our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve that bank holding companies should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of earnings, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization\u2019s expected future needs, asset quality and financial condition.\nFurther, if we are unable to satisfy the capital requirements applicable to us for any reason, we may not be able to make, or may have to reduce or eliminate, the payment of dividends on our common stock. Any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. See \u201cLiquidity Risks - Our liquidity is dependent on dividends from First Hawaiian Bank\u201d for additional information on our reliance on dividends paid to us by the Bank.\nRulemaking changes implemented by the CFPB have in the past resulted and may in the future result in higher regulatory and compliance costs that may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe CFPB is a federal agency responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB also has examination and primary enforcement authority with respect to depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets, their service providers and certain non-depository entities such as debt collectors and consumer reporting agencies. The consumer protection provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the examination, supervision and enforcement of those laws and implementing regulations by the CFPB have created a more intense and complex environment for consumer finance regulation. See \u201cItem 1. Business - Supervision and Regulation - Consumer Financial Protection.\u201d The ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain but could result in changes to pricing, practices, products and procedures. It could also result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination, additional remediation efforts and possible penalties. We may also be required to add additional compliance personnel or incur other significant compliance-related expenses. Our business, results of operations or competitive position may be adversely affected as a result.\nLitigation and regulatory actions, including possible enforcement actions, could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments or other requirements resulting in increased expenses or restrictions on our business activities.\nOur business is subject to increased litigation and regulatory risks as a result of a number of factors, including the highly regulated nature of the financial services industry and the focus of civil government attorneys on banks and the financial services industry generally, and in particular practices and requirements, including foreclosure practices, applicable consumer protection laws, classification of held for sale assets and compliance with anti-money laundering statutes, the Bank Secrecy Act and sanctions administered by OFAC. In addition, a single event or issue may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings, including by multiple federal and state regulators and other governmental authorities.\nIn the normal course of business, from time to time, we may be named as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our business activities. Certain of the legal actions have included, and may in the future include, claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In addition, while the arbitration provisions in certain of our customer agreements historically have limited our exposure to consumer class action litigation, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future. We may also, from time to time, be the subject of subpoenas, requests for information, reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business. Any such legal or regulatory actions may subject us to substantial compensatory or punitive damages, significant fines, penalties, obligations to change our business practices or other requirements resulting in increased expenses, diminished income and damage to our reputation. Our involvement in any such matters, even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor, could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Directives issued to enforce such actions may be confidential and thus, in some instances, we are not permitted to publicly disclose these actions. Further, any settlement, consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government agencies may result in litigation, investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government agencies begin independent reviews of the same activities. As a result, the outcome of legal and regulatory actions could be material to our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows depending on, among other factors, the level of our earnings for that period, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIncreases in FDIC insurance premiums may adversely affect our earnings.\nOur bank\u2019s deposits are insured by the FDIC up to legal limits and, accordingly, our bank is subject to FDIC deposit insurance assessments. We generally cannot control the amount of premiums our bank will be required to pay for FDIC insurance, and the FDIC may in the future increase assessment rates to meet the FDIC\u2019s designated reserve ratio, which is currently 2% of insured deposits. Future increases of FDIC insurance premiums or special assessments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions against us.\nThe USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the Bank Secrecy Act require financial institutions to design and implement programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Federal and state bank regulators also have focused heavily on compliance with Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations in recent years. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches, significant reputational harm and increased exposure to civil litigation. In recent years, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations, and, in some cases, governmental authorities have required as part of settlements criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms, including admissions of wrongdoing and the impositions of monitors. While we have developed policies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, these policies and procedures may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRegulations relating to privacy, information security and data protection could increase our costs, affect or limit how we collect and use personal information and adversely affect our business opportunities.\nWe are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, including requirements concerning security breach notification, and we could be negatively impacted by these laws. For example, our business is subject to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which, among other things: (i) imposes certain limitations on our ability to share nonpublic personal information about our customers with nonaffiliated third parties; (ii) requires that we provide certain disclosures to customers about our information collection, sharing and security practices and afford customers the right to \u201copt out\u201d of any information sharing by us with nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions) and (iii) requires that we develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards appropriate based on our size and complexity, the nature and scope of our activities, and the sensitivity of customer information we process, as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Various state and federal banking regulators and states have also proposed or enacted data security breach notification requirements with varying levels of individual, consumer, regulatory or law enforcement notification in certain circumstances in the event of a security breach. Moreover, legislators and regulators in the United States are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws that potentially could have a significant impact on our current and planned privacy, data protection and information security-related practices, our collection, use, sharing, retention and safeguarding of consumer or employee information, and some of our current or planned business activities. As new privacy-related laws and regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and any future laws and regulations which will be modeled after those laws, are implemented, the time and resources needed for us to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as our potential liability for non-compliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches, may significantly increase. This could result from, among other things, increased privacy-related enforcement activity at the federal level, by the Federal Trade Commission, as well as at the state level, such as with regard to mobile applications.\nCompliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws (including those regarding security breach notification) to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws could result in potentially significant regulatory or governmental investigations or actions, litigation, fines, sanctions and damage to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDifferences in regulation can affect our ability to compete effectively.\nThe content and application of laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions vary according to the size of the institution, the jurisdictions in which the institution is organized and operates and other factors. We may be subject to more stringent regulatory requirements and supervision than smaller institutions or institutions that operate in other jurisdictions. In addition, financial technology companies and other non-bank competitors may not be subject to banking regulation, or may be regulated by a national or state agency that does not have the same regulatory priorities or supervisory requirements as our regulators. These differences in regulation can impair our ability to compete effectively with competitors that are less regulated and that do not have similar compliance costs.\nOur use of third-party vendors and our other ongoing third-party business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention.\nWe regularly use third-party vendors as part of our business. We also have substantial ongoing business relationships with other third parties. These types of third-party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by our federal bank regulators, as well as heightened supervisory expectations regarding our due diligence, ongoing monitoring and control over our third-party vendors and other ongoing third-party business relationships. In certain cases, we may be required to renegotiate our agreements with these vendors to meet these enhanced requirements, which could increase our costs. We expect that our regulators will hold us responsible for deficiencies in our oversight and control of our third-party relationships and in the performance of the parties with which we have these relationships. As a result, if our regulators conclude that we have not exercised adequate oversight and control over our third-party vendors or other ongoing third-party business relationships or that such third parties have not performed appropriately, we could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil money penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our bank branches and any real estate collateral we acquire upon foreclosure.\nDuring the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans that we have originated or acquired. We also have an extensive branch network, owning separate branch locations throughout the areas we serve. For any real property that we may possess, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage and costs of complying with applicable environmental regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with such requirements can result in penalties. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property\u2019s value or limit our ability to use, sell or lease the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be subject to litigation risk pertaining to our fiduciary responsibilities.\nSome of the services we provide, such as trust and investment services, require us to act as fiduciaries for our customers and others. From time to time, third parties make claims and take legal action against us pertaining to the performance of our fiduciary responsibilities. If these claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us, we may be exposed to significant financial liability or our reputation could be damaged. Either of these results may adversely impact demand for our products and services or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOther Risks Affecting Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, us and our customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers, and the adverse impacts on our business, financial position, results of operations, and prospects could be significant and are difficult to predict\nThe spread of COVID-19 has created a global public health crisis that has resulted in widespread volatility, uncertainty and deteriorations in business, economic, and market conditions and has adversely affected our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively impact our capital, liquidity, and other financial positions and on our business, results of operations, and prospects will depend on a number of evolving factors, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted and many of which are outside of our control, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, whether any new COVID variants or other diseases emerge, the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our employees, customers, clients, counterparties and service providers, as well as other market participants, and actions taken, or that may yet be taken, or inaction, by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to, among other things:\n\u2022 Increased unemployment and supply chain and business disruption and decreased consumer and business confidence and consumer and commercial activity generally, leading to an increased risk of delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures;\n\u2022 Credit deterioration and defaults in many industries, particularly travel and leisure, restaurants, entertainment and commercial real estate;\n\u2022 A decline in collateral values;\n\u2022 A sudden and significant reduction in the valuation of the equity, fixed-income and commodity markets and the significant increase in the volatility of those markets;\n\u2022 A decrease in the rates and yields on U.S. Treasury securities, which may lead to decreased net interest income;\n\u2022 Higher and more volatile credit loss expense and potential for increased charge-offs, particularly as customers may need to draw on their committed credit lines to help finance their businesses and activities;\n\u2022 Heightened cybersecurity, information security and operational risks as a result of a remote workforce and impacts on our service providers;\n\u2022 Operational failures due to changes in our normal business practices necessitated by the outbreak and related governmental actions; and\n\u2022 An increasingly competitive labor market due to an ongoing labor shortage which has impacted and could continue to impact our ability to staff open positions and/or retain existing employees and has resulted in and could continue to result in an increase in our staffing costs.\nThese factors may remain prevalent for a significant period of time and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided.\nAs noted in the section captioned \u201cRecent Developments regarding COVID-19 and the Hawaii and Global Economy\u201d in Part II. Financial Information, Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations elsewhere in this report, the Federal Reserve has taken various actions and the U.S. government has enacted several fiscal stimulus measures to counteract the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses, stabilize the markets and support economic growth. The ultimate success of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to fully mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We face an increased risk of litigation and governmental, regulatory and third-party scrutiny as a result of the effects of COVID-19 on market and economic conditions and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions.\nWe are unable to estimate the ongoing impact of COVID-19 on our business and operations at this time. Should it continue for an extended period or increase in severity, the pandemic could cause us to experience higher credit losses in our lending portfolio, impairment of our goodwill (or additional assessments of the same) and other financial assets, further reduced demand for our products and services, and other negative impacts on our financial position, results of operations, and prospects. Sustained adverse effects may also prevent us from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory requirements or result in downgrades in our credit ratings. Even after the pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy may be challenged, and we anticipate our businesses would be materially and adversely affected by any prolonged recession.\nSevere weather, hurricanes, tsunamis, natural disasters, pandemics, acts of war or terrorism or other external events could significantly impact our business.\nSevere weather, hurricanes, tsunamis, natural disasters, widespread disease or pandemics or other severe health emergencies, or concerns over the possibility of such an emergency (including the COVID-19 pandemic), acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our business. Additionally, financial markets may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including escalating military tension between Russia and Ukraine, terrorism or other geopolitical events. Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. Furthermore, the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Because Hawaii\u2019s economy is heavily dependent on the tourism industry, which is in turn heavily influenced by the affordability and desirability of air travel, any related safety concerns or limitations and the prevailing weather patterns in the region, we could be disproportionately affected relative to others in the case of external events such as acts of war or terrorism, severe weather, natural disasters or pandemics or other actual or perceived severe health emergencies, including travel restrictions as a result of actual or perceived health emergencies that impact markets on which we depend. The occurrence of any of these events in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe own the building in Honolulu in which our principal office and headquarters are located. Given that we derive a portion of our income from leasing space in our principal office building and that the largest concentration of our employees is located in our principal office building, depending on the intensity and longevity of the event, a catastrophic event impacting our Honolulu office building, including a terrorist attack, extreme weather event or other hostile or catastrophic event, could negatively affect our business and reputation and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nClimate change could have a material negative impact on us and our customers.\nOur business, as well as the operations and activities of our customers, could be negatively impacted by climate change. Climate change presents both immediate and long-term risks to us and our customers and these risks are expected to increase over time. Climate changes presents multi-faceted risks, including (i) operational risk from the physical effects of climate events on our facilities and other assets as well as those of our customers; (ii) credit risk from borrowers with significant exposure to climate risk; and (iii) reputational risk from stakeholder concerns about our practices related to climate change, our carbon footprint and our business relationships with customers who operate in carbon-intensive industries.\nFor instance, climate change exposes us and our customers to physical risk as its effects may lead to more frequent and more extreme weather events, such as prolonged droughts or flooding, tornados, hurricanes, wildfires and extreme seasonal weather; and longer-term shifts, such as increasing average temperatures, ozone depletion and rising sea levels. As our primary markets are located on islands in the Pacific Ocean, they may be particularly susceptible to certain of these risks or other risks resulting from climate change, including those relating to rising sea levels. Such events and long-term shifts may also have a significant impact on our customers, which could amplify credit risk by diminishing borrowers\u2019 repayment capacity or collateral values, and other businesses and counterparties with whom we transact, which could have a broader impact on the economy, supply chains and distribution networks.\nClimate change may also result in new and/or more stringent regulatory requirements for the Company, which could materially affect the Company\u2019s results of operations by requiring the Company to take costly measures to comply with any new laws or regulations related to climate change that may be forthcoming. New regulations or guidance, or the attitudes of regulators, shareholders and employees regarding climate change, may affect the activities in which the Company engages and the products that the Company offers. In addition, an increasing perspective that financial institutions, including the Company, play an important role in managing risks related to climate change, including indirectly with respect to their customers, may result in increased pressure on the Company to take additional steps to disclose and manage its climate risks and related lending and other activities. Risks associated with climate change are continuing to evolve rapidly, making it difficult to assess the effects of climate change on the Company, and the Company expects that climate change-related risks will continue to evolve and increase over time.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile, and you could lose part or all of your investment as a result.\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive. Our stock price may fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including, among other things:\n\u25cf Actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\u25cf Recommendations or research reports about us or the financial services industry in general published by securities analysts;\n\u25cf The failure of securities analysts to cover, or continue to cover, us;\n\u25cf Operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u25cf News reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry;\n\u25cf Future sales of our common stock;\n\u25cf Departure of our management team or other key personnel;\n\u25cf New technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u25cf Significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;\n\u25cf Changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations, or differing interpretations thereof affecting our business, or enforcement of these laws and regulations;\n\u25cf Litigation and governmental investigations; and\n\u25cf Geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts.\nIf any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to litigation that, even if our defense is successful, could distract our management and be costly to defend. General market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events - such as economic slowdowns or recessions, interest rate changes or credit loss trends - could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.\nFuture sales and issuances of our common stock, including sales as part of our equity-based compensation plans, could result in dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could lower our stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock or from the perception that such sales could occur. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling equity securities in the future, at a time and price that we deem appropriate. As of February 10, 2022, we had a total of 128,157,353 shares of common stock outstanding.\nWe have filed a registration statement to register 6,253,385 shares of our common stock for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the equity incentive and employee stock purchase plans. In April 2021, our stockholders approved an amendment and restatement of the First Hawaiian, Inc. 2016 Non-Employee Director Plan principally to increase the total number of shares of common stock that may be awarded under that plan by 193,941 shares. We have granted awards covering 2,399,805 shares of our common stock under these plans as of December 31, 2021. We may increase the number of shares registered for this purpose from time to time, subject to stockholder approval. Once we register and issue these shares, their holders will be able to sell them in the public market, subject to applicable transfer restrictions.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances or sales of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances or sales of shares of our common stock may have on the market price of our common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nCertain banking laws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have an anti-takeover effect.\nProvisions of federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our stockholders. Acquisition of 10% or more of any class of voting stock of a bank holding company or depository institution, including shares of our common stock, generally creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquirer \u201ccontrols\u201d the bank holding company or depository institution. Also, a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before, among other things, acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any bank, including our bank.\nThere also are provisions in our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which we refer to as our certificate of incorporation, and fourth amended and restated bylaws, which we refer to as our bylaws, such as limitations on the ability to call a special meeting of our stockholders and restrictions on stockholders\u2019 ability to act by written consent, that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt. In addition, our board of directors is authorized under our certificate of incorporation to issue shares of our preferred stock, and determine the rights, terms conditions and privileges of such preferred stock, without stockholder approval. These provisions may effectively inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to BNPP\u2019s Divestiture of Our Common Stock\nWe may be subject to unexpected income tax liabilities in connection with the Reorganization Transactions. BWHI is required to pay us for any unexpected income tax liabilities that arise in connection with the Reorganization Transactions. However, in the event that BWHI does not satisfy its payment obligations, we could be subject to significantly higher federal and/or state and local income tax liabilities than currently anticipated.\nBNPP, BWHI and we expect that no U.S. federal income taxes will be imposed on us in connection with the Reorganization Transactions. However, we paid state and local income taxes of approximately $95.4 million in June 2016 (which was partially offset by a federal tax reduction of approximately $33.4 million received through the intercompany settlement of estimated taxes in April 2017) in connection with the Reorganization Transactions (the \u201cExpected Taxes\u201d). BNPP, BWHI and we reported a total tax liability in connection with the Reorganization Transactions of $92.1 million (the \u201cReturn Taxes\u201d) in the tax returns of various state and local jurisdictions. Pursuant to the Tax Sharing Agreement, we reimbursed BWHI approximately $2.1 million due to the Return Taxes being lower than the Expected Taxes. Such amount was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital. We could be subject to higher income tax liabilities in the event that the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) or state and local tax authorities successfully assert that our income tax liabilities in respect of the Reorganization Transactions are higher than the Return Taxes. Under the terms of the Tax Sharing Agreement, BWHI is required to pay us for any such additional taxes on an \u201cafter-tax basis\u201d (which means an amount determined by reducing the payment amount by any tax benefits derived by the Company and increasing the payment amount by any tax costs, including additional taxes, incurred by the Company as a result of such additional taxes and/or payments). See \u201cCertain Related Party Transactions\u201d in the Company\u2019s Proxy Statement is incorporated herein by reference. If, however, our income tax liabilities with respect to the Reorganization Transactions are higher than the Return Taxes and BWHI fails to satisfy its payment obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement, we could be liable for significantly higher federal and/or state income tax liabilities. We have not sought and will not seek any rulings from the IRS or state and local tax authorities regarding our expected tax treatment of the Reorganization Transactions.\nIn addition, under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) and related rules and regulations, each entity that was a member of the BancWest combined tax reporting group during any taxable period or portion of any taxable period ending on or before the effective time of the Reorganization Transactions is jointly and severally liable for the U.S. federal income tax liability of the entire combined tax reporting group for such taxable period. Although the Tax Sharing Agreement allocates the responsibility for prior period taxes of the combined tax reporting group in accordance with the existing tax allocation agreements, if BWHI were unable to pay any such prior period taxes for which it is responsible, we could be required to pay the entire amount of such taxes, and such amounts could be significant. Other provisions of federal, state or local tax law may establish similar liability for other matters, including laws governing tax qualified pension plans, as well as other contingent liabilities.", "PERMNO": 16253, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FHB"}
