These risks are not the only risks facing Essendant; the Company\u2019s business operations could also be materially adversely affected by risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to Essendant or that Essendant currently deems immaterial.\nThe loss of one or more significant customers could significantly reduce Essendant\u2019s revenues and profitability.\nIn 2015, Essendant\u2019s largest customer accounted for approximately 12% of net sales and Essendant\u2019s top five customers accounted for approximately 28.9% of net sales. Several of Essendant\u2019s current and potential customers were involved in business combinations in 2015 and the Company expects increased customer consolidation in the future. In February 2015, two of Essendant\u2019s five largest customers announced they intend to merge. Following business combinations, the surviving companies often review their supply chain and sourcing options, which can result in the companies altering their sourcing relationships. Increasing direct purchases by major customers from manufacturers, as well as the loss of one or more key customers, changes in the sales mix or sales volume to key customers, or a significant downturn in the business or financial condition of any of them could significantly reduce Essendant\u2019s sales and profitability.\nDemand for office products may continue to decline.\nThe overall demand for certain office products may continue to weaken as consumers increasingly create, share, and store documents electronically, without printing or filing them. If demand continues to decline and Essendant is unable to offset lower aggregate demand by increasing market share for these products, finding new markets for these products, increasing sales of products in other categories, and reducing expenses, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nEssendant relies on independent resellers for a significant percentage of its net sales.\nSales to independent resellers account for a significant portion of Essendant\u2019s net sales. Independent resellers compete with national distributors and retailers that have substantially greater financial resources and technical and marketing capabilities. Financial, technical, and commercial constraints are increasingly challenging as business increasingly shifts online. Over the years, several of the Company\u2019s independent reseller customers have been acquired by competitors or have ceased operation. If Essendant\u2019s customer base of independent resellers declines, the Company\u2019s business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nEssendant\u2019s Industrial business may experience financial cycles related to economic factors that are different than the office products market segment.\nSales of Essendant\u2019s industrial and automotive products are affected by oil prices, oil rig count, and broader industrial market pressures, that are subject to cyclical fluctuations and that in some cases differ from the factors impacting sales in other Essendant product categories. As the Company\u2019s presence grows in the industrial marketplace, these impacts and cycles may become more apparent. Thus, a significant or prolonged slowdown in the energy, automotive or industrial sectors could negatively impact Essendant\u2019s sales growth and results of operations.\nEssendant\u2019s operating results depend on the strength of the market segments the Company serves.\nThe customers that Essendant serves are affected by changes in economic conditions outside the Company\u2019s control, including national, regional, and local slowdowns in general economic activity, job markets, and market segments the Company serves. Demand for the products and services the Company offers, particularly in the office product, technology, and furniture categories, is affected by the number of white collar and other workers employed by the businesses Essendant\u2019s customers serve. If employment rates decline, do not grow, or continue to grow at a slow rate, demand for the products the Company sells could be adversely affected.\nThe Company relies heavily on the ability to recruit, retain, and develop high-performing managers and the lack of execution in these areas could harm the Company\u2019s ability to carry out its business strategy.\nEssendant\u2019s ability to implement its business strategy depends largely on the efforts, skills, abilities, and judgment of the Company\u2019s executive management team. Essendant\u2019s success also depends to a significant degree on its ability to recruit and retain sales and marketing, operations, and other senior managers. The Company may not be successful in attracting and retaining these employees, which may in turn have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nA significant disruption or failure of the Company\u2019s information technology systems could disrupt Essendant\u2019s business, result in increased costs and decreased revenues, harm the Company\u2019s reputation, and expose the Company to liability.\nThe Company relies on information technology in all aspects of its business, including managing and replenishing inventory, filling and shipping customer orders, and coordinating sales and marketing activities. Several of the Company\u2019s software applications are legacy systems which the Company must periodically update, enhance, and replace. A significant disruption or failure of the Company\u2019s existing information technology systems or in the Company\u2019s development and implementation of new systems could put it at a competitive disadvantage and could adversely affect its results of operations.\nPrice transparency, customer consolidation, and changes in product sales mix may result in lower margins.\nThe Company faces price and margin pressure due to a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nIncreased price transparency, driven by online resellers;\n\u00b7\nCustomer consolidation resulting in some customers increasing their buying power and seeking economic concessions from the Company;\n\u00b7\nGrowth in lower margin channels and vertical markets;\n\u00b7\nSecular decline in office products categories leading to unfavorable product mix; and\n\u00b7\nVendor consolidation.\nIf Essendant is unable to reduce expenses, grow sales to existing and new customers, and increase sales of higher margin products as a percentage of total sales, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nA breach of the Company\u2019s information technology systems could result in costly enforcement actions and litigation and could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and relationships.\nThrough Essendant\u2019s sales, marketing, and e-commerce activities, the Company collects and stores personally identifiable information and credit card data that customers provide when they buy products or services, enroll in promotional programs, or otherwise communicate with Essendant. Essendant also gathers and retains information about its employees in the normal course of business. Essendant uses vendors to assist with certain aspects of Essendant\u2019s business and, to enable the vendors to perform services for Essendant, the Company shares some of the information provided by customers and employees. Similarly, to enable Essendant to provide goods and services to its customers, Essendant\u2019s customers share with Essendant information their customers provide to them. Essendant has, from time to time, experienced attempts to breach its systems, and these attempts are expected to continue. Any loss, unauthorized access to or misuse of our information technology systems could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations, expose Essendant to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, and other persons, and damage the Company\u2019s reputation. In addition, compliance with more stringent privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes.\nCombining Essendant\u2019s businesses on a common platform may result in disruptions with suppliers and customers.\nEssendant is in the process of combining its businesses onto a common platform with common systems and processes. These activities could disrupt Essendant\u2019s relationships with customers and suppliers or could impair the Company\u2019s ability to timely and accurately record transactions, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nEssendant\u2019s reliance on supplier allowances and promotional incentives could impact profitability.\nSupplier allowances and promotional incentives that are often based on volume contribute significantly to Essendant\u2019s profitability. If Essendant does not comply with suppliers\u2019 terms and conditions, or does not make requisite purchases to achieve certain volume hurdles, Essendant may not earn certain allowances and promotional incentives. Additionally, suppliers may reduce the allowances they pay Essendant if they conclude the value Essendant creates does not justify the allowances. If Essendant\u2019s suppliers reduce or otherwise alter their allowances or promotional incentives, Essendant\u2019s profit margin for the sale of the products it purchases from those suppliers may decline. The loss or diminution of supplier allowances and promotional support could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nEssendant is exposed to the credit risk of its customers.\nEssendant extends credit to its customers. The failure of a significant customer or a significant group of customers to timely pay all amounts due Essendant could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. The Company\u2019s trade receivables are generally unsecured or subordinated to other lenders, and many of the Company\u2019s customers are highly leveraged. The extension of credit involves considerable judgment and is based on management\u2019s evaluation of a variety of factors, including customers\u2019 financial condition and payment history, the availability of collateral to secure customers\u2019 receivables, and customers\u2019 prospects for maintaining or increasing their sales revenues. There can be no assurance that Essendant has assessed and will continue to assess the creditworthiness of its existing or future customers accurately.\nEssendant operates in a competitive environment.\nThe Company operates in a competitive environment. The Company competes with other wholesale distributors and with the manufacturers of the products the Company sells. In addition, the Company competes with warehouse clubs and the business-to-business sales divisions of national business products resellers. Competition is based largely upon service capabilities and price, as the Company\u2019s competitors generally offer products that are the same as or similar to the products the Company offers to the same customers or potential customers. These competitive pressures are exacerbated by the ongoing decline in the overall demand for office products. The competitive arena is also increasingly shifting online. The Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations depend on its ability to compete effectively on price, product selection and availability, marketing support, logistics, and other ancillary services; diversify its product offering; and provide services and capabilities that enable its customers to succeed online.\nSupply chain disruptions or changes in key suppliers\u2019 distribution strategies could decrease Essendant\u2019s revenues and profitability.\nEssendant believes its ability to offer a combination of well-known brand name products, competitively priced private brand products, and support services is an important factor in attracting and retaining customers. The Company\u2019s ability to offer a wide range of products and services is dependent on obtaining adequate product supply and services from manufacturers or other suppliers. Essendant\u2019s agreements with its suppliers are generally terminable by either party on limited notice. The loss of, or a substantial decrease in the availability of products or services from key suppliers at competitive prices could cause the Company\u2019s revenues and profitability to decrease. In addition, supply interruptions could arise due to transportation disruptions, labor disputes or other factors beyond Essendant\u2019s control. Disruptions in Essendant\u2019s supply chain could result in a decrease in revenues and profitability.\nSome manufacturers refuse to sell their products to wholesalers like Essendant. Other manufacturers only allow Essendant to sell their products to specified customers. If changes in key suppliers\u2019 distribution strategies or practices reduce the breadth of products the Company is able to purchase or the number of customers to whom Essendant can sell key products, the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nMany of the Company\u2019s independent resellers use third party technology vendors (\u201c3PVs\u201d) to automate their business operations. The 3PVs play an important role in the independent dealer channel, as most purchase orders, order confirmations, stock availability checks, invoices, and advanced shipping notices are exchanged between Essendant and its independent resellers over 3PV networks. The 3PVs also provide e-commerce portals that Essendant\u2019s customers use to transact online business with their customers. If Essendant is unable to transact business with its customers through one or more 3PVs on terms that are acceptable to Essendant, or if a 3PV fails to provide quality services to Essendant\u2019s customers, Essendant\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nEssendant must manage inventory effectively while minimizing excess and obsolete inventory.\nTo maximize supplier allowances and minimize excess and obsolete inventory, Essendant must project end-consumer demand for over 180,000 items in stock. If Essendant underestimates demand for a particular manufacturer\u2019s products, the Company will lose sales, reduce customer satisfaction, and earn a lower level of allowances from that manufacturer. If Essendant overestimates demand, it may have to liquidate excess or obsolete inventory at a price that would produce a lower margin, no margin, or a loss.\nEssendant is focusing on increasing its sales of private brand products. These products can present unique inventory challenges. Essendant sources some of its private brand products overseas, resulting in longer order-lead times than for comparable products sourced domestically. These longer lead-times make it more difficult to forecast demand accurately and require larger inventory investments to support high service levels.\nEssendant may not be successful in identifying, consummating, and integrating future acquisitions.\nHistorically, part of Essendant\u2019s growth and expansion into new product categories or markets has come from targeted acquisitions. Essendant may not be able to identify attractive acquisition candidates or complete the acquisition of any identified candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms. Furthermore, competition for attractive acquisition candidates may limit the number of acquisition candidates or increase the overall costs of making acquisitions. Acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including difficulties integrating acquired business systems and personnel with Essendant\u2019s business; the potential loss of key employees, customers or suppliers; the assumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies; the difficulties in achieving target synergies; and the diversion of management attention and resources from existing operations. Difficulties in identifying, completing or integrating acquisitions could impede Essendant\u2019s revenues, profitability, and net worth. In addition, some of the Company\u2019s acquisitions have included foreign operations, and future acquisitions may increase Essendant\u2019s international presence. International operations present a variety of unique risks, including the costs and difficulties of managing foreign enterprises, limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds, currency fluctuations, cultural differences that affect customer preferences and business practices, and unstable political or economic conditions.\nThe Company is subject to costs and risks associated with laws, regulations, and industry standards affecting Essendant\u2019s business.\nEssendant is subject to a wide range of state, federal, and foreign laws and industry standards, including laws and standards regarding labor and employment, government contracting, product liability, the storage and transportation of hazardous materials, privacy and data security, imports and exports, tax, and intellectual property, as well as laws relating to the Company\u2019s international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and foreign tax laws. These laws, regulations, and standards may change, sometimes significantly, as a result of political or economic events. The complex legal and regulatory environment exposes Essendant to compliance and litigation costs and risks that could materially affect Essendant\u2019s operations and financial results. See \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d included below under Item 3.\nEssendant\u2019s financial condition and results of operations depend on the availability of financing sources to meet its business needs.\nThe Company depends on various external financing sources to fund its operating, investing, and financing activities. The Company\u2019s financing agreements include covenants by the Company to maintain certain financial ratios and comply with other obligations. If the Company violates a covenant or otherwise defaults on its obligations under a financing agreement, the Company\u2019s lenders may refuse to extend additional credit, demand repayment of outstanding indebtedness, and terminate the financing agreements. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d included below under Item 7.\nThe Company\u2019s primary external financing sources terminate or mature in 2017 and 2021 years. If the Company defaults on its obligations under a financing agreement or is unable to obtain or renew financing sources on commercially reasonable terms, its business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nUnexpected events could disrupt normal business operations, which might result in increased costs and decreased revenues.\nUnexpected events, such as hurricanes, fire, war, terrorism, and other natural or man-made disruptions, may adversely impact Essendant\u2019s ability to serve its customers and increase the cost of doing business or otherwise impact Essendant\u2019s financial performance. In addition, damage to or loss of use of significant aspects of the Company\u2019s infrastructure due to such events could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 79303, "SIC": 5045, "TIC": "ESND"}
