{"cik": "357173", "company": "OLD SECOND BANCORP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nThe material risks that management believes affect the Company are described below. Before making an investment decision with respect to any of the Company\u2019s securities, you should carefully consider the risks as described below, together with all of the information included herein. The risks described below are not the only risks the Company faces. Additional risks not presently known also may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. The risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ substantially from those discussed or implied in these forward-looking statements.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nRisks Relating to the Company\u2019s Business\nA return of recessionary conditions could result in increases in the Company\u2019s level of nonperforming loans and/or reduced demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, which could lead to lower revenue, higher loan losses and lower earnings.\nA return of recessionary conditions and/or negative developments in the domestic and international credit markets may significantly affect the markets in which the Company does business, the value of its loans and investments and its ongoing operations, costs and profitability. Despite a general improvement in the overall economy and the real estate market, the economic environment remains challenging, particularly in the Company\u2019s market area. Declines in real estate values and sales volumes and increased unemployment or underemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan delinquencies, increases in the Company\u2019s levels of nonperforming and classified assets and a decline in demand for its products and services. These negative events may cause the Company to incur losses and may adversely affect its capital, liquidity and financial condition.\nThe size of the Company\u2019s loan portfolio has grown in recent years, but, if the Company is unable to sustain loan growth, its profitability may be adversely affected.\nSince December 31, 2011, the Company\u2019s gross loans held for investment have increased from $1.37 billion to $1.48 billion at December 31, 2016. During some years in this period, the Company was managing its balance sheet composition to manage its capital levels and position the Bank to meet and exceed its targeted capital levels. The Company\u2019s ability to increase profitability will depend on a variety of factors, including its ability to originate attractive new lending relationships. While the Company believes it has the management resources and lending staff in place to continue the successful implementation of its strategic plan, if the Company is unable to increase the size of its loan portfolio, its strategic plan may not be successful and its profitability may be adversely affected.\nNonperforming assets take significant time to resolve, adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition and could result in further losses in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s nonperforming loans (which consist of nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more, still accruing interest and restructured loans still accruing interest) and its nonperforming assets (which include nonperforming loans plus OREO) are reflected in the table below at December 31 (in millions):\n% Change\nNonperforming loans\n$\n16.0 \t\t\t\t\n$\n14.6 \t\t\t\t\n9.6 \t\t\t\t\nOREO\n11.9 \t\t\t\t\n19.1 \t\t\t\t\n(37.7) \t\t\t\t\nTotal nonperforming assets\n$\n27.9 \t\t\t\t\n$\n33.7 \t\t\t\t\n(17.2) \t\t\t\t\nThe Company\u2019s nonperforming assets adversely affect its net income in various ways. For example, the Company does not accrue interest income on nonaccrual loans and OREO may have expenses in excess of any lease revenues collected, thereby adversely affecting the Company\u2019s net income, return on assets and return on equity. The Company\u2019s loan administration costs also increase because of its nonperforming assets. The resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant time commitments from management, which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities. There is no assurance that the Company will not experience increases in nonperforming assets in the future, or that its nonperforming assets will not result in losses in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s loan portfolio is concentrated heavily in commercial and residential real estate loans, including exposure to construction loans, which involve risks specific to real estate values and the real estate markets in general, all of which have experienced significant weakness.\nThe Company\u2019s loan portfolio generally reflects the profile of the communities in which the Company operates. Because the Company operates in areas that saw rapid historical growth, real estate lending of all types is a significant portion of its loan portfolio. Total real estate lending, excluding deferred fees, remains at $1.18 billion, or approximately 79.7% of the Company\u2019s December 31, 2016 loan portfolio compared to $976.5 million or approximately 86.1% at December 31, 2015. Given that the primary (if not only) source of collateral on these loans is real estate, additional adverse developments affecting real estate values in the Company\u2019s market area could increase the credit risk associated with the Company\u2019s real estate loan portfolio.\nThe effects of ongoing real estate challenges, combined with the ongoing correction in commercial and residential real estate market prices and reduced levels of home sales, have adversely affected the Company\u2019s real estate loan portfolio and have the potential to further adversely affect such portfolio in several ways, each of which could further adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nReal estate market volatility and future changes in disposition strategies could result in net proceeds that differ significantly from fair value appraisals of loan collateral and OREO and could negatively impact the Company\u2019s operating performance.\nMany of the Company\u2019s nonperforming real estate loans are collateral-dependent, meaning the repayment of the loan is largely dependent upon the cash flows from the operation of the property securing the loan, or the sale of the property. For collateral-dependent loans, the Company estimates the value of the loan based on appraised value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Company\u2019s OREO portfolio essentially consists of properties acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure in partial or total satisfaction of certain loans as a result of borrower defaults. Some property in OREO reflects property formerly utilized as a bank premise or land that was acquired with the expectation that a bank premise would be established at the location. In some cases, the market for such properties has been significantly depressed, and we have been unable to sell them at prices or within timeframes that we deem acceptable\nOREO is recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loans for which property served as collateral or estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs. In determining the value of OREO properties and loan collateral, an orderly disposition of the property is generally assumed. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of property, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility.\nThe Company\u2019s allowance for loan losses may be insufficient to absorb potential losses in the Company\u2019s loan portfolio.\nThe Company maintains an allowance for loan losses at a level the Company believes adequate to absorb estimated losses inherent in its existing loan portfolio. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations; specific credit risks; credit loss experience; current loan portfolio quality; present economic, political, and regulatory conditions; and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio.\nWhile the Company had loan loss reserve releases in 2013, 2014 and 2015, its provision for loan losses was increased in 2016, and the Bank may be required to make significant increases in the provision for loan losses and to charge-off additional loans in the future.\nDetermination of the allowance is inherently subjective since it requires significant estimates and management judgment of credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo material changes. For example, the final allowance for December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, included an amount reserved for other not specifically identified risk factors. New information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, and other factors, both within and outside of the Company\u2019s control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the Company\u2019s allowance and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of management. Finally, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, the Company will need additional provisions to increase the allowance. Any increases in the allowance will result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business is concentrated in and dependent upon the welfare of several counties in Illinois specifically and the State of Illinois generally.\nThe Company\u2019s primary market area is Aurora, Illinois, and its surrounding communities as well as Cook County. The city of Aurora is located in northeastern Illinois, approximately 40 miles west of Chicago. The Bank operates primarily in Kane, Kendall, DeKalb, DuPage, LaSalle, Will and Cook counties in Illinois, and, as a result, the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to changes and fluctuations in the economic conditions in those areas.\nThe communities that the Company serves grew rapidly during the early 21st century, and despite the relative severity of the economic downturn that hit the Company\u2019s key markets, the Company intends to continue concentrating its business efforts in these communities. The Company\u2019s future success is largely dependent upon the overall economic health of these communities and the ability of the communities to continue to rebound from the difficulties that began in 2007. While the economies in our market have stabilized, difficult economic conditions remain, and the State of Illinois continues to experience severe fiscal challenges and its elected representatives remain unable to reach an agreement on a state budget. Payment lapses by the State of Illinois to its vendors and government sponsored entities may have negative effects on our primary market area. To the extent that these issues, or any future state tax increases, impact the economic vitality of the businesses operating in Illinois, encourage businesses to leave the state or discourage new employers to start or move businesses to Illinois, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the overall economic conditions do not continue to improve, particularly within the Company\u2019s primary market areas, the Company could experience a lack of demand for its products and services, an increase in loan delinquencies and defaults and high or increased levels of problem assets and foreclosures with little prospect of state governmental issue resolution or assistance, even contractual assistance. Moreover, because of the Company\u2019s geographic concentration, it is less able than other regional or national financial institutions to diversify its credit risks across multiple markets.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCredit downgrades, partial charge-offs and specific reserves could develop in selected exposures with resulting impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition if the State of Illinois encounters more severe financial difficulties. Management continues to closely monitor the impact of developments on our markets and customers.\nThe Company operates in a highly competitive industry and market area and may face severe competitive disadvantages.\nThe Company faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and have more financial resources. The Company\u2019s competitors primarily include national and regional banks as well as community banks within the markets the Company serves. Recently, local competitors have expanded their presence in the western suburbs of Chicago, including the communities that surround Aurora, Illinois, and these competitors may be better positioned than the Company to compete for loans, acquisitions and personnel. The Company also faces competition from savings and loan associations, credit unions, personal loan and finance companies, retail and discount stockbrokers, investment advisors, mutual funds, insurance companies, and other financial intermediaries. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative and regulatory changes, and many large scale competitors can leverage economies of scale to offer better pricing for products and services compared to what the Company can offer.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends on developing and maintaining long-term customer relationships, offering community banking services with features and pricing in line with customer interests and expectations, consistently achieving outstanding levels of customer service and adapting to many and frequent changes in banking as well as local or regional economies. Failure to excel in these areas could significantly weaken the Company\u2019s competitive position, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s growth and profitability. These weaknesses could have a significant negative impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nPotential future acquisitions could be difficult to integrate, disruptive to the Company\u2019s business, dilutive to our stockholder value or adverse to our financial results.\nAs part of its business strategy, the Company may consider acquisitions of other banks or financial institutions or branches, assets or deposits of such organizations from time to time. There is no assurance, however, that the Company will determine to pursue any of these opportunities or that, if the Company does pursue such an opportunity, that the Company will be successful in consummating an acquisition. Moreover, acquisitions generally involve numerous risks, including: difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products, existing contracts, accounting processes and personnel of the target entity and realizing the anticipated synergies of the combined businesses; difficulties in supporting and transitioning customers of the target company; diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations; the price the Company pays or other resources that it devotes to the transaction may exceed the value that it ultimately realizes, or the value the Company could have realized if it had allocated the purchase price or other resources to another opportunity; risks of entering new markets or areas in which the Company has limited or no experience or are outside its core competencies; potential loss of key employees, customers and strategic alliances from either the Company\u2019s current business or the business of the target company; assumption of unanticipated problems or latent liabilities; and an inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs.\nIf a future acquisition involves the issuance of equity securities as payment or in connection with financing, the ownership interests of existing stockholders could be diluted. The failure to successfully evaluate and execute an acquisition, the failure to adequately assess the risks associated with an acquisition, and the incurrence of additional debt and related interest expenses in connection with an acquisition, as well as any unforeseen liabilities, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Bank is a community bank and its ability to maintain its reputation is critical to the success of its business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect its performance.\nThe Bank is a community bank, and its reputation is one of the most valuable components of its business. As such, the Company strives to conduct its business in a manner that enhances its reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share the Company\u2019s core values: being an integral part of the communities the Company serves; delivering superior service to the Company\u2019s customers; and caring about the Company\u2019s customers and associates. If the Company\u2019s reputation is negatively affected, by the actions of its employees or otherwise, its business and operating results may be adversely affected.\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk, and a change in interest rates could have a negative effect on its net income.\nThe Company\u2019s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon the Company\u2019s net interest income. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company\u2019s control, including general economic conditions, the Company\u2019s competition and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy could influence Company earnings. Such changes could also affect the Company\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits as well as the average duration of the Company\u2019s securities portfolio. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, the Company\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings,\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncould be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings.\nAlthough management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the Company\u2019s results of operations, any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the Company fails to maintain sufficient capital, whether due to losses, an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise, its financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as its ability to maintain regulatory compliance, would be adversely affected.\nThe Company and the Bank must meet minimum regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity. Bank capital is impacted by dividends paid by the Bank to the Company. The Company also faces significant capital and other regulatory requirements as a financial institution. The Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, when and if needed, will depend on conditions in the economy and capital markets, and a number of other factors - including investor perceptions regarding the Company, banking industry and market condition, and governmental activities - many of which are outside the Company\u2019s control, and on the Company\u2019s financial condition and performance. If the Company fails to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements, its financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Company could experience an unexpected inability to obtain needed liquidity.\nLiquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due. The liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests, to accommodate possible outflows in deposits, and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities and is essential to a financial institution\u2019s business. The ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of its balance sheet structure, its ability to liquidate assets and its access to alternative sources of funds. The Company seeks to ensure that its funding needs are met by maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity through asset and liability management. In 2016, the Bank also secured liquidity under the advance program provided under terms offered by the FHLBC. If the Company or the Bank becomes unable to obtain funds when needed, it could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLoss of customer deposits due to increased competition could increase the Company\u2019s funding costs.\nThe Company relies on bank deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding. All federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on business demand deposit accounts were repealed as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, and, as a result, some financial institutions offer demand deposits to compete for customers. The Company competes with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. If the Company\u2019s competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits in response to interest rate changes initiated by the FRBC Open Market Committee or for other reasons of their choice, the Company\u2019s funding costs may increase, either because the Company raises its rates to avoid losing deposits or because the Company loses deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. Higher funding costs could reduce the Company\u2019s net interest margin and net interest income and could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s estimate of fair values for its investments may not be realizable if it were to sell these securities today.\nThe Company\u2019s available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value. The Company\u2019s held-to-maturity securities were carried at amortized cost.\nThe determination of fair value for securities categorized in Level 3 involves significant judgment due to the complexity of the factors contributing to the valuation, many of which are not readily observable in the market. Recent market disruptions and the resulting fluctuations in fair value have made the valuation process even more difficult and subjective. If the valuations are incorrect, it could harm the Company\u2019s financial results and financial condition.\nThe Company may be materially and adversely affected by the highly regulated environment in which the Company operates.\nThe Company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation, supervision and examination. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, FDIC funds, customers and the banking system as a whole, rather than the Company\u2019s stockholders. These regulations affect the Company\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, and growth, among other things.\nAs a bank holding company, the Company and the Bank are subject to extensive regulation and supervision, and undergo periodic examinations by its regulators, who have extensive discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks and bank holding companies. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil monetary penalties, and/or damage to the Company\u2019s reputation, which could have a material\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nadverse effect on the Company. Although the Company has policies and procedures designed to mitigate the risk of any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur.\nA more detailed description of the primary federal and state banking laws and regulations that affect the Company and the Bank is included in this Form 10-K under the section captioned \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d in Item 1. These laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time. For example, on July 21, 2010, the Dodd Frank Act was signed into law, which significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry. The Dodd Frank Act, together with the regulations to be developed thereunder, includes provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike, including several provisions that affect how community banks, thrifts and small bank and thrift holding companies will be regulated. In addition, the Federal Reserve, in recent years, has adopted numerous new regulations addressing banks\u2019 overdraft and mortgage lending practices. Further, the CFPB was established, with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws, and additional consumer protection legislation and regulatory activity is anticipated in the future. Any rules or regulations promulgated by the CFPB may increase our compliance costs and could limit our revenue from certain consumer products and services.\nThe financial services industry, as well as the broader economy, may be subject to new legislation, regulation, and government policy.\nAt this time, it is difficult to predict the legislative and regulatory changes that will result from the combination of a new President of the United States and the first year since 2010 in which both Houses of Congress and the White House have majority memberships from the same political party. Recently, however, both the new President and senior members of the House of Representatives have advocated for significant reduction of financial services regulation, to include amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act and structural changes to the CFPB. The new Administration and Congress also may cause broader economic changes due to changes in governing ideology and governing style. New appointments to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve could affect monetary policy and interest rates, and changes in fiscal policy could affect broader patterns of trade and economic growth. Future legislation, regulation, and government policy could affect the banking industry as a whole, including the Company\u2019s business and results of operations, in ways that are difficult to predict. In addition, the Company\u2019s results of operations also could be adversely affected by changes in the way in which existing statutes and regulations are interpreted or applied by courts and government agencies.\nWe could be required to establish a deferred tax asset valuation allowance and a corresponding charge against earnings if the federal corporate income tax rate is lowered or the federal corporate alternative minimum tax is eliminated, or if we experience a decrease in earnings.\nDeferred tax assets are reported as assets on the Company\u2019s balance sheet and represent the decrease in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) and tax credit carryforwards and because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by enacted tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $53.5 million, which included deferred tax assets for a federal net operating loss carryforward of $55.3 million that is expected to expire in 2031 thru 2033 and a $2.1 million alternative minimum tax credit carryforward that can be carried forward indefinitely. Tax credit carryforwards result in reductions to future tax liabilities. If it becomes more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be recognized. The President of the United States and the majority political party in the U.S. Congress have announced plans to lower the federal corporate income tax rate from its current level of 35% and to eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax. If these plans ultimately result in the enactment of new laws lowering the corporate income tax rate by a material amount and/or eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax, or if we sustain net losses, which the Company has done as recently as 2012, certain of the Company\u2019s deferred tax assets would need to be re-measured to evaluate the impact that the lower tax rate and/or the elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax or the net losses will have on the currently expected full utilization of the deferred tax assets. If any of these factors make it more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized, a valuation allowance will need to be recognized and this would result in a corresponding charge against the Company\u2019s earnings.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries could become subject to claims and litigation pertaining to the Company\u2019s or the Bank\u2019s fiduciary responsibility.\nCustomers make claims and on occasion take legal action pertaining to the Company\u2019s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities. Whether customer claims and legal action related to the Company\u2019s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal action are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, they may result in significant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of the Company and its products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nLoss of key employees may disrupt relationships with certain customers.\nThe Company\u2019s business is primarily relationship-driven in that many of its key employees have extensive customer or asset management relationships. Loss of key employees with such relationships may lead to the loss of business if the customers were to follow that employee to a competitor or if asset management expertise was not timely replaced. While the Company believes its relationships with its key personnel are strong, it cannot guarantee that all of its key personnel will remain with the organization. Loss of such key personnel could have a negative impact on the company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security and cyber-attacks, all if which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company relies heavily on internal and outsourced technologies, communications, and information systems to conduct its business. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Company collects, processes and retains sensitive and confidential information regarding our customers. As the Company\u2019s reliance on technology has increased, so have the potential risks of a technology-related operation interruption (such as disruptions in the Company\u2019s customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan, or other systems) or the occurrence of a cyber-attack (such as unauthorized access to the Company\u2019s systems). These risks have increased for all financial institutions as new technologies have emerged, including the use of the Internet and the expansion of telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions, and as the sophistication of organized criminals, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists and others have increased.\nIn addition to cyber-attacks or other security breaches involving the theft of sensitive and confidential information, hackers recently have engaged in attacks against large financial institutions, particularly denial of service attacks, that are designed to disrupt key business services, such as customer-facing web sites. The Company operates in an industry where otherwise effective preventive measures against security breaches become vulnerable as breach strategies change frequently and cyber-attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. It is possible that a cyber incident, such as a security breach, may be undetected for a period of time. However, applying guidance fromthe Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, the Company has identified security risks and employs risk mitigation controls. Following a layered security approach, the Company has analyzed and will continue to analyze security related to device specific considerations, user access topics, transaction-processing and network integrity. The Company expects that it will spend additional time and will incur additional cost going forward to modify and enhance protective measures and that effort and spending will continue to be required to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nThe Company also faces risks related to cyber-attacks and other security breaches in connection with credit card and debit card transactions that typically involve the transmission of sensitive information regarding the Company\u2019s customers through various third parties, including merchant acquiring banks, payment processors, payment card networks and its processors. Some of these parties have in the past been the target of security breaches and cyber-attacks. Because these third parties and related environments such as the point-of-sale are not under the Company\u2019s direct control future security breaches or cyber-attacks affecting any of these third parties could impact the Company and in some cases the Company may have exposure and suffer losses for breaches or attacks. The Company offers its customers protection against fraud and attendant losses for unauthorized use of debit cards in order to stay competitive in the market place. Offering such protection exposes the Company to potential losses which, in the event of a data breach at one or more retailers of considerable magnitude, may adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operation. Our planned rollout of EMV chip based debit cards in 2017 may produce transition risk in advance of the fully implemented change-over of our customers to these new EMV cards. Further cyber-attacks or other breaches in the future, whether affecting the Company or others, could intensify consumer concern and regulatory focus and result in reduced use of payment cards and increased costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. To the extent we are involved in any future cyber-attacks or other breaches, the Company\u2019s reputation could be affected with a potentially material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company is dependent upon outside third parties for the processing and handling of Company records and data.\nThe Company relies on software developed by third party vendors to process various Company transactions. In some cases, the Company has contracted with third parties to run their proprietary software on behalf of the Company at a location under the control of the third party. These systems include, but are not limited to, payroll, wealth management record keeping, and securities portfolio management. While the Company performs a review of controls instituted by the vendor over these programs in accordance with industry standards and institutes its own user controls, the Company must rely on the continued maintenance of the performance controls by these outside parties, including safeguards over the security of customer data. In addition, the Company creates backup copies of key processing output daily in the event of a failure on the part of any of these systems. Nonetheless, the Company may incur a temporary disruption in its ability to conduct its business or process its transactions, or incur damage to its reputation if a third party vendor fails to adequately maintain internal controls or institute necessary changes to systems. A disruption or breach of security may ultimately have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in a variety of litigation and other actions.\nCurrently, there are certain other legal proceedings pending against the Company and its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of any legal proceeding is inherently uncertain, based on information currently available, the Company\u2019s management believes that any liabilities arising from pending legal matters would not have a material adverse effect on the Bank or on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. However, if actual results differ from management\u2019s expectations, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nRisks Associated with the Company\u2019s Common Stock\nThe Company has not established a minimum dividend payment level, and it cannot ensure its ability to pay dividends in the future.\nFor several years prior to January 2014, the Company was under a Written Agreement with the Federal Reserve that included among other requirements and restrictions, limitations on the Company\u2019s payment of dividends on its common stock. Although the Written Agreement was terminated in January 2014, the Company only resumed paying dividends during the second quarter of 2016 on its common stock.\nDespite the termination of the Written Agreement, the Company is still subject to various restrictions on its ability to pay dividends imposed by the Federal Reserve. The Company is also subject to the limitations of the DGCL. The DGCL allows the Company to pay dividends only out of its surplus (as defined and computed in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL) or, if the Company has no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year.\nHolders of the Company\u2019s common stock are also only entitled to receive such dividends as the Company\u2019s board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments.\nThe trading volumes in the Company\u2019s common stock may not provide adequate liquidity for investors.\nShares of the Company\u2019s common stock are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market; however, the average daily trading volume in its common stock is less than that of most larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of a sufficient number of willing buyers and sellers of the common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which the Company has no control. Given the current daily average trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock, significant sales of the Company\u2019s common stock in a brief period of time, or the expectation of these sales, could cause a significant decline in the price of the Company\u2019s stock.\nThe trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock may be subject to continued significant fluctuations and volatility.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nactual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in its operating and financial results, particularly if such results vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors, including with respect to further loan losses the Company may incur;\n\u00b7\nannouncements regarding significant transactions in which the Company may engage;\n\u00b7\nmarket assessments regarding such transactions;\n\u00b7\nchanges or perceived changes in its operations or business prospects;\n\u00b7\nlegislative or regulatory changes affecting its industry generally or its businesses and operations;\n\u00b7\nthe failure of general market and economic conditions to stabilize and recover, particularly with respect to economic conditions in Illinois, and the pace of any such stabilization and recovery;\n\u00b7\nthe operating and share price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to the Company;\n\u00b7\nfuture offerings by the Company of debt, preferred stock or trust preferred securities, each of which would be senior to its common stock upon liquidation and for purposes of dividend distributions;\n\u00b7\nactions of its current stockholders, including future sales of common stock by existing stockholders and its directors and executive officers; and\n\u00b7\nother changes in U.S. or global financial markets, economies and market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity, credit or asset valuations or volatility.\nStock markets in general, and the Company\u2019s common stock in particular, have experienced significant volatility since 2007 and continue to experience significant price and volume volatility. As a result, the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may continue to be subject to similar market fluctuations that may or may not be related to its operating performance or prospects. Increased volatility could result in a decline in the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nCertain banking laws and the Company\u2019s governing documents may have an anti-takeover effect.\nCertain federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Company, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to the Company\u2019s stockholders. In addition, the Company has a classified board of directors and has adopted an Amended and Restated Rights Plan and Tax Benefits Preservation Plan as amended (the \u201cRights Plan\u201d), which is intended to discourage any person from acquiring 5% or more of the Company\u2019s outstanding stock (with certain limited exceptions), in order to help preserve the value of its deferred tax asset. The combination of these provisions may inhibit a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.", "PERMNO": 79851, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "OSBC"}
