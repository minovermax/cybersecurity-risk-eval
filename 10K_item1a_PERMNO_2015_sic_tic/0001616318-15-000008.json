{"cik": "1616318", "company": "Vista Outdoor Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-06-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nVista Outdoor is subject to a number of risks, including those related to domestic and international commercial sales. The material risks facing Vista Outdoor are discussed below.\nCompetition in our industry may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy, achieve profitability or maintain relationships with existing customers.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and we compete against manufacturers that have well-established brand names and strong market positions. Significant accessories competitors include major optics companies Leupold and Nikon, as well as Vortex Optics and Arnette, Oakley, OTIS, Revo, Safariland and others. Significant ammunition competitors include Remington Arms, Winchester Ammunition (a division of Olin Corporation) and various smaller manufacturers and importers, including Black Hills Ammunition, Fiocchi Ammunition, Hornady, PMC, Rio Ammunition, Selliers & Bellott and Wolf. Significant firearms competitors include Mossberg, Marlin, Ruger, Remington and Winchester.\nCompetition in the markets in which we operate is based on a number of factors, including price, quality, product innovation, performance, reliability, styling, product features and warranties, as well as sales and marketing programs. Competition could cause price reductions, reduced profits or losses or loss of market share, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Certain of our competitors may be more diversified than us or may have financial and marketing resources that are substantially greater than ours, which may allow these competitors to invest more heavily in intellectual property, product development and advertising. Since many of our competitors also source their products from third parties, our ability to obtain a cost advantage through sourcing is reduced.\nCertain of our competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower profit margins to compete with us. Further, retailers often demand that suppliers reduce their prices on mature products, which could lead to lower margins.\nInternationally, our products typically face more competition where foreign competitors manufacture and market products in their respective countries. This allows those competitors to sell products at lower prices, which could adversely affect our competitiveness. In addition, our products compete with many other sporting and recreational products for the discretionary spending of consumers. Failure to effectively compete with these other competitors or alternative products could have a material adverse effect on our performance.\nOur results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to forecast demand accurately for our products.\nWe often schedule internal production and place orders for products with third party suppliers before receiving firm orders from our customers. For example, the ammunition products supply agreement with Orbital ATK offers an incentive for us to place a large advance order. Under such agreement, if we place a sizeable order for certain ammunition products prior to the start of the fiscal year in which they are to be delivered, during such fiscal year, subject to certain exceptions, Orbital ATK will only sell small-caliber ammunition products manufactured at its Lake City plant to us and the U.S. Department of Defense. Therefore, if we fail to accurately forecast customer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of products to deliver to our customers. Factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products include:\n\u2022 an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products or for the products of our competitors;\n\u2022 our failure to accurately forecast customer acceptance of new products;\n\u2022 new product introductions by competitors;\n\u2022 changes in our relationships with customers;\n\u2022 changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of orders or a reduction or increase in the rate of reorders placed by retailers;\n\u2022 changes in laws and regulations governing the activities for which we sell products, such as hunting and shooting sports; and\n\u2022 weak economic conditions or consumer confidence, which could reduce demand for discretionary items such as our products.\nOn the one hand, inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. On the other hand, if we underestimate demand for our products, our manufacturing facilities or third party suppliers may not be able to create products that meet customer demand, and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues, as well as damage to our reputation and customer relationships. We cannot assure you that we will be able to manage inventory levels successfully to meet future order and reorder requirements.\nOur sales are highly dependent on purchases by several large retail customers, and we may be adversely affected by the loss of, or any significant decline in sales to, one or more of these customers.\nThe U.S. retail industry serving the outdoor recreation market has become relatively concentrated. Sales to the top ten retail customers accounted for approximately 40% of our consolidated net sales in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. Further consolidation in the U.S. retail industry could increase the concentration of our retail store customer base in the future.\nAlthough we have long-established relationships with many of our retail store customers, as is typical in the markets in which we compete, we do not have long-term purchase agreements with our customers. As such, we are dependent on individual purchase orders. As a result, these retail store customers would be able to cancel their orders, change purchase quantities from forecast volumes, delay purchases, change other terms of our business relationship or cease to purchase our products entirely. The loss of any one or more of our retail store customers or significant or numerous cancellations, reductions, delays in purchases or changes in business practices by our retail store customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have historically relied on Orbital ATK for certain of our ammunition and gun powder products. After the Spin-Off, our relationship with Orbital ATK has changed and may adversely affect our supply of these products.\nWe rely on Orbital ATK for certain of our ammunition and gun powder products. Concurrently with the Spin-Off, we entered into a supply agreement with a subsidiary of Orbital ATK pursuant to which the Lake City plant operated by such subsidiary will manufacture and supply certain of our requirements for 5.56mm (including .223 caliber), 7.62mm and .50 caliber ammunition products, subject to certain exceptions. We also entered into an additional Supply Agreement pursuant to which a subsidiary of Orbital ATK will manufacture and supply certain of our gun powder products. The Supply Agreements provide that, following the Distribution, (1) Orbital ATK and its subsidiaries will manufacture and supply all of our requirements for 5.56mm (including .223 caliber), 7.62mm and .50 caliber cartridge ammunition products, in each case excluding any frangible ammunition products (referred to as the \"ammunition products\") and certain Alliant canister gun powder products (referred to as the \"gun powder products\"), subject to capacity limitations and, in the case of ammunition products, the priority rights of the U.S. Department of Defense and (2) we will purchase all of our requirements for such products from Orbital ATK and its subsidiaries (and will not purchase such products from another party or manufacture such products ourselves), subject to the right to \"cure\" if Orbital ATK and its subsidiaries fail to perform. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we generally may continue to manufacture certain ammunition currently manufactured by the Shooting Sports segment.\nIf our ammunition products order for a given fiscal year meets or exceeds an agreed amount, during such fiscal year, subject to certain exceptions, Orbital ATK and its subsidiaries will only be permitted to sell small caliber ammunition products produced at its Lake City plant to us and the U.S. Department of Defense. If our ammunition products order for a given fiscal year is less than such amount, then Orbital ATK and its subsidiaries may sell those small caliber ammunition products to any other party during such fiscal year. Orbital ATK and its subsidiaries will only be permitted to sell cannister gun powder products to us, irrespective of the amount of gun powder products ordered by us. The ammunition products Supply Agreement will also prohibit us from reselling 5.56mm (including .223 caliber), 7.62mm and .50 caliber ammunition products (excluding any frangible ammunition products) to the U.S. Department of Defense, although we generally may continue to sell to the U.S. Department of Defense certain ammunition that the Shooting Sports segment currently sells to the U.S. Department of Defense.\nThe initial term of each Supply Agreement is three years. The ammunition products Supply Agreement is renewable for an additional three-year term and one further term thereafter ending on September 30, 2023, while the gun powder products Supply Agreement is renewable for additional one-year terms. After the Spin-Off, our relationship with Orbital ATK has changed and such change may affect our supply of ammunition products and gun powder products. We cannot assure you that we will be able to renew the Supply Agreements or that we will be able to source ammunition products or gun powder products from another supplier on favorable terms or at all. If we fail to maintain an adequate supply of ammunition products and gun powder products, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSignificant supplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality issues or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products.\nOur reliance on third party suppliers for various product components and finished goods exposes us to volatility in the availability, quality and price of these product components and finished goods. A disruption in deliveries from our third party suppliers, capacity constraints, production disruptions, price increases or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. Quality issues experienced by third party suppliers can also adversely affect the quality and effectiveness of our products and result in liability and reputational harm.\nFollowing the Spin-Off, we rely on Orbital ATK for certain of our ammunition and gun powder products. If the production capabilities of Orbital ATK's Lake City plant or Radford plant change such that we fail to maintain an adequate supply of ammunition and gun powder products, our operating costs could increase and the competitive positions of our ammunition and gun powder products could be adversely impacted.\nWe face risks relating to our international business that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing international markets and to capitalize on growth in existing and new international markets is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including:\n\u2022 issues related to managing international operations;\n\u2022 potentially adverse tax developments;\n\u2022 lack of sufficient protection for intellectual property in some countries;\n\u2022 currency exchange and import and export controls;\n\u2022 social, political and economic instability in the countries in which we operate;\n\u2022 local laws and regulations, including those governing labor, product safety and environmental protection; and\n\u2022 limitations on our ability to efficiently repatriate cash from our foreign operations.\nAny one or more of these risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other applicable anti-corruption legislation, as well as export controls and trade sanctions, could result in fines or criminal penalties.\nThe international nature of our business exposes us to trade sanctions and other restrictions imposed by the U.S. and other governments. The U.S. Departments of Justice, Commerce, Treasury and other agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against companies for violations of export controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, anti-boycott provisions and other federal statutes, sanctions and regulations and, increasingly, similar or more restrictive foreign laws, rules and regulations, which may also apply to us. By virtue of these laws and regulations, and under laws and regulations in other jurisdictions, we may be obliged to limit our business activities, we may incur costs for compliance programs and we may be subject to enforcement actions or penalties for noncompliance. In recent years, U.S. and foreign governments have increased their oversight and enforcement activities with respect to these laws and we expect the relevant agencies to continue to increase these activities. A violation of these laws, sanctions or regulations could result in restrictions on our exports, civil and criminal fines or penalties and could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur revenues and results of operations may fluctuate unexpectedly from quarter-to-quarter, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur revenues and results of operations have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to various factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 market acceptance of our products and services;\n\u2022 the timing of large domestic and international orders;\n\u2022 future cancellation of existing orders;\n\u2022 the outcome of any existing or future litigation;\n\u2022 adverse publicity surrounding our products, the safety of our products or the use of our products;\n\u2022 changes in our sales mix;\n\u2022 new product introduction costs;\n\u2022 complexity in our integrated supply chain;\n\u2022 increased raw material expenses;\n\u2022 changes in amount and/or timing of our operating expenses; and\n\u2022 changes in laws and regulations that may affect the marketability of our products.\nAs a result of these and other factors, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful in the short term, and our performance in a particular period may not be indicative of our performance in any future period.\nSeasonality and weather conditions may cause our results of operations to vary from quarter to quarter.\nBecause many of the products we sell are used for seasonal outdoor sporting activities, our results of operations may be significantly impacted by unseasonable weather conditions in our markets. For example, our winter sport accessories sales are dependent on cold winter weather and snowfall in our markets, and can be negatively impacted by unseasonably warm or dry weather in our markets. Conversely, sales of our spring products and summer products, such as golf accessories, can be adversely impacted by unseasonably cold or wet weather in those periods. Accordingly, our sales results and financial condition will typically suffer when weather patterns do not conform to seasonal norms.\nSales of our hunting accessories are highest during the months of August through December due to shipments around the fall hunting season and holidays. In addition, sales of our ammunition have historically been lower in our first fiscal quarter. We cannot assure you that the seasonality of our sales will not increase in the future. Seasonal variations in our results of operations may reduce our cash on hand, increase our inventory levels and extend our accounts receivable collection periods. This in turn may cause us to increase our debt levels and interest expense to fund our working capital requirements.\nOur success depends upon our ability to introduce new products into the market that meet our high standards and match customer preferences.\nOur efforts to introduce new products into the market may not be successful, and any new products that we introduce may not result in customer or market acceptance. We both develop and source new products that we believe will match customer preferences. The development of new products is a lengthy and costly process and may not result in the development of a successful product. In addition, the sourcing of our products is dependent, in part, on our relationships with our third party suppliers. If we are unable to maintain these relationships, we may not be able to continue to source products at competitive prices that both meet our standards and appeal to our customers. Failure to develop or source and introduce new products that consumers want to buy could decrease our sales, operating margins and market share and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nEven if we are able to develop or source new products, our efforts to introduce new products may be costly and ineffective. When introducing a new product, we incur expenses and expend resources to market, promote and sell the new product. New products that we introduce into the marketplace may be unsuccessful or may achieve success that does not meet our expectations for a variety of reasons, including failure to predict market demand, delays in introduction, unfavorable cost comparisons with alternative products and unfavorable performance. Significant expenses related to new products that prove to be unsuccessful for any reason will adversely affect our results of operations.\nSome of our products contain licensed, third party technology that provides important product functionality and features. The loss or inability to obtain any such license could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur products may contain technology licensed from third parties that provides important product functionality and features. We cannot assure you that we will have continued access to this technology. For example, if the licensing company ceases to exist, either from bankruptcy, dissolution or purchase by a competitor, we may lose access to important third party technology and may not be able to obtain replacement technology on favorable terms or at all. In addition, legal actions, such as intellectual property actions, brought against the licensing company could impact our future access to the technology. Any of these actions could negatively impact our technology licensing, thereby reducing the functionality and features of our products, and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe manufacture and sell products that create exposure to potential product liability, warranty liability or personal injury claims and litigation.\nOur products expose us to potential product liability, warranty liability or personal injury claims and litigation relating to the use or misuse of our products. If successful, such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about our products.\nDefects in our products could reduce demand for our products and result in a decrease in sales, delays in market acceptance and damage to our reputation.\nComplex components and assemblies used in our products may contain undetected defects that are subsequently discovered at any point in the life of the product. In addition, we obtain many of our products and component parts from third party suppliers and may not be able to detect defects in such products or component parts until after they are sold. Defects in our products may result in a loss of sales, delay in market acceptance and damage to our reputation and increased warranty costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and could incur fines, penalties and other costs and liabilities under such requirements.\nLike many other manufacturers and distributors of consumer products, we are required to comply with a wide variety of laws, rules and regulations, including those surrounding labor and employment law, environmental law, the export and import of our products, taxation and consumer products generally. These laws, rules and regulations currently impose significant compliance requirements on our business, and more restrictive laws, rules and regulations may be adopted in the future.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing the discharge, treatment, storage, transportation, remediation and disposal of certain materials and wastes, and restoration of damages to the environment, as well as health and safety matters. We could incur substantial costs, including remediation costs, resource restoration costs, fines, penalties and third party property damage or personal injury claims as a result of liabilities under or violations of such laws and regulations or the permits required thereunder. While environmental laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, the ultimate cost of environmental liabilities is difficult to accurately predict and we could incur material additional costs as a result of requirements or obligations imposed or liabilities identified in the future.\nAs a manufacturer and distributor of consumer products, we are subject to the Consumer Products Safety Act, which empowers the Consumer Products Safety Commission to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous. Under certain circumstances, the Consumer Products Safety Commission could require us to repurchase or recall one or more of our products. In addition, laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some cities and states, as well as in other countries in which we sell our products, and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future. Any repurchase or recall of our products could be costly to us and could damage our reputation. If we were required to remove, or we voluntarily removed, our products from the market, our reputation could be tarnished and we could have large quantities of finished products that we are unable to sell.\nWe are also subject to the rules and regulations of the ATF. If we fail to comply with ATF rules and regulations, the ATF may limit our growth or business activities, levy fines against us or, ultimately, revoke our license to do business. Our business, as well as the business of all producers and marketers of ammunition and firearms, is also subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and protocols. Applicable laws:\n\u2022 require the licensing of all persons manufacturing, exporting, importing or selling firearms and ammunition as a business;\n\u2022 require background checks for purchasers of firearms;\n\u2022 impose waiting periods between the purchase of a firearm and the delivery of a firearm;\n\u2022 prohibit the sale of firearms to certain persons, such as those below a certain age and persons with criminal records;\n\u2022 regulate the use and storage of gun powder or other energetic materials;\n\u2022 regulate the interstate sale of certain firearms;\n\u2022 prohibit the interstate mail-order sale of firearms;\n\u2022 regulate our employment of personnel with criminal convictions; and\n\u2022 restrict access to firearm manufacturing facilities for individuals from other countries or with criminal convictions.\nAlso, the export of our products is controlled by ITAR and EAR. The ITAR implements the provisions of the Arms Export Control Act and is enforced by the U.S. Department of State. The EAR implements the provisions of the Export Administration Act and is enforced by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Among their many provisions, the ITAR and the EAR require a license application for the export of many of our products. In addition, the ITAR requires congressional approval for any firearms export application with a total value of $1 million or higher. Further, because our manufacturing process includes certain toxic, flammable and explosive chemicals, we are subject to the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards, as administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which require that we take additional reporting and security measures related to our manufacturing process.\nSeveral states currently have laws in effect that are similar to, and in certain cases, more restrictive than, these federal laws. Compliance with all of these regulations is costly and time-consuming. Inadvertent violation of any of these regulations could cause us to incur fines and penalties and may also lead to restrictions on our ability to manufacture and sell our products and services and to import or export the products we sell.\nChanges in government policies and firearms legislation could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe sale, purchase, ownership and use of firearms are subject to numerous and varied federal, state and local governmental regulations. Federal laws governing firearms include the National Firearms Act, the Federal Firearms Act, the Arms Export Control Act and the Gun Control Act of 1968. These laws generally govern the manufacture, import, export, sale and possession of firearms and ammunition. We hold all necessary licenses to legally sell firearms and ammunition in the United States.\nCurrently, the federal legislature and several state legislatures are considering additional legislation relating to the regulation of firearms and ammunition. These proposed bills are extremely varied. If enacted, such legislation could effectively ban or severely limit the sale of affected firearms or ammunition. In addition, if such restrictions are enacted and are incongruent, we could find it difficult, expensive or even practically impossible to comply with them, which could impede new product development and the distribution of existing products. We cannot assure you that the regulation of our business activities will not become more restrictive in the future and that any such restriction will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA significant disruption in our computer systems or a cyber security breach could adversely affect our operations.\nWe rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our ordering, pricing, inventory replenishment and other processes. Our systems could be subject to damage or interruption from various sources, including power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber security breaches, vandalism, severe weather conditions, catastrophic\nevents and human error, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and we may experience loss of critical data and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any compromise of our data security could also result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, loss or misuse of the information and a loss of confidence in our data security measures, which could harm our business.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with the recent acquisitions of Bushnell and Savage Arms, which could adversely affect our future financial results.\nIn the 2014 fiscal year, we acquired Bushnell, a leading global designer, marketer and distributor of branded sports optics, outdoor accessories and performance eyewear, and also acquired Caliber Company, the parent company of Savage Arms, a leading manufacturer of sporting long guns. The acquisitions of Bushnell and Savage Arms involve a number of risks, including the risk that the anticipated benefits and cost synergies from the acquisitions may not be fully realized or may take longer than expected to realize, costs and difficulties related to the integration of the two acquired companies with our operations and unanticipated liabilities or contingencies. For example, we are currently involved in litigation in connection with the Bushnell acquisition, pursuant to which we have sued the seller of Bushnell in connection with the working capital purchase price adjustment. In addition, during fiscal 2015 we recorded an impairment associated with the acquisition of Savage Arms of $52 million of goodwill and tradename assets, which relates to the current market correction impacting demand for firearms. These and other risks relating to the Bushnell and Savage Arms acquisitions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may pursue or complete acquisitions, or other transactions, that represent additional risk and could impact future financial results.\nOur business strategy includes the potential for future acquisitions or other transactions. Acquisitions involve a number of risks including integration of the acquired company with our operations and unanticipated liabilities or contingencies related to the acquired company. We cannot assure you that the expected benefits of any future acquisitions or other transactions will be realized. Costs could be incurred on pursuits or proposed acquisitions that have not yet or may not close which could significantly impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, after any acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise which adversely affect our anticipated returns or which are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Even after careful integration efforts, actual results of operations may vary significantly from initial estimates. For example, in fiscal year 2015 we recorded an impairment to the goodwill associated with our acquisition of the Savage business, which impairment related to the current market correction impacting demand for firearms. Furthermore, we may engage in other strategic business transactions. Such transactions could cause unanticipated costs and difficulties, may not achieve intended results and may require significant time and attention from management, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business is highly dependent upon our brand recognition and reputation, and the failure to maintain or enhance our brand recognition or reputation would likely have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur brand recognition and reputation are critical aspects of our business. We believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands as well as our reputation are critical to retaining existing customers and attracting new customers. We also believe that the importance of our brand recognition and reputation will continue to increase as competition in the markets in which we compete continues to develop.\nOur future growth and profitability will depend in large part upon the effectiveness and efficiency of our advertising, promotion, public relations and marketing programs. These brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue and the effectiveness of these activities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022 determine the appropriate creative message, media mix and markets for advertising, marketing and promotional initiatives and expenditures;\n\u2022 identify the most effective and efficient level of spending in each market, medium and specific media vehicle; and\n\u2022 effectively manage marketing costs, including creative and media expenses, in order to maintain acceptable customer acquisition costs.\nIf we implement new marketing and advertising strategies, we may utilize marketing and advertising channels with significantly higher costs than our current channels, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Implementing new marketing and advertising strategies could also increase the risk of devoting significant capital and other resources to endeavors that do not prove to be cost effective. We also may incur marketing and advertising expenses significantly in advance of the time we anticipate recognizing revenue associated with such expenses, and our marketing and advertising expenditures may not generate sufficient levels of brand awareness or result in increased revenue. Even if our marketing and advertising expenses result in increased revenue, the increase in revenue might not offset our related marketing and advertising expenditures. If we are unable to maintain our marketing and advertising channels on cost-effective terms or replace or supplement existing marketing and advertising channels with similarly or more cost-effective channels, our marketing and advertising expenses could increase substantially, our customer base could be adversely affected and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe may incur substantial litigation costs to protect our intellectual property, and if we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may lose our competitive advantage. We may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims, which could cause us to incur litigation costs and divert management attention from our business.\nOur future success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property. Our protective measures, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret protection and internet identity registrations, may prove inadequate to protect our proprietary rights and market advantage. The right to stop others from misusing our trademarks and service marks in commerce depends, to some extent, on our ability to show evidence of enforcement of our rights against such misuse in commerce. Our efforts to stop improper use, if insufficient, may lead to loss of trademark and service mark rights, brand loyalty and notoriety among our customers and prospective customers. The scope of any patent to which we have or may obtain rights may not prevent others from developing and selling competing products. In addition, our patents may be held invalid upon challenge, or others may claim rights in, or ownership of, our patents. Moreover, we may become subject to litigation with parties that claim, among other matters, that we infringed their patents or other intellectual property rights. The defense and prosecution of patent and other intellectual property claims are both costly and time-consuming, and could result in a material adverse effect on our business and financial position.\nAlso, any intellectual property infringement claims against us, with or without merit, could be costly and time-consuming to defend and divert our management's attention from our business. If our products were found to infringe a third party's proprietary rights, we could be forced to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements in order to be able to sell our products or discontinue use of the protected technology. Such royalty and licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Rights holders may demand payment for past infringements or force us to accept costly license terms or discontinue use of protected technology or works of authorship.\nWe may become involved in litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Other companies, including our competitors, may develop intellectual property that is similar or superior to our intellectual property, duplicate our intellectual property or design around our patents, and may have or obtain patents or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products. Effective intellectual property protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries in which we sell products or from which competing products may be sold.\nUnauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise use aspects of our intellectual property and products that we regard as proprietary. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the United States or abroad may prove to be inadequate, and competitors may be able to develop similar intellectual property independently. If our intellectual property protection is insufficient to protect our intellectual property rights, we could face increased competition in the markets for our products.\nShould any of our competitors file patent applications or obtain patents that claim inventions also claimed by us, we may choose to participate in an interference proceeding to determine the right to a patent for these inventions because our business would be harmed if we fail to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights. Even if the outcome is favorable, this proceeding could result in substantial costs to us and disrupt our business.\nIn the future, we also may need to file lawsuits to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. This litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nShortages of, and price increases for, components, parts, raw materials and other supplies may delay or reduce our sales and increase our costs, thereby harming our results of operations.\nAlthough we manufacture many of the components for our products, we purchase from third parties some important components and parts, including but not limited to bolt carriers, rifle receivers, magazines, barrels, rifle stocks and bulk gun powder. The costs of these components and parts are affected by commodity prices and are, therefore, subject to price volatility caused by weather, market conditions and other factors that are not predictable or within our control. We also use numerous commodity materials in producing and testing our products, including copper, zinc, steel, wood, lead, and plastics. We cannot assure you that commodity prices will not increase, and any such increase in commodity prices may harm our results of operations.\nOur inability to obtain sufficient quantities of components, parts, raw materials and other supplies from independent sources necessary for the production of our products could result in reduced or delayed sales or lost orders. Any delay in or loss of sales or orders could adversely impact our results of operations. Many of the components, parts, raw materials and other supplies used in the production of our products are available only from a limited number of suppliers. We do not have long-term supply contracts with some of these suppliers. As a result, we could be subject to increased costs, supply interruptions or orders and difficulties in obtaining materials. Our suppliers also may encounter difficulties or increased costs in obtaining the materials necessary to produce their products that we use in our products. The time lost in seeking and acquiring new sources could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIncreases in energy costs would increase our operating costs and could have an adverse effect on our earnings.\nHigher prices for electricity, natural gas and fuel increase our production and shipping costs. A significant shortage, increased prices or interruptions in the availability of these energy sources would increase the costs of producing and delivering products to our customers, and would be likely to negatively affect our earnings. Energy costs have varied significantly during recent fiscal years and remain a volatile element of our costs.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business.\nA disruption or failure of our systems or operations in the event of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services or performing other mission-critical functions. A catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could harm our ability to conduct normal business operations and our results of operations.\nIn addition, damage or disruption to manufacturing and distribution capabilities of us or our suppliers because of a major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. In addition, failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.\nSome of our products involve the manufacture or handling of a variety of explosive and flammable materials. From time to time, these activities have resulted in incidents that have temporarily shut down or otherwise disrupted some manufacturing processes, causing production delays and resulting in liability for workplace injuries and fatalities. We have safety and loss prevention programs that require detailed pre-construction reviews of process changes and new operations, along with routine safety audits of operations involving explosive materials, to mitigate such incidents, as well as a variety of insurance policies. We cannot assure you, however, that we will not experience similar incidents in the future or that any similar incidents will not result in production delays or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nGeneral economic conditions affect our results of operations.\nOur revenues are affected by economic conditions and consumer confidence worldwide, but especially in the United States. In times of economic uncertainty, consumers tend to defer expenditures for discretionary items, which affects demand for our products. Moreover, our businesses are cyclical in nature, and their success is impacted by general economic conditions and specific economic conditions affecting the regions and markets we serve, the overall level of consumer confidence in the economy and discretionary income levels. Any substantial deterioration in general economic conditions that diminish consumer confidence or discretionary income could reduce our sales and adversely affect our financial results. Moreover, declining economic conditions create the potential for future impairments of goodwill and other intangible and long-lived assets that may negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations. The impact of weak consumer credit markets, corporate restructurings, layoffs, high unemployment rates, declines in the value of investments and residential real estate, higher fuel prices and increases in federal and state taxation all can negatively affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, in recent periods sluggish economies and consumer uncertainty regarding future economic prospects in our key markets has had an adverse effect on the financial health of certain of our customers, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of the customer\u2019s financial condition, generally without requiring collateral, which increases our exposure to the risk of uncollectable receivables. In addition, we face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty. We may reduce our level of business with customers and distributors experiencing financial difficulties and may not be able to replace that business with other customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nFailure to attract and retain key personnel could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur future success will depend in part on the continued service of key personnel and our ability to attract, retain and develop key managers, designers, sales and information technology professionals and others. We face intense competition for these individuals worldwide, and there is a significant concentration of our competitors in and around our headquarters in Utah. We may not be able to attract qualified new employees or retain existing employees, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition, our ability to maintain our competitive position is dependent to a large degree on the efforts and skills of our senior management team, including Mark DeYoung, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Stephen Nolan, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The loss of Mr. DeYoung, Mr. Nolan or one or more members of our senior management may significantly impair our business. In addition, many of our senior executives have strong industry reputations, which aid us in identifying commercial, financing and strategic acquisition opportunities, and having such opportunities brought to us. The loss of the services of one or more of these key personnel could materially and adversely affect our operations because of diminished relationships with customers, lenders and industry participants.\nOur results of operations could be impacted by unanticipated changes in tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities.\nOur business operates in many locations under government jurisdictions that impose income taxes. Changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain revenues or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. In addition, audits by income tax authorities could result in unanticipated increases in our income tax expense.\nWe may need to raise additional capital, and we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available.\nWe need to fund our ongoing working capital, capital expenditure and financing requirements through cash flows from operations and new sources of financing. Our ability to obtain future financing will depend, among other things, on our financial condition or results of operations as well as on the condition of the capital markets or other credit markets at the time we seek financing. Increased volatility and disruptions in the financial markets could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain financing. We cannot assure you that, as a new public company, we will have access to the capital markets on terms we find acceptable or at all.\nThe terms of our Credit Agreement restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to incur debt that we may need to fund initiatives in response to changes in our business, the industries in which we operate, the economy and governmental regulations.\nOur Credit Agreement contains a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and limits our ability to engage in actions that may be in our long-term best interests, including restrictions on our and our subsidiaries' ability to:\n\u2022 incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or sell disqualified or preferred stock;\n\u2022 pay dividends on, make distributions in respect of, repurchase or redeem, capital stock;\n\u2022 make investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022 sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of certain assets;\n\u2022 create liens;\n\u2022 enter into sale/leaseback transactions;\n\u2022 enter into agreements restricting the ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany transfers;\n\u2022 consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our or our subsidiaries' assets;\n\u2022 enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022 prepay, repurchase or redeem certain kinds of indebtedness;\n\u2022 issue or sell stock of our subsidiaries; and\n\u2022 significantly change the nature of our business.\nIn addition, the Credit Agreement has financial covenants that require us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than 3.00 to 1.00 and to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 3.50 to 1.00 or less. Our ability to meet these financial covenants may be affected by events beyond our control.\nAs a result of all of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022 limited in how we conduct our business and pursue our strategy;\n\u2022 unable to raise additional debt or equity financing that we may require to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u2022 unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nIf we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the Credit Agreement, the lenders could proceed against the collateral that secures the indebtedness. In the event our creditors accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nSubstantially all of our long-term indebtedness consists of term loans with variable rates of interest that expose us to interest rate risk. Furthermore, any amounts drawn under the revolving credit facility available under our Credit Agreement will accrue interest at variable rates. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed could remain the same, and our net income and cash flows will correspondingly decrease. At our current level of indebtedness of $350 million under the Credit Agreement, a change of 1/8 of one percent in interest rates on our variable rate indebtedness would result in a $0.4 million change in annual estimated interest expense. Even if we enter into interest rate swaps in the future in order to reduce future interest rate volatility, we may not elect to maintain such interest rate swaps with respect to any of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results.\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015, approximately 18% of our revenue was generated from sales outside the United States. This revenue (and the related expense) is often transacted in foreign currencies or valued based on a currency other than U.S. dollars. For the purposes of financial reporting, this revenue is translated into U.S. dollars. Resulting gains and losses from foreign currency fluctuations are therefore included in our consolidated and combined financial statements. As a result, when the U.S. dollar strengthens against certain foreign currencies, including the Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar and other major currencies, as it did appreciably in 2014, our reportable revenue in U.S. dollars generated from sales made in foreign currencies may decrease substantially. As a result, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe level of returns on pension and postretirement plan assets, changes in interest rates and other factors could affect our earnings and cash flows.\nOur earnings may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense or income recorded for employee benefit plans, primarily pension plans and other postretirement plans. Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States require us to calculate income or expense for the plans using actuarial valuations. These valuations are based on assumptions made relating to financial market and other economic conditions. Changes in key economic indicators can result in changes in these assumptions. The key fiscal year-end assumptions used to estimate pension and postretirement benefit expense or income for the following fiscal year are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the rate of increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates and the health care cost trend rate. We are required to remeasure our plan assets and benefit obligations annually, which may result in a significant change to equity through other comprehensive income (loss). Our pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense can also be affected by legislation or other regulatory actions. Additional information on how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies can be found under \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition or Results of Operations-Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments.\"\nNew regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses.\nThe SEC has adopted additional disclosure requirements related to certain minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo and surrounding countries, or \"conflict minerals,\" that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by an SEC reporting company. The minerals that the final rules cover are commonly referred to as \"3TG\" and include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold. Implementation of the new disclosure requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of some of the minerals that we use in the manufacture of our products. Our supply chain is complex, and we may not be able to conclusively verify whether conflict minerals are used in our products or whether our products are \"conflict free.\" We could incur significant costs related to the compliance process, including potential difficulty or added costs in satisfying the disclosure requirements.\nA portion of our workforce belongs to a union. Failure to successfully negotiate or renew the collective bargaining agreement, or any strikes, slow-downs or other labor-related disruptions, could adversely affect our operations and could result in increased costs that impair our financial performance.\nApproximately 4.1% of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, which expires on June 30, 2017. Strikes, slow-downs or other labor-related disruptions could occur if we are unable to either negotiate or renew our collective bargaining agreement on satisfactory terms, which could adversely impact our results of operations. The terms and conditions of new or renegotiated agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency.\nRisks Relating to the Spin-Off and Ownership of our Common Stock\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Spin-Off.\nWe believe that, as an independent, publicly traded company, we will be able to, among other things, better focus our financial and operational resources on our specific business, implement and maintain a capital structure designed to meet our specific needs, design and implement corporate strategies and policies that are targeted to our business, more effectively respond to industry dynamics and create effective incentives for our management and employees that are more closely tied to our business performance. By separating from Orbital ATK, however, we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events. In addition, we may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company in the time we expect, if at all. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to make, on a timely or cost-effective basis, the changes necessary to operate as an independent, publicly traded company, and we may experience increased costs after the Spin-Off.\nWe historically operated as part of Orbital ATK's broader corporate organization, and Orbital ATK provided various corporate services for us, including information technology, tax administration, treasury activities, accounting, benefits administration, legal and ethics and compliance program administration. Following the Spin-Off, Orbital ATK has no obligation to provide us with assistance other than the transition services to be provided under the Transition Services Agreement. The term of the Transition Services Agreement is for 12 months (except in the case of tax services, which is generally for 18\nmonths). Once the Transition Services Agreement terminates, we will need to provide the covered services internally or obtain them from unaffiliated third parties. We may be unable to replace these services in a timely manner or on terms and conditions as favorable as those we receive from Orbital ATK. In addition, the services to be provided under the Transition Services Agreement do not include every service that we have received from Orbital ATK in the past. Accordingly, immediately following the Spin-Off, we have had to provide internally or obtain from unaffiliated third parties such other services. Because our business has historically operated as part of the wider Orbital ATK organization, we may be unable to successfully establish the infrastructure or implement the changes necessary to operate independently, or may incur additional costs that could adversely affect our business. If we fail to obtain the quality of services necessary to operate effectively or incur greater costs in obtaining these services, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we may incur increased costs after the Spin-Off as a result of the loss of synergies we enjoyed from operating as part of Orbital ATK. Following the Spin-Off, we are responsible for the additional costs associated with being an independent, publicly-traded company, including costs related to corporate governance, investor and public relations and public reporting. We also may face reduced purchasing power with respect to certain enterprise-wide purchases, such as certain third-party services, certain off-the-shelf software licenses and other information technology hardware and software. Further, as a standalone, publicly-traded company, our ability to borrow money in the capital markets will be measured based upon our standalone financial position and performance and conditions of the outdoor sports and recreation markets, without any consideration of Orbital ATK's Aerospace and Defense Group. Therefore, we may experience higher borrowing costs following the Spin-Off.\nOur consolidated and combined financial statements reflect our consolidated operations as a separate stand-alone entity beginning on February 9, 2015. Our results for periods presented in this Annual Report on 10-K prior to the Spin-Off have been prepared on a stand-alone basis and are derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Orbital ATK, and this information does not necessarily reflect the results of operations and financial position we would have achieved as an independent, publicly traded company during the periods presented, or those that we will achieve in the future.\nWe may have been able to receive better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we receive in our agreements with Orbital ATK.\nWe entered certain agreements with Orbital ATK in connection our separation from Orbital ATK, including the Transaction Agreement, Transition Services Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement and the Supply Agreements. These agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm's-length negotiations among unaffiliated third parties. We may have received better terms from third parties because third parties may have competed with each other to win our business.\nWe may be unable to take certain actions because such actions could jeopardize the tax-free status of the Spin-Off or the Merger, and such restrictions could be significant.\nUnder the Tax Matters Agreement entered into by Orbital ATK and Vista Outdoor, we are prohibited from taking actions that could reasonably be expected to cause the Spin-Off to be taxable or to jeopardize the conclusions of the opinions of counsel received by Orbital ATK.\nIn particular, for two years after the Spin-Off, we may not:\n\u2022 liquidate, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise;\n\u2022 redeem or otherwise repurchase our capital stock, subject to certain exceptions provided by the Tax Matters Agreement including the recently approved share repurchase program;\n\u2022 cease to be engaged in the active conduct of, or sell or transfer more than 30% of the gross assets or gross consolidated assets of, the sporting business; or\n\u2022 enter into any agreement, understanding or arrangement or engage in any substantial negotiations with respect to any transaction involving the acquisition, issuance, repurchase or change of ownership of 30% or more of our capital stock, in each case together with options or other rights in respect of that capital stock, subject to certain exceptions relating to employee compensation arrangements, open market stock repurchases and stockholder rights plans.\nIf the Spin-Off does not qualify as a tax-free spin-off under Section 355 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Code\"), including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of our stock, then we may be obligated to indemnify Orbital ATK for such taxes imposed on the combined company. We are permitted to take any of the actions described above only if we obtain an opinion\nof counsel that is reasonably acceptable to Orbital ATK (or an IRS private letter ruling) to the effect that the action will not affect the tax-free status of the Spin-Off, the Merger or certain related transactions. Such a ruling or opinion may not be obtainable, however. In addition, the receipt of any such opinion or IRS ruling in respect of an action we propose to take will not relieve us of any obligation it has to indemnify Orbital ATK if such action causes the Spin-Off, Merger or certain related transactions to be taxable to Orbital ATK.\nBecause of these restrictions, for two years after the Spin-Off, we may be limited in the amount of capital stock we can issue to make acquisitions or to raise additional capital. Also, our indemnity obligation to Orbital ATK may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control of Vista Outdoor during this two-year period in a transaction that stockholders of Vista Outdoor might consider favorable.\nSubstantial sales of our common stock may occur following the Spin-Off, which could increase volatility in our stock price or cause our stock price to decline.\nOrbital ATK stockholders who received shares of our common stock in the Spin-Off generally may sell those shares in the public market at any time. Although we have no actual knowledge of any plan or intention of any significant stockholder to sell our common stock following the Spin-Off, it is likely that some Orbital ATK stockholders, possibly including some of its larger stockholders, will sell their shares of our common stock received in the Spin-Off if, for reasons such as our business profile or market capitalization as an independent company, we do not fit their investment objectives, or, in the case of index funds, we are not a participant in the index in which they are investing. The sales of significant amounts of our common stock or the perception in the market that such sales may occur may decrease the market price of our common stock or increase its volatility.\nProvisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, our Amended and Restated Bylaws, the Tax Matters Agreement and Delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nSeveral provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated Bylaws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable. These include provisions that:\n\u2022 permit us to issue preferred stock;\n\u2022 forbid our stockholders to act by written consent and require that stockholder action must take place at a duly called annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022 establish how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at meetings of our stockholders;\n\u2022 divide our board of directors into three classes, with each class serving a staggered three-year term, which could have the effect of making the replacement of incumbent directors more time consuming and difficult;\n\u2022 mandate that stockholders may only remove directors for cause;\n\u2022 grant exclusive privilege (subject to certain limited exceptions) to our directors, and not our stockholders, to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022 provide that only our board of directors, Chairman of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer or the President (in the absence of the Chief Executive Officer) are entitled to call a special meeting of our stockholders; and\n\u2022 limit our ability to enter into business combination transactions with certain stockholders.\nThese and other provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated Bylaws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or a threatened acquisition or change in control of us, including unsolicited takeover attempts, even though the transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock at a price above the prevailing market price.", "PERMNO": 15168, "SIC": 3480, "TIC": "VSTO"}
