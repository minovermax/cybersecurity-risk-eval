You should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk factor contained below.\nMarket Conditions\n\uf0b7 COVID-19 has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our global business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and its ultimate impact will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be predicted.\n\uf0b7 Deterioration of economic conditions, geopolitical tensions, changes in market conditions or weakening in global capital markets may materially affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\n\uf0b7 Sustained low, declining or negative interest rates, or rapidly increasing interest rates, have materially and adversely affected and may continue to materially and adversely affect our profitability.\nReserves and Exposures\n\uf0b7 The amount and timing of insurance and reinsurance liability claims are difficult to predict and such claims may exceed the related liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses or future policy benefits, or the liabilities associated with certain guaranteed benefits and indexed features accounted for as embedded derivatives at fair value.\n\uf0b7 Reinsurance may be unavailable or too expensive relative to its benefit, and may not be adequate to protect us against losses.\n\uf0b7 Our consolidated results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and ratings are subject to the effects of natural and man-made catastrophic events.\n\uf0b7 Concentration of our insurance, reinsurance and other risk exposures may have adverse effects.\n\uf0b7 Following the Majority Interest Fortitude Sale (as defined in Part II, Item 7. - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Summary below), our largest reinsurance counterparty, Fortitude Re, is no longer controlled by us, and a failure by Fortitude Re to perform its obligations could have a material effect on our business, results of operations or liquidity and the accounting treatment of our reinsurance agreements with Fortitude Re could also lead to volatility in our net income.\n\uf0b7 Our subsidiaries may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) and record additional liabilities for future policy benefits due to interest rate fluctuations, increased lapses and surrenders, declining investment returns and other events.\n\uf0b7 Losses due to nonperformance or defaults by counterparties may materially and adversely affect the value of our investments, our profitability and sources of liquidity.\n\uf0b7 Climate change may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nInvestment Portfolio and Concentration of Investments\n\uf0b7 Our investment portfolio is concentrated in certain segments of the economy, and the performance and value of our investment portfolio are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in interest rates and credit spreads. In addition, a significant portion of our investment portfolio is now managed by Blackstone, which makes its performance and value subject to Blackstone\u2019s ability to successfully manage it.\n\uf0b7 Our valuation of investments and derivatives involves the application methodologies and assumptions to derive estimates, which may differ from actual experience and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity or lead to volatility in our net income.\nLiquidity, Capital and Credit\n\uf0b7 AIG Parent\u2019s ability to access funds from our subsidiaries is limited, and our sources of liquidity may be insufficient to meet our needs, including providing capital that may be required by our subsidiaries.\n\uf0b7 We may not be able to generate cash to meet our needs due to the illiquidity of some of our investments.\n24 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\n\uf0b7 A downgrade by one or more of the rating agencies in the Insurer Financial Strength ratings of our insurance or reinsurance companies could limit their ability to write or prevent them from writing new business and impair their retention of customers and in-force business, and a downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\n\uf0b7 Changes in the method for determining LIBOR and the continuing phase out of LIBOR and uncertainty related to LIBOR replacement rates may affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nBusiness and Operations\n\uf0b7 No assurances can be given that the separation of our Life and Retirement business will occur or as to the specific terms or timing thereof. In addition, the separation could cause the emergence or exacerbate the effects of other risks to which AIG is exposed.\n\uf0b7 Failure to effectively execute on AIG 200 could result in costs that are greater than expected, savings that are less than expected and disruption to our businesses that could have a material effect on our operations or financial condition.\n\uf0b7 Pricing for our products is subject to our ability to adequately assess risks and estimate related losses.\n\uf0b7 Guarantees within certain of our products may increase the volatility of our results.\n\uf0b7 Our foreign operations expose us to risks that may affect our operations.\n\uf0b7 Our restructuring initiatives may not yield our expected reductions in expenses and improvements in operational and organizational efficiency.\n\uf0b7 We may experience difficulty in marketing and distributing products through our current and future distribution channels and the use of third parties may result in additional liabilities.\n\uf0b7 We are exposed to certain risks if we are unable to maintain the availability of our critical technology systems and data and safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of our data, which could compromise our ability to conduct business and adversely affect our consolidated business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\n\uf0b7 Third parties we rely upon to provide certain business and administrative services on our behalf may not perform as anticipated, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\uf0b7 Business or asset acquisitions and dispositions may expose us to certain risks.\n\uf0b7 Significant legal or regulatory proceedings may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\n\uf0b7 Increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from investors, customers, regulators and other stakeholders regarding environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters may adversely affect our reputation or otherwise adversely impact our business and results of operations.\n\uf0b7 Our risk management policies and procedures may prove to be ineffective and leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nRegulation\n\uf0b7 Our businesses are heavily regulated and changes in laws and regulations may affect our operations, increase our insurance subsidiary capital requirements or reduce our profitability.\n\uf0b7 New laws and regulations or new interpretations of current laws and regulations, both domestically and internationally, may affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and ability to complete effectively.\n\uf0b7 Changes to tax laws could increase our corporate taxes or make some of our products less attractive to consumers.\nEstimates and Assumptions\n\uf0b7 Estimates or assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements and modeled results used in various areas of our business may differ materially from actual experience.\n\uf0b7 Changes in accounting principles and financial reporting requirements will impact our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\n\uf0b7 If our businesses do not perform well and/or their estimated fair values decline, we may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill or establish an additional valuation allowance against the deferred income tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nCompetition and Employees\n\uf0b7 We face intense competition in each of our business lines and technological changes may present new and intensified challenges to our business.\n\uf0b7 Competition for employees in our industry is intense, and managing key employee succession is critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain the key employees and highly skilled people we need to support our business.\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 25\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\nRisk Factors\nInvesting in AIG involves risk. In deciding whether to invest in AIG, you should carefully consider the following risk factors. Any of these risk factors could have a significant or material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. They could also cause significant fluctuations and volatility in the trading price of our securities. Readers should not consider any descriptions of these factors to be a complete set of all potential risks that could affect AIG. These factors should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and the other reports and materials filed by us with the SEC. Further, many of these risks are interrelated and could occur under similar business and economic conditions, and the occurrence of certain of them may in turn cause the emergence or exacerbate the effect of others. Such a combination could materially increase the severity of the impact of these risks on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity above and beyond a risk\u2019s singular impact.\nMARKET CONDITIONS\nCOVID-19 has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our global business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and its ultimate impact will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be predicted. The COVID-19 pandemic is still evolving, but it has caused significant societal disruption and has had adverse economic impacts on our business, such as volatility in the capital markets, disruptions in the labor market, supply chain disruption, mortality increases as compared to pricing expectations and most recently, an inflationary environment. We cannot estimate the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also cannot, at this time, estimate the full extent to which the pandemic has caused and may continue to cause certain risks to our global business, including those discussed herein, to be heightened or realized.\nAdverse changes and developments affecting the global economy, including the significant global economic downturn and increased volatility in financial and capital markets and credit spreads, individually and in the aggregate, have had and may continue to have negative effects on our overall investment portfolio. While, to date, the short-term economic impacts of COVID-19 have been largely offset by intervention taken by governments and monetary authorities, it remains difficult to quantify the potential long-term financial impacts on our investment portfolio. Further, in the event of a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, particularly due to the rise in cases associated with current and any future potential variants of COVID-19, there can be no assurance that governments and monetary authorities will continue to intervene in markets or provide for economic stimulus, and if they do, whether such intervention will be successful.\nWithin our investment portfolio, there is concentrated exposure to certain segments of the economy, including real estate and real estate-related investments, which exposes us to negative impacts from the deferral of mortgage payments, renegotiated commercial mortgage loans or outright mortgage defaults and potential acceleration of macro trends such as work from home and online shopping, as well as significant exposure to certain industries negatively impacted by the economic downturn, such as off-line retail, travel and transportation. Moreover, market volatility has created and may continue to create dislocations, decreases or variations in observable market activity or availability of information used in the valuation of our assets and liabilities, which could negatively impair the estimates and assumptions used to run our business or result in greater variability and subjectivity in our investment decisions.\nOur insurance businesses have experienced and may continue to experience increased claim volume under our Life and Retirement Insurance products, which are offered primarily in the United States, which has seen a high number of COVID-19 cases and deaths relative to other jurisdictions, and our General Insurance policies, which are offered both in the U.S. and internationally, including commercial property (business interruption), travel, trade credit, accident and health, workers\u2019 compensation, directors and officers, event cancellation and liability insurance. Beginning in March 2020, we experienced an increase in mortality claims, which we expect to continue until the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, and decreased demand for certain of our insurance product lines, such as travel insurance, and it is unclear when such demand will return. In addition, COVID-19 adversely affected our premiums and deposits in some of our insurance lines, including our Life and Retirement products. If the economic effects continue or increase in severity, or the economic recovery is prolonged, or if there are any future \u201csurges\u201d of variants, we expect the impacts described herein will continue in 2022 and possibly beyond. Further, our policies with premium adjustment features tied to exposure levels, as is the case in certain specialty and casualty lines, may be triggered, resulting in premium reductions. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting ongoing adverse, economic, financial and market impacts, we have made and may continue to make changes to underwriting guidelines or product design. We may also incur higher expenses in our insurance businesses and higher legal costs as a result of coverage disputes, including class actions and other proceedings that have been or may in the future be filed against us, our insureds, or others in the United States, the UK or other jurisdictions seeking coverage for COVID 19-related losses or alleging\n26 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\nbad-faith denials of coverage for such losses. The outcome of coverage decisions may in turn affect the perceived value of the products we offer and therefore the demand for them.\nWhile we seek to mitigate our loss exposure through reinsurance, the availability of reinsurance relief typically depends on several factors, including the timing and nature of how individual claims manifest, which may not be immediately known. Furthermore, due to the scope, severity and uncertain duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, reinsurance may not be available or, if available, may be more difficult or costly to obtain in general or for certain types of coverage, such as natural catastrophes, going forward. In addition, reinsurance terms and conditions may change whereby, even if reinsurance is available, the coverage provided may not be the same or similar to the reinsurance terms and conditions currently available in the reinsurance market.\nThe economic impacts of the pandemic have resulted and may continue to result in policyholders cancelling or not renewing insurance policies or may result in policyholders seeking sources of liquidity such as policy loans and withdrawals at rates greater than expected. If policyholder behavior, including lapse and surrender rates, significantly exceed or vary from our expectations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, requiring our subsidiaries to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and record additional liabilities for future policy benefits.\nGovernment officials have recommended or mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including prohibitions on congregating in heavily populated areas, social distancing requirements, stay-at-home orders and similar measures. As a result, we implemented work-from-home business continuity plans for non-essential staff globally. Where permitted by local laws and regulations, our offices are open to fully vaccinated employees with mask mandates, social distancing and office capacity limits, and we have strict quarantine and contact tracing protocols in place in the event a positive case occurs. These precautionary measures have also impacted our distribution organizations and wholesaler interactions with our clients across multiple channels where our business benefits from a high degree of customer interaction. Our results may be adversely impacted by these and other actions taken to contain or reduce the impact of COVID-19, and the extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Changes to our workforce as a result of COVID-19, including wage inflation, may also increase our costs and the risk of errors due to turnover, remote work and inexperience. Moreover, the extended remote work environment puts ongoing stress on our current business continuity plans and may prove them to be less effective than expected.\nAny future business continuity plans may not be sustainable or effective. Our business operations may also be significantly disrupted if our critical workforce, key vendors, third-party providers or other counterparties we transact business with, are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government and regulatory actions in response to COVID-19, including vaccine mandates, or other reasons, or if the technology on which our remote business operations rely, some of which is developed and maintained by third parties, is disrupted or impaired or becomes unavailable. Certain pre-existing operational risks have been and may continue to be exacerbated, notably with respect to potential phishing or other cybersecurity-related events and our increased reliance on technology, including technology of our employees and service providers. Other pre-existing operational risks, such as privacy incidents, fraud, operational resilience and risks related to the operations and resiliency of our vendors, third-party providers and other counterparties, may also be exacerbated. Further, significant disruption to our businesses due to the pandemic could adversely affect the timing or terms of, or our ability to execute, key business strategies, transactions and initiatives, such as the separation of the Life and Retirement business and AIG 200, resulting in higher costs or reduced savings or lower profit than was expected. In addition, remote work may negatively impact our culture and employees\u2019 morale, which could result in greater turnover, lower productivity and greater operational risks.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives and court decisions following major catastrophes (such as pandemics) could require us to pay insureds beyond the provisions of their original insurance policies and may prohibit the application of a deductible, resulting in inflated and unanticipated catastrophe claims; or impose other restrictions after the occurrence thereof, which would reduce our ability to mitigate exposure. For example, COVID-19 has given rise to regulatory measures intended to encourage or require insurers to assist policyholders adversely impacted by COVID-19 (in some cases with retroactive effect), including lapse, payment or rate increase moratoriums, premium refunds, contributions to relief funds and similar measures. While some of these legislative and regulatory initiatives have expired, with the resurgence of the COVID-19 virus, legislative and regulatory authorities have extended certain of these initiatives and may seek to renew or impose more of them until the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. These initiatives could impair our cash flows and, without regulatory relief, could reduce our subsidiaries\u2019 capital ratios. In addition, in certain jurisdictions, legislative initiatives have emerged requiring contributions to relief funds or legislation has been proposed that would require insurers to provide insurance coverage beyond the scope of the original contract by re-writing contracts on a retroactive basis, including with respect to the availability of business interruption coverage in commercial property policies, or creating insurance solutions prospectively. Such legislative and regulatory initiatives and proposals, if enacted, could result in requirements or restrictions that negatively impact our business operations or require us to pay beyond the provisions of original insurance policies and assumed reinsurance contracts. Finally, the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on Federal and state tax revenues could lead to increased taxes and assessments on insurers in order to address budget shortfalls.\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 27\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\nMoreover, as vaccinations have become readily available, certain organizations have imposed vaccine mandates on employees returning to the office and customers or clients accessing offices, stores and other spaces, and governments have imposed vaccine mandates on certain daily activities. It is currently not possible to predict with certainty the exact impact any such mandates would have on us. In addition, if the vaccines are not as effective as expected, including against new variants of COVID-19, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nDue to the evolving and disruptive nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, we could experience other potential impacts as a result of COVID-19, including, but not limited to, potential impairment charges to the carrying amounts of goodwill, deferred tax assets, increased reserves to levels that are difficult to accurately estimate and increased morbidity and mortality expectations from longer term consequences of COVID-19 infections. Further, new and potentially unforeseen risks beyond those described above and in other Risk Factors herein may arise as a result of the pandemic and the actions taken by governmental and regulatory authorities to mitigate its impact.\nSee also Reserves and Exposures - \u201cReinsurance may be unavailable or too expensive relative to its benefit, and may not be adequate to protect us against losses\u201d and \u201cOur consolidated results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and ratings are subject to the effects of natural and man-made catastrophic events\u201d below.\nDeterioration of economic conditions, geopolitical tensions, changes in market conditions or weakening in global capital markets may materially affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Our businesses are highly dependent on global economic and market conditions. Weaknesses in economic conditions and the capital markets or market volatility have in the past led, and may in the future lead to, among other consequences, a poor operating environment, erosion of consumer and investor confidence, reduced business volumes, deteriorating liquidity, declines in asset valuations and impacts on policyholder behavior that could influence reserve valuations. Key ways in which we have in the past been, and could in the future be, negatively affected by economic conditions include, but are not limited to: increases in policy withdrawals, surrenders and cancellations; write-offs of deferred policy acquisition costs; increases in liability for future policy benefits due to loss recognition on certain long-duration insurance and reinsurance contracts; reduced demand for products and services; increases in expenses associated with third-party reinsurance, or decreased ability to obtain reinsurance at acceptable terms; and increased likelihood of, or increased magnitude of, asset impairments caused by market fluctuations.\nAdverse economic conditions may result from global economic and political developments, including plateauing business activity and inflationary pressures in developed economies, including the United States, civil unrest, geopolitical tensions, foreign investment restrictions, or military action and new or evolving legal and regulatory requirements on business investment, hiring, migration, labor supply and global supply chains. These and other market, economic, and political factors have and could continue to have an adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity in many ways, including (i) lower levels of consumer and commercial business activities that have decreased and may continue to decrease revenues and profitability and thus impair goodwill, deferred tax assets or other long-term assets, (ii) widening of credit spreads and higher than expected defaults that could reduce investment asset valuations, increase credit losses across numerous asset classes, and increase statutory capital requirements, (iii) increased market volatility and uncertainty that could decrease liquidity, increase borrowing costs and limit access to capital markets, (iv) the reduction of investment income generated by our investment portfolio, (v) disruption to our business operations in countries experiencing geopolitical tensions as well as increased costs associated with meeting customer needs in such regions, and (vi) impeding our ability to execute strategic transactions.\nFor information regarding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy, see Market Conditions - \u201cCOVID-19 has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our global business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and its ultimate impact will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be predicted\u201d above.\nSustained low, declining or negative interest rates, or rapidly increasing interest rates, have materially and adversely affected and may continue to materially and adversely affect our profitability. Global interest rates have been at or near historic lows, even after an increase in interest rates during 2021. Changes in interest rates may be correlated with inflation trends, which would impact our loss trends. Sustained low interest rates have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect the performance of our investments and reduce the level of investment income earned on our investment portfolios. We experience lower investment income as well as lower sales of new Life and Retirement insurance products and policies when a low or declining U.S. interest rate environment persists, and/or interest rates turn or, in certain circumstances remain negative across various global economies. For example, the current low interest rate environment has negatively affected sales of interest rate sensitive products in our industry and negatively impacted the profitability of our existing business as we reinvest cash flows from investments, including due to increased calls and prepayments of fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, at rates below the average yield of our existing portfolios. Due to practical and capital markets limitations, we have not been and may not be able to fully mitigate our interest rate risk by matching exposure of our assets relative to our liabilities. Continued low levels of interest rates have and could continue to impair our ability to earn the returns assumed in the pricing and the reserving for our products at the time they were sold and issued.\n28 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\nIn addition, fluctuations in interest rates may expose us to the risk of increases in certain statutory reserve requirements that are based on formulas or models that consider interest rates, which would reduce statutory capital, and increases in capital requirements and the amount of assets we must maintain to support statutory reserves, which would reduce surplus.\nOn the other hand, in periods of rapidly increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace, in a timely manner, the investments in our general account with higher yielding investments needed to keep interest rate sensitive products competitive. Therefore, we may have to accept a lower investment spread and, thus, lower profitability, or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. In addition, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals tend to increase as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns as interest rates rise. These impacts may result in significant cash outflows requiring that we sell investments at a time when the prices of those investments are adversely affected by the increase in interest rates, which could result in realized investment losses. An increase in interest rates could also have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the estimated fair values of the fixed income securities that constitute a substantial portion of our investment portfolio. This in turn could adversely affect our ability to realize our deferred tax assets.\nReserves and Exposures\nThe amount and timing of insurance and reinsurance liability claims are difficult to predict and such claims may exceed the related liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses or future policy benefits, or the liabilities associated with certain guaranteed benefits and indexed features accounted for as embedded derivatives at fair value. We regularly review the adequacy of the established liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and future policy benefits, as well as liabilities associated with certain guaranteed benefits and indexed features accounted for as embedded derivatives at fair value. We also conduct extensive analyses of our reserves and embedded derivatives during the year. Our liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, future policy benefits and embedded derivatives, however, may develop adversely and materially impact our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nFor General Insurance, estimation of ultimate net losses, loss expenses and the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a complex process, particularly for both long-tail and medium-tail liability lines of business. These lines include, but are not limited to, excess casualty, workers\u2019 compensation, general liability, commercial automobile liability, environmental and crisis management coverages, Financial Lines, insurance and risk management programs for large corporate customers and other customized structured insurance products, as well as excess and umbrella liability, errors and omissions, products liability, programs and specialty. There is also greater uncertainty in establishing reserves with respect to new business, particularly new business involving recently introduced product lines. In these cases, there is less historical experience or knowledge and less data upon which the actuaries can rely. Estimating reserves is further complicated by unexpected claims or unintended coverages that emerge due to unexpected events, such as COVID-19. These emerging issues may increase the size or number of claims beyond our underwriting intent and may not become apparent for many years after a policy is issued.\nWhile we use a number of analytical reserve development techniques to project future loss development, the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses has been and may continue to be significantly affected by changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors that were relied upon in setting the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. These changes in loss cost trends or loss development factors could be due to changes in actual versus expected claims and losses, difficulties in predicting changes, such as changes in inflation, unemployment, or other social or economic factors affecting claims, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, judicial and legislative actions, and changes in the tort environment. Any deviation in loss cost trends or in loss development factors might not be identified for an extended period of time after we record the initial loss reserve estimates for any accident year or number of years.\nFor Life and Retirement, establishment and ongoing calculations of future policy benefits and related reinsurance assets is a complex process, with significant judgmental inputs, assumptions and modeling techniques. The inputs and assumptions used in connection with calculations of reserves for future policy benefits are inherently uncertain. Experience may develop adversely such that additional reserves must be established or the value of embedded derivatives may increase. Adverse experience could arise out of a number of factors, including, but not limited to, severe short-term events, such as a pandemic or changes to policyholder behavior during stressed economic periods, or due to misestimation of long-term assumptions such as mortality, interest rates, credit spreads, equity market levels and volatility and persistency assumptions. Certain variables, such as policyholder behavior, are difficult to estimate and can have a significant impact on reserves and embedded derivatives. Life and Retirement reviews and updates actuarial assumptions at least annually, typically in the third quarter for reserves and embedded derivatives. Additionally, Life and Retirement regularly carries out loss recognition testing for GAAP reporting and cash flow testing for statutory reporting.\nFor additional information on reserve development, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A - Insurance Reserves.\nFor additional information on our loss reserves, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates - Loss Reserves and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 29\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\nFor additional information regarding these products, see Notes 4 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 1. Business - Regulation, and Part II, Item 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates - Liabilities for Guaranteed Benefit Features of Variable Annuity, Fixed Annuity and Fixed Index Annuity Products.\nReinsurance may be unavailable or too expensive relative to its benefit, and may not be adequate to protect us against losses. Our subsidiaries are major purchasers of third-party reinsurance and we use reinsurance as part of our overall risk management strategy. Our reinsurance business also purchases retrocessional reinsurance, which allows a reinsurer to cede to another company all or part of the reinsurance obligations originally assumed by the reinsurer. While reinsurance does not discharge our subsidiaries from their obligation to pay claims for losses insured or reinsured under our policies, it does make the reinsurer liable to the subsidiaries for the reinsured portion of the risk. For this reason, reinsurance is an important tool to manage transaction and insurance line risk retention and to mitigate losses, including as a result of catastrophes. Market conditions beyond our control may impact the availability and cost of reinsurance or retrocessional reinsurance and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, reinsurance is typically more difficult or costly to obtain after a year or consecutive years with a large number of major catastrophes. We may, at certain times, be forced to incur additional costs for reinsurance or may be unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance on acceptable terms. In the latter case, we would have to accept an increase in exposure to risk, reduce the amount of business written by our subsidiaries or seek alternatives in line with our risk limits, or a combination thereof.\nAdditionally, we are exposed to credit risk with respect to our subsidiaries\u2019 reinsurers to the extent the reinsurance receivable is not secured, or is inadequately secured, by collateral or does not benefit from other credit enhancements. We also bear the risk that a reinsurer is, or may be, unwilling to pay amounts we have recorded as reinsurance recoverables for any reason, including that (i) the terms of the reinsurance contract do not reflect the intent of the parties to the contract or there is a disagreement between the parties as to their intent, or (ii) the terms of the contract cannot be legally enforced. We also bear the risk that (i) the terms of the contract are interpreted by a court or arbitration panel differently than expected, (ii) the reinsurance transaction performs differently than we anticipated compared to the original structure, terms or conditions, or (iii) a change in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation of the laws and regulations, materially impacts a reinsurance transaction. The insolvency of one or more of our reinsurers, the inability or unwillingness of such reinsurers to make timely payments under the terms of our contracts or payments in an amount equal to our reinsurance recoverable, or the risk that the reinsurance transaction does not operate as intended, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity.\nAdditionally, the use of reinsurance placed in the capital markets may not provide the same levels of protection as traditional reinsurance transactions. Any disruption, volatility and uncertainty in these markets, such as following a major catastrophic event, may limit our ability to access such markets on terms favorable to us or at all. Also, to the extent that we intend to use structures based on an industry loss index or other non-indemnity trigger rather than on actual losses incurred by us, we could be subject to residual risk.\nOur Life and Retirement companies also utilize intercompany reinsurance arrangements to provide capital benefits to their affiliated cedants. They have also begun and may continue to pursue reinsurance transactions and permitted practices to manage the capital impact of statutory reserve requirements under applicable reserving rules, including principle-based reserving (PBR). The application of actuarial guidelines and PBR involves numerous interpretations. If state insurance departments do not agree with our interpretations or if regulations change with respect to our ability to manage the capital impact of certain statutory reserve requirements, the statutory reserve requirements of our Life and Retirement companies could increase, or the ability of our Life and Retirement companies to take reserve credit for reinsurance transactions could be reduced or eliminated. Additionally, if the ratings of our Life and Retirement companies decline, we could incur higher costs to obtain reinsurance, each of which could adversely affect sales of our products and our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe currently have limited catastrophe reinsurance coverage for terrorist attacks. Further, the availability of private sector reinsurance for terrorism is limited. We benefit from the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (TRIPRA), which provides U.S. government risk assistance to the insurance industry to manage the exposure to terrorism incidents in the U.S. TRIPRA was reauthorized in December 2019 for a further seven years. Under TRIPRA, once our losses for certain acts of terrorism exceed a deductible equal to 20 percent of our direct commercial property and casualty insurance premiums for covered lines for the prior calendar year, the federal government will reimburse us for 80 percent of losses in excess of our deductible, up to a total industry program limit of $100 billion. TRIPRA does not cover losses in certain lines of business such as personal property and personal casualty. We also rely on the government sponsored and government arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nFor additional information on our reinsurance recoverable, see Part II, Item 7.

Events such as hurricanes, windstorms, hailstorms, flooding, earthquakes, wildfires, solar storms, war or other military action, acts of terrorism, explosions and fires, cyber-crimes, product defects, pandemics and other highly contagious diseases, mass torts, civil unrest and other catastrophes have adversely affected our business in the past and could do so in the future. For example, we incurred pre-tax catastrophe losses of $1.4 billion in 2021, which included losses in our General Insurance business from flooding and rainstorms, windstorms and hailstorms and winter storms, and pre-tax catastrophe losses of $2.4 billion in 2020, which included losses in our General Insurance business from the COVID-19 pandemic, windstorms and hailstorms, hurricanes, wildfires and civil unrest.\nCatastrophic events, and any relevant regulations, could result in losses in any business in which we operate, and could expose us to:\n\uf0b7 widespread claim costs associated with property, workers\u2019 compensation, accident and health, travel, business interruption and mortality and morbidity claims;\n\uf0b7 loss resulting from a decline in the value of our invested assets;\n\uf0b7 limitations on our ability to recover deferred tax assets;\n\uf0b7 loss resulting from actual policy experience that is adverse compared to the assumptions made in product pricing;\n\uf0b7 revenue loss due to decline in customer base;\n\uf0b7 declines in value and/or losses with respect to companies and other entities whose securities we hold and counterparties we transact business with and have credit exposure to, including reinsurers; and\n\uf0b7 significant disruptions to our physical infrastructure, systems and operations.\nNatural and man-made catastrophic events are generally unpredictable. Our exposure to catastrophe-related loss depends on various factors, including the frequency and severity of the catastrophes, the availability of reinsurance, the rate of inflation and the value and geographic or other concentrations of insured companies and individuals. Vendor models and proprietary assumptions and processes that we use to manage catastrophe exposure may prove to be ineffective due to incorrect assumptions or estimates. For example, modeling for terrorism, cyber events and pandemics is more difficult and may be less reliable.\nIn addition, legislative and regulatory initiatives and court decisions following major catastrophes (both natural and man-made) could require us to pay the insured beyond the provisions of the original insurance policy and may prohibit the application of a deductible, resulting in inflated and unanticipated claims; or impose other restrictions after the occurrence of a major catastrophe, which would reduce our ability to mitigate exposure.\nFor additional information on potential catastrophic events, including a sensitivity analysis of our exposure to certain catastrophes, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A - Enterprise Risk Management - Insurance Risks.\nFor information regarding the effects of climate change on our business, see Reserves and Exposures - \u201cClimate change may adversely affect our business and financial condition\u201d below.\nFor information regarding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, see Market Conditions - \u201cCOVID-19 has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our global business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and its ultimate impact will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be predicted\u201d above.\nConcentration of our insurance, reinsurance and other risk exposures may have adverse effects. We are exposed to risks as a result of concentrations in our insurance and reinsurance policies, investments, derivatives and other obligations that we undertake for customers and counterparties. We manage these risks related to concentration by monitoring the accumulation of our exposures to factors such as exposure type and size, industry, geographic region, counterparty and other factors. We also seek to use third-party reinsurance, hedging and other arrangements to limit or offset exposures that exceed our retention and risk appetite limits. In certain circumstances, however, these risk management arrangements may not be available on acceptable terms or may prove to be ineffective. Our risk exposures under insurance and reinsurance policies, derivatives and other obligations are, from time to time, compounded by risk exposure assumed in our investment business. Also, our exposure for certain single risk coverages and other\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 31\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\ncoverages may be so large that adverse experience compared to our expectations may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or result in additional statutory capital requirements for our subsidiaries.\nIn addition, the separation of our Life and Retirement business, if completed, could increase the materiality of these potential concentrations in the remaining portfolio. For additional information on risks associated with the separation of the Life and Retirement business from AIG, see Business Operations - \u201cNo assurances can be given that the separation of our Life and Retirement business will occur or as to the specific terms or timing thereof. In addition, the separation could cause the emergence or exacerbate the effects of other risks to which AIG is exposed\u201d below.\nAlso see Part II, Item 7. MD&A - Business Segment Operations - General Insurance - Business Strategy and - Outlook - Industry and Economic Factors, and Part II, Item 7. MD&A - Business Segment Operations - Life and Retirement - Business Strategy and - Outlook - Industry and Economic Factors.\nFollowing the Majority Interest Fortitude Sale, our largest reinsurance counterparty, Fortitude Re, is no longer controlled by us, and a failure by Fortitude Re to perform its obligations could have a material effect on our business, results of operations or liquidity and the accounting treatment of our reinsurance agreements with Fortitude Re could also lead to volatility in our net income. As of June 2, 2020, we completed the Majority Interest Fortitude Sale (as defined in Item 7. Executive Summary - Sale of Fortitude Holdings), upon which Fortitude Group Holdings, LLC (Fortitude Holdings), the parent of Fortitude Re, became controlled 71.5% by affiliates of The Carlyle Group Inc. and 25% by affiliates of T&D Holdings, Inc., and our ownership interest in Fortitude Holdings was reduced to 3.5%. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $29.6 billion of reserves from AIG\u2019s Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines and approximately $3.8 billion of reserves from AIG\u2019s General Insurance Run-Off Lines, related to business written by multiple wholly-owned AIG subsidiaries, had been ceded to Fortitude Re under these reinsurance transactions. These reserve balances are fully collateralized pursuant to the terms of the reinsurance agreements. While we retained a seat on the board of managers of Fortitude Holdings, our ability to influence its operations going forward will be very limited. Our subsidiaries continue to remain primarily liable to policyholders under the business reinsured by Fortitude Re. As a result, if Fortitude Re is unable to successfully operate independently, or other issues arise that affect its financial condition or ability to satisfy or perform its obligations to our subsidiaries under the various reinsurance arrangements in force between Fortitude Re and such subsidiaries, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity to the extent the amount of collateral posted in respect of our reinsurance receivable is inadequate. Further, as is customary in similar reinsurance agreements, upon the occurrence of certain termination and recapture triggers on the part of Fortitude Re under the applicable reinsurance agreements, our subsidiaries may elect or may be required, to recapture the business ceded under such reinsurance agreements, which would result in a substantial increase to our net insurance liabilities and an increase in our solvency capital requirements. These termination and recapture triggers are standard termination and recapture events and include Fortitude Re becoming insolvent or being placed into liquidation, rehabilitation, conservatorship, supervision, receivership, bankruptcy or similar proceedings, certain regulatory ratios falling below certain thresholds, in the case of those reinsurance agreements made with Life and Retirement, Fortitude Re\u2019s failure to perform under the reinsurance agreements, or its entry into certain transactions without receiving our consent. Additionally, beginning in June 2023, Fortitude Re will have certain rights to replace AIG Asset Management (U.S.), LLC (AMG) as investment manager with respect to the assets supporting the reinsurance and to direct our subsidiaries to appoint a replacement investment manager with respect to those assets, if such appointment is reasonably acceptable to our subsidiaries and subject to the satisfaction of certain other conditions. If Fortitude Re were to so direct our subsidiaries to appoint another investment manager to replace AMG as investment manager with respect to the assets supporting the reinsurance, it could disrupt our internal investment advisory capabilities and cause a reduction in management fees received by AMG, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurthermore, the reinsurance transactions between AIG and Fortitude Re are structured as modified coinsurance (modco) for the Life and Retirement Run-Off Lines and loss portfolio transfer arrangements with funds withheld for the General Insurance Run-Off Lines. In modco and funds withheld arrangements, the investments supporting the reinsurance agreements, and which reflect the majority of the consideration that would be paid to the reinsurer for entering into the transaction, are withheld by, and therefore continue to reside on the balance sheet of, the ceding company (i.e., AIG and its subsidiaries) thereby creating an obligation for the ceding company to pay the reinsurer (i.e., Fortitude Re) at a later date. Additionally, as AIG maintains ownership of these investments, AIG will maintain its existing accounting for these assets (e.g., the changes in fair value of available for sale securities will be recognized within other comprehensive income). As a result of the deconsolidation resulting from the Majority Interest Fortitude Sale, AIG has established a funds withheld payable to Fortitude Re while simultaneously establishing a reinsurance asset representing reserves for the insurance coverage that Fortitude Re has assumed. The funds withheld payable contains an embedded derivative and changes in fair value of the embedded derivative related to the funds withheld payable are recognized in earnings through realized gains (losses). This embedded derivative is considered a total return swap with contractual returns that are attributable to various assets and liabilities associated with these reinsurance agreements. The manner in which we account for these various reinsurance agreements has and will continue to lead to volatility in our GAAP net income.\n32 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\nFor additional information on the sale of Fortitude Holdings see Part II, Item 7. MD&A - Consolidated Results of Operations.\nFor additional information on our exposure to credit risk of reinsurers, see Reserves and Exposures - \u201cReinsurance may be unavailable or too expensive relative to its benefit, and may not be adequate to protect us against losses\u201d above.\nOur subsidiaries may be required to accelerate the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC) and record additional liabilities for future policy benefits due to interest rate fluctuations, increased lapses and surrenders, declining investment returns and other events. We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. DAC represents deferred costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new business or renewal of existing business. The recovery of these costs is generally dependent upon the future profitability of the related business, but DAC amortization varies based on the type of contract. For long-duration traditional business, DAC is generally amortized in proportion to premium revenue and varies with lapse experience. Actual lapses in excess of expectations can result in an acceleration of DAC amortization, and therefore, adversely impact our pre-tax income.\nDAC for investment-oriented products is generally amortized in proportion to actual and estimated gross profits. Estimated gross profits are affected by a number of factors, including levels of current and expected interest rates, net investment income and credit spreads, net realized gains and losses, fees, surrender rates, mortality experience, policyholder behavior experience and equity market returns and volatility. If actual and/or future estimated gross profits are less than originally expected, then the amortization of these costs would be accelerated in the period this is determined and would result in a charge to income. For example, if interest rates rise rapidly and significantly, customers with policies that have interest crediting rates below the current market may seek competing products with higher returns and we may experience an increase in surrenders and withdrawals of life and annuity contracts, and thereby a strain on cash flow. Additionally, this would also result in a decrease in expected future profitability and an acceleration of the amortization of DAC, and therefore lower than expected pre-tax income earned during the then current period.\nWe also periodically review products for potential loss recognition events, principally insurance-oriented products. This review involves estimating the future profitability of in-force business and requires significant management judgment about assumptions including, but not limited to, mortality, morbidity, persistency, maintenance expenses and investment returns, including net realized gains (losses). If actual experience or revised future expectations result in projected future losses, we may be required to amortize any remaining DAC and record additional liabilities through a charge to policyholder benefits and losses occurred in the then current period, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nFor additional information on DAC and future policy benefits, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates and Notes 8 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor additional information on changes to accounting standards for long-duration insurance contracts, see Estimates and Assumptions - \u201cChanges in accounting principles and financial reporting requirements will impact our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\u201d\nLosses due to nonperformance or defaults by counterparties may materially and adversely affect the value of our investments, our profitability and sources of liquidity. We are exposed to credit risk arising from exposures to various counterparties related to investments, derivatives, premiums receivable, certain General Insurance businesses and reinsurance recoverables. These counterparties include, but are not limited to, issuers of fixed income and equity securities we hold, borrowers of loans we hold, customers, plan sponsors, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivatives instruments, reinsurers, corporate and governmental entities whose payments or performance we insure, joint venture partners, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses, custodians, brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, intra-group counterparties with respect to derivatives and other third parties, financial intermediaries and institutions and guarantors. These counterparties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, financial distress, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operational failure, fraud, government intervention and other reasons. In addition, for exchange-traded derivatives, such as futures, options as well as \"cleared\" over-the-counter derivatives, we are generally exposed to the credit risk of the relevant central counterparty clearing house and futures commission merchants through which we clear derivatives. Defaults by these counterparties on their obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on the value of our investments, business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nAn insolvency of, or the appointment of a receiver to rehabilitate or liquidate, a significant competitor could negatively impact our business if such appointment were to impact consumer confidence in our products and services. Additionally, if the underlying assets supporting the structured securities we invest in are expected to default or actually default on their payment obligations, our securities may incur losses.\nIn addition, our exposure to credit risk may be exacerbated in periods of market or credit stress, as derivative counterparties take a more conservative view of their acceptable credit exposure to us, resulting in reduced capacity to execute derivative-based hedges.\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 33\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\nClimate change may adversely affect our business and financial condition. AIG supports the scientific consensus that climate change is a reality of increasing global concern. Climate change, indicated by higher concentrations of greenhouse gases, a warming atmosphere and ocean, wildfires, diminished snow and ice, and a rise in sea levels, appears to have contributed to an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters and the creation of uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. As such, climate change presents significant financial implications for the insurance industry in areas such as underwriting, claims and investments, as well as risk capacity, financial reserving and operations.\nClimate change presents challenges to our ability to effectively underwrite, model and price catastrophe risk particularly if the frequency and severity of catastrophic events such as pandemics, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, wildfires and windstorms and other natural disasters continue to increase. For example, losses resulting from actual policy experience may be adverse as compared to the assumptions made in product pricing as well as mortality assumptions and our ability to mitigate our exposure may be reduced.\nClimate change-related risks may also adversely impact the value of the securities that we hold or lead to credit risk of other counterparties we transact business with, including reinsurers. Our reputation or corporate brand could also be negatively impacted as a result of changing customer or societal perceptions of organizations that we either insure or invest in due to their actions (or lack thereof) with respect to climate change. Any policies adopted by investors to address changing societal perceptions on climate change, could result in increased compliance cost to our businesses and changes to our corporate governance and risk management practices, and may affect the type of assets we hold in our investment portfolio.\nIn addition, regulators have imposed and may continue to impose new requirements or issue new guidance aimed at addressing or mitigating climate change-related risks. For example, on November 15, 2021, the NYDFS issued final guidance on how New York insurers are expected to analyze and manage the risks posed by climate change, including by integrating the consideration of climate risks into the insurer\u2019s governance structure, considering the current and forward-looking impact of climate-related factors on the insurer\u2019s business environment and incorporating climate risks into the insurer\u2019s existing financial risk management. The NYDFS expects New York insurers to implement its guidance relating to board governance and to have specific plans in place to implement the guidance relating to organizational structure by August 15, 2022. Additional actions by foreign governments, regulators and international standard setters could result in substantial additional regulation to which we may be subject. It is also possible that the laws and regulations adopted in foreign jurisdictions regarding climate change-related risks will differ from one another, and that they could be inconsistent with the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions in which we operate, including the United States.\nAdditionally, litigation related to climate change has increased in recent years. Many lawsuits center on enforcement or interpretation of environmental laws and regulations, often seeking to use litigation as a tool to influence governmental and corporate climate policies. Other cases seek damages for contribution to climate change or for insufficient disclosure around material financial risks. Increased litigation of this nature could trigger losses under liability policies, such as directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance policies, increase our liabilities and affect the viability of certain of our business lines.\nIn addition, severe weather and other effects of climate change result in more frequent and more severe damages, leading to lawsuits. Wildfires in the western U.S., resulting in significant litigation liability for utility companies, are an example of this. Indirect climate change effects are also seen in litigation over flooding, mudslides and other severe weather that results in injury or damage, as well as in construction defect litigation, chemical release lawsuits, and workers\u2019 compensation claims. Litigation related to climate change may, through increased claims from our customers and adverse impacts to the value of the securities that we hold adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe also have faced and may continue to face business continuity risk as a result of climate change-related incidents that may disrupt business operations, including extreme weather events. We cannot predict the long-term impacts of climate change on our business and results of operations.\nFor information regarding risks associated with other catastrophic events, see Reserves and Exposures - \u201cOur consolidated results of operations, liquidity, financial condition and ratings are subject to the effects of natural and man-made catastrophic events\u201d above.\nINVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND CONCENTRATION OF INVESTMENTS\nOur investment portfolio is concentrated in certain segments of the economy, and the performance and value of our investment portfolio are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in interest rates and credit spreads. In addition, a significant portion of our investment portfolio is now managed by Blackstone, which makes its performance and value subject to Blackstone\u2019s ability to successfully manage it. Our results of operations and financial condition have in the past been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by the degree of concentration in our investment portfolio. For example, we have significant holdings of real estate and real estate-related investments, including residential mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and residential and commercial mortgage loans. We also have significant exposures to financial institutions and, in particular, to money center banks and global banks, certain industries, such as energy and utilities, the U.S. federal, state and local government issuers and authorities, and global financial institutions,\n34 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\ngovernments and corporations. Events or developments that have a negative effect on any particular industry, asset class, group of related industries or geographic region may adversely affect the valuation of our investments to the extent they are concentrated in such segments. Our ability to sell assets in such segments may be limited.\nOur investments are also subject to market risks and uncertainties, including, in addition to interest rate risk, changes in the level of credit spreads, currency rates, and commodity and equity prices, each of which has affected and will continue to affect the value of investments in our investment portfolio as well as the performance of, and returns generated by, such investments. The discontinuation of actions taken by legislators and monetary authorities in advance of substantial economic recovery could adversely impact the performance of our investment portfolio. For information regarding risks associated with interest rate volatility, see Market Conditions - \u201cSustained low, declining or negative interest rates, or rapidly increasing interest rates, have materially and adversely affected and may continue to materially and adversely affect our profitability\u201d above.\nFurthermore, our alternative investment portfolio, which is subject to volatility in equity markets, includes investments for which changes in fair value are reported through pre-tax income. An economic downturn or decline in the capital markets may have a material adverse effect on our investment income, including as a result of decreases in the fair value of alternative investments.\nIn addition, in connection with its acquisition of a 9.9 percent equity stake in SAFG Retirement Services, Inc. (SAFG), AIG entered into a long-term asset management relationship with Blackstone, pursuant to which Blackstone is managing an initial $50 billion of Life and Retirement\u2019s existing investment portfolio, with that amount increasing by increments of $8.5 billion per year for the next five years beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022, for an aggregate of $92.5 billion. As part of this arrangement, Blackstone is serving as the exclusive external investment manager for certain asset classes, which is expected to lead to an increase in investment management fees payable by us as compared to expenses we have historically incurred for similar services. Also, the exclusivity provisions and termination provisions may prevent our subsidiaries from retaining other external investment managers with respect to the subject asset classes who may produce better returns on investments than Blackstone. Furthermore, Blackstone\u2019s ability to allocate and invest our assets across a range of suitable investment opportunities may be limited in certain circumstances due to compliance with the asset management agreements (including the investment and allocation guidelines thereunder). If Blackstone is unable to effectively manage our portfolio, the concentration of assets in our portfolio that are managed by Blackstone could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nOur valuation of investments and derivatives involves the application of methodologies and assumptions to derive estimates, which may differ from actual experience and could result in changes to investment valuations that may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity or lead to volatility in our net income. During periods of market disruption, it has been and may continue to be difficult to value certain of our investments or derivatives if trading becomes less frequent and/or market data becomes less observable. There may be cases where certain assets in normally active markets with significant observable data become inactive with insufficient observable data due to the financial environment or market conditions in effect at that time. As a result, valuations may include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation and judgment as well as valuation methods that are more complex. These values may not be realized in a market transaction, may not reflect the value of the asset and may change very rapidly as market conditions change and valuation assumptions are modified. Decreases in value and/or an inability to realize that value in a market transaction or other disposition may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nFor information regarding volatility in accounting as it relates to Fortitude Re, see Reserves and Exposures - \u201cFollowing the Majority Interest Fortitude Sale, our largest reinsurance counterparty, Fortitude Re, is no longer controlled by us, and a failure by Fortitude Re to perform its obligations could have a material effect on our business, results of operations or liquidity and the accounting treatment of our reinsurance agreements with Fortitude Re could also lead to volatility in our net income\u201d above.\nLIQUIDITY, CAPITAL AND CREDIT\nAIG Parent\u2019s ability to access funds from our subsidiaries is limited, and our sources of liquidity may be insufficient to meet our needs, including providing capital that may be required by our subsidiaries. As a holding company, AIG Parent depends on dividends, distributions and other payments from its subsidiaries to fund dividends on AIG Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock, to fund repurchases of AIG Common Stock and debt obligations and to make payments due on its obligations, including its outstanding debt and tax obligations. The majority of our investments are held by our regulated subsidiaries. Any inability by our subsidiaries to make payments, dividends or other distributions in an amount sufficient to enable AIG Parent to meet its cash requirements could have an adverse effect on our operations, and on our ability to pay dividends, repurchase AIG Common Stock and debt obligations, meet our debt service obligations, pay our operating expenses and meet capital and liquidity needs of our other subsidiaries.\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 35\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\nThe ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or other distributions to us in the future will depend on their earnings, tax considerations, covenants contained in any financing or other agreements, applicable regulatory restrictions and rating agency requirements. In addition, such payments could be limited as a result of claims against our subsidiaries by their creditors, including suppliers, vendors, lessors and employees. In addition, our insurance subsidiaries are limited in their ability to make dividend payments or other distributions to AIG Parent in the future because of the need to support their own capital levels or because of regulatory limits and restrictions. Such restrictions are based in part on the prior year\u2019s statutory income, capital and surplus, and unassigned funds (surplus) and require our insurance subsidiaries to hold a specific amount of minimum reserves in order to meet future obligations on their outstanding policies. Changes in, or reinterpretations of, these regulatory standards could constrain the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our debt obligations and corporate expenses.\nOur decision to pursue strategic changes or transactions in our business and operations may also subject our subsidiaries\u2019 dividend plans to heightened regulatory scrutiny and could make obtaining regulatory approvals for extraordinary distributions by our subsidiaries, if required, more difficult. We are also subject to certain other restrictions on our capital from time to time.\nCertain of our subsidiaries, for example, need sufficient liquidity in order to maintain regulatory capital ratios, comply with rating agency requirements, meet unexpected cash flow obligations, satisfy capital maintenance and guarantee agreements and collateralize debt. If our liquidity is insufficient to meet our needs, we may need to have recourse to third-party financing, external capital markets or other sources of liquidity, which may not be available or could be expensive. The availability and cost of any additional financing at any given time depends on a variety of factors, including general market conditions, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit, regulatory actions and our credit ratings and credit capacity. It is also possible that, as a result of such recourse to external financing, customers, lenders or investors could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects. Disruptions, volatility and uncertainty in the financial markets, and downgrades in our financial strength or credit ratings, may limit our ability to access external capital markets at times and on terms favorable to us to meet our capital and liquidity needs or restrict our access to the external capital markets or other financing sources. If AIG Parent is unable to satisfy a capital need of a subsidiary, the credit rating agencies could downgrade the subsidiary\u2019s financial strength ratings or the subsidiary could become insolvent or, in certain cases, could be seized by its regulator.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we are required to post collateral for our insurance company subsidiaries from time to time. If our reinsurance liabilities increase, we may be required to post additional collateral for insurance company clients that we reinsure. In addition, we may be required to post additional collateral due to regulatory changes from time to time. The need to post this additional collateral, if significant enough, may require us to sell investments at a loss in order to provide securities of suitable credit quality or otherwise secure adequate capital at an unattractive cost. This could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFor additional information on our liquidity, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\nFor additional information on rating agency requirements, see Liquidity, Capital and Credit - \u201cA downgrade by one or more of the rating agencies in the Insurer Financial Strength ratings of our insurance or reinsurance companies could limit their ability to write or prevent them from writing new business and impair their retention of customers and in-force business, and a downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity\u201d below.\nWe may not be able to generate cash to meet our needs due to the illiquidity of some of our investments. We and our subsidiaries have a diversified investment portfolio. However, economic conditions as well as adverse capital market conditions, including a lack of buyers, the inability of potential buyers to obtain financing on reasonable terms, volatility, credit spread changes, interest rate changes, foreign currency exchange rates and/or declines in collateral values have in the past impacted, and may in the future impact, the liquidity and value of our investments.\nWe have investments in certain securities, including certain fixed income structured and privately placed securities as well as investments in private equity funds and hedge funds, mortgage loans, finance receivables and real estate that are less liquid than other types of securities. Collectively, investments in these assets had a carrying value of $62 billion at December 31, 2021. If it became necessary to sell such assets in a stressed market environment, the prices achieved in any sale of such securities may be lower than their carrying value, which could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Adverse changes in the valuation of real estate and real estate-linked assets, deterioration of capital markets and widening credit spreads have in the past, and may in the future, materially adversely affect the liquidity and the value of our investment portfolios, including our residential and commercial mortgage related securities portfolios.\nIn the event additional liquidity is required by one or more of our companies, it may be difficult for us to generate additional liquidity by selling, pledging or otherwise monetizing these or other of our investments at reasonable prices and time frames.\n36 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\nA downgrade by one or more of the rating agencies in the Insurer Financial Strength ratings of our insurance or reinsurance companies could limit their ability to write or prevent them from writing new business and impair their retention of customers and in-force business, and a downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance and reinsurance companies. IFS ratings measure an insurance or reinsurance company\u2019s ability to meet its obligations to contract holders and policyholders.\nCredit rating agencies estimate a company\u2019s ability to meet its ongoing financial obligations and high IFS and credit ratings help maintain public confidence in a company\u2019s products, facilitate marketing of products and enhance a company\u2019s competitive position. Downgrades of the IFS ratings of our insurance or reinsurance companies could prevent these companies from selling, or make it more difficult for them to succeed in selling, products and services, make it more difficult for them to obtain new reinsurance or obtain it on reasonable pricing terms or result in increased policy cancellations, lapses and surrenders, termination of, or increased collateral posting obligations under, assumed reinsurance contracts, or return of premiums. Under credit rating agency policies concerning the relationship between parent and subsidiary ratings, a downgrade in AIG Parent\u2019s credit ratings could result in a downgrade of the IFS ratings of our insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries. Similarly, under credit rating agency policies, a downgrade of the IFS ratings of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries could also result in a downgrade in AIG Parent\u2019s credit ratings.\nIn addition, a downgrade of our long-term debt ratings by one or more of the major rating agencies could potentially increase our financing costs and limit the availability of financing. A downgrade would also require us to post additional collateral payments related to derivative transactions to which we are a party, and could permit the termination of these derivative transactions. Additionally, a downgrade in our IFS or credit ratings could cause counterparties to limit or reduce their exposure to us and thus reduce our ability to manage our market risk exposures effectively during times of market stress. This could adversely affect our business, our consolidated results of operations in a reporting period and/or our liquidity.\nIn response to the announcement by AIG in October 2020 of its intention to separate the Life and Retirement business from AIG, Fitch placed the credit ratings of AIG on \u201cRating Watch Negative,\u201d Moody\u2019s placed the debt ratings of AIG on review for downgrade and S&P placed the credit ratings of AIG and the financial strength ratings of most of the General Insurance subsidiaries on CreditWatch with negative implications. Moody\u2019s and Fitch affirmed the financial strength ratings and outlooks on our insurance subsidiaries. In connection with the announcement by AIG in July 2021 that it reached a definitive agreement with Blackstone to acquire a 9.9 percent equity stake in our Life and Retirement business, Moody\u2019s lowered its debt ratings of AIG to Baa2 from Baa1 and assigned a stable outlook. Moody\u2019s also revised the outlook on the A2 financial strength ratings of our Life and Retirement subsidiaries to negative from stable. A further downgrade in the credit and debt ratings of AIG could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nFor additional information on rating agency actions in response to AIG\u2019s announced intention to separate its Life and Retirement business from AIG, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A - Liquidity and Capital Resources -Rating Agency Actions Related to the Announced Separation of Life and Retirement.\nChanges in the method for determining LIBOR and the continuing phase out of LIBOR and uncertainty related to LIBOR replacement rates may affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We have significant assets, liabilities and obligations with interest rates tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for U.S. dollars and other currencies. Starting January 1, 2022, all LIBOR settings either ceased to be provided by any administrator, or are no longer representative for all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR settings and one-week and two-month U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR settings, and we expect the same will occur immediately after June 30, 2023 for the remaining USD LIBOR settings, absent subsequent action by the relevant authorities. In addition, while GBP and JPY LIBOR is currently being reported on a synthetic basis for certain tenors, there can be no assurance that such non-USD synthetic LIBOR or USD LIBOR will remain available in the future.\nSignificant recommendations as to alternative rates and as to protocols have been advanced, and continue to be advanced, by various regulators and market participants, including the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the United States Federal Reserve (ARRC), the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), the UK FCA and the U.S. Congress, and legislative action by the State of New York, but there can be no assurance that the various recommendations or legislative action will be effective at preventing or mitigating disruption as a result of the transition. In particular, for U.S. dollar LIBOR, the ARRC has selected the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred replacement benchmark and has formally recommended, in limited cases, a term rate based on SOFR; both ARRC and ISDA have taken significant steps toward implementing various fallback provisions and protocols; and for British pound sterling, relevant authorities have promoted use of Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) as a replacement for LIBOR. However, the market transition away from LIBOR to alternative reference rates, including SOFR or SONIA, is complex and could result in disruptions, among other things, due to differences between LIBOR (an unsecured forward-looking term rate) and alternative rates that are based on historical measures of overnight secured rates; due to failure of market participants to fully accept such alternative rates; or due to difficulties in amending legacy LIBOR contracts or implementing processes for determining new alternative rates.\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 37\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\nThe consequences of LIBOR reform could adversely affect the market for LIBOR-based securities, the payment obligations under our existing LIBOR-based liabilities and our ability to issue funding agreements bearing a floating rate of interest, as well as the value of financial and insurance products tied to LIBOR, investment portfolio or the substantial amount of derivatives contracts we use to hedge our assets, insurance and other liabilities.\nOur actions taken to address the transition from LIBOR for U.S. dollar and other currencies and to mitigate potential risks include, among other things, ensuring new legal contracts, existing legal contracts if necessary and our asset and debt issuances include appropriate LIBOR fallback provisions and identifying fallback provisions in existing contracts and investments which mature after the relevant LIBOR phase-out date; updating valuation and actuarial models that utilize LIBOR; determining the impact of new accounting and tax requirements; adjusting applicable technology applications to be able to support both LIBOR and new alternative rates; and executing and monitoring trades (including test transactions) for derivatives, assets and debt issuances utilizing the new alternative reference rates. We cannot, however, be certain that these measures will effectively mitigate potential risks related to the transition from LIBOR. In addition, we anticipate there may be additional risks to our current processes and information systems that will need to be identified and evaluated by us. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates or other reforms could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nBusiness and operations\nNo assurances can be given that the separation of our Life and Retirement business will occur or as to the specific terms or timing thereof. In addition, the separation could cause the emergence or exacerbate the effects of other risks to which AIG is exposed. On October 26, 2020, AIG announced its intention to separate its Life and Retirement business from AIG. On November 2, 2021, Blackstone acquired a 9.9 percent equity stake in SAFG, which is the holding company for AIG\u2019s Life and Retirement business, for $2.2 billion in an all cash transaction, subject to adjustment if the final pro forma adjusted book value is greater or lesser than the target pro forma adjusted book value. Similar to other business dispositions, the separation involves a number of risks, including (i) unanticipated developments that may delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect our ability to effect a separation; (ii) significant costs and disruption or distraction of management from AIG\u2019s other business operations, whether or not a separation is completed; (iii) satisfaction of various conditions and approvals, including approval by the AIG Board of Directors, and receipt of insurance and other required regulatory approvals, and satisfaction of any applicable requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission; (iv) other regulatory requirements that could impact our operations or capital requirements or delay or impede completion of a separation; (v) rating agency actions; (vi) unforeseen losses, liabilities or asset impairment arising from the structure of any definitive separation transaction; and (vii) if we are successful in separating the business, increased concentration of our business operations. Further, a valuation allowance may need to be established in the reporting period in which tax deconsolidation occurs with respect to certain tax loss and credit carryforwards to the extent the deconsolidation of the Life and Retirement entities from the AIG consolidated federal income tax group affects our ability to utilize such tax attributes. While we currently believe that, following the sale of 9.9 percent equity stake in SAFG to Blackstone, an initial public offering is the next step in the separation of the Life and Retirement business from AIG, no assurance can be given regarding the form that future separation transactions may take or the specific terms or timing thereof, or that a separation will in fact occur.\nIn addition, the separation of our Life and Retirement business, if completed, could cause the emergence or exacerbate the effects of many of the other risks noted herein, including: (i) the risk of indemnity claims that could be made against us in connection with divested businesses; (ii) our ability to utilize certain tax loss and credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income going forward; (iii) competition for employees and managing retention of key employees; (iv) maintaining relationships with certain key distributors; (v) concentration of our insurance and other risk exposures; and (vi) increased exposure to certain risks related to deriving revenue from non-U.S. sources. A significant delay in the consummation of the separation could also exacerbate these risks.\nFor information regarding risks associated with rating agency actions, see Liquidity, Capital and Credit - \u201cA downgrade by one or more of the rating agencies in the Insurer Financial Strength ratings of our insurance or reinsurance companies could limit their ability to write or prevent them from writing new business and impair their retention of customers and in-force business, and a downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity\u201d above. In addition, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Rating Agency Actions Related to the Announced Separation of Life and Retirement; see also \u201cBusiness or asset acquisitions and dispositions may expose us to certain risks\u201d below.\nFailure to effectively execute on AIG 200 could result in costs that are greater than expected, savings that are less than expected and disruption to our businesses that could have a material effect on our operations or financial condition. In 2019, we announced AIG 200, our global, multi-year and enterprise-wide program involving transformational change across the Company. AIG 200 is comprised of ten operational programs mapped against four core objectives that are complex and require significant investment and resource prioritization. While we are already two years into a three-year program and have delivered on multiple milestones, we still may not fully achieve some or all of the expected benefits from these operational programs, and the work we are undertaking could result in disruption to our businesses and loss of talent. Other risks associated with AIG 200 include delays\n38 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\nin execution across the programs, particularly with respect to implementation of technology platforms, lack of sufficient resources to execute on a timely basis, inefficiencies stemming from changes that may be required to programs or sequencing, failure to meet operational and financial targets due to additional priorities or other factors, and the inability to secure regulatory approvals, if and when needed. These risks may impair our ability to achieve anticipated improvements in our businesses or may otherwise harm our operations which could materially and adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and cash flow.\nPricing for our products is subject to our ability to adequately assess risks and estimate related losses. We seek to price our insurance and reinsurance products such that premiums, policy fees and other charges and future net investment income earned on revenues received will result in an acceptable profit in excess of expected claims, assumed expenses and the cost of capital. Our business is dependent on our ability to price our products effectively and charge appropriate premiums. Pricing adequacy depends on a number of factors and assumptions, including proper evaluation of insurance risks, our expense levels, expected net investment income to be realized, our response to rate actions taken by competitors, legal and regulatory developments and the ability to obtain regulatory approval for rate changes. For example, some of our life insurance policies and annuity contracts provide management the right to adjust certain nonguaranteed charges or benefits and interest crediting rates if necessary; however, this right is limited and may be subject to guaranteed minimums or maximums, and the exercise of these rights could result in reputational and/or litigation risk. Management establishes target returns for each product based upon the factors described above, certain underwriting assumptions and capital requirements, including statutory, GAAP and economic capital models. We monitor and manage pricing and sales to achieve target returns on new business, but we may not be able to achieve those returns due to the factors discussed above. Inadequate pricing and the difference between estimated results of the above factors compared to actual results could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our operations and our financial condition.\nGuarantees within certain of our products may increase the volatility of our results. Certain of our annuity and life insurance products include features that guarantee a certain level of benefits, including guaranteed minimum death benefits, guaranteed living benefits, and products with guaranteed interest crediting rates, including crediting rate guarantees tied to the performance of various market indices. Many of these features are accounted for at fair value as embedded derivatives under GAAP, and they have significant exposure to capital markets and insurance risks. An increase in valuation of liabilities associated with the guaranteed features results in a decrease in our profitability and depending on the magnitude of any such increase, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, including our capitalization, as well as our financial strength ratings.\nWe employ a capital markets hedging strategy to partially offset the economic impacts of movements in equity, interest rate and credit markets, however, our hedging strategy may not effectively offset movements in our GAAP and statutory surplus and may otherwise be insufficient in relation to our obligations. Furthermore, we are subject to the risk that changes in policyholder behavior or actual levels of mortality/longevity as compared to assumptions in pricing, combined with adverse market events, could produce losses not addressed by the risk management techniques employed. These factors, individually or collectively, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity including our ability to receive dividends from our operating companies.\nFor information regarding market risk management related to these product features see Part II, Item 7. MD&A - Enterprise Risk Management - Insurance Risks - Life and Retirement Companies\u2019 Key Risks - Variable Annuity, Index Annuity and Universal Risk Management and Hedging Programs.\nDifferences between the change in fair value of the GAAP embedded derivatives, as well as associated statutory and tax liabilities, and the value of the related hedging portfolio may occur and can be caused by movements in the level of equity, interest rate and credit markets, market volatility, policyholder behavior and mortality/longevity rates that differ from our assumptions and our inability to purchase hedging instruments at prices consistent with the desired risk and return trade-off. The occurrence of one or more of these events has in the past resulted in, and could in the future result in, an increase in the fair value of liabilities associated with the guaranteed benefits or decline in the value of our hedges, or a decline in the value of our hedges without an offsetting decline in our liabilities, thus reducing our pre-tax net income and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nWhile we believe that our actions have reduced the risks related to guaranteed benefits and guaranteed interest crediting, our risk exposures are not fully, and may not be effectively, hedged.\nFor additional information on these products see Notes 4 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Item 1. Business - Regulation and Part II, Item 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates - Liabilities for Guaranteed Benefit Features of Variable Annuity, Fixed Annuity and Fixed Index Annuity Products.\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 39\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\nOur foreign operations expose us to risks that may affect our operations. We provide insurance, reinsurance, investment and other financial products and services to both businesses and individuals in approximately 70 countries and jurisdictions. A substantial portion of our business is conducted outside the United States, and we intend to continue to grow our business in strategic markets. Operations outside the United States have in the past been, and may in the future be, affected by regional economic downturns, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, political events or upheaval, sanctions policies, nationalization and other restrictive government or regulatory actions, which could also affect our other operations.\nThe degree of regulation and supervision in foreign jurisdictions varies. AIG subsidiaries operating in foreign jurisdictions must satisfy local regulatory requirements and it is possible that local licenses may require AIG Parent to meet certain conditions. Licenses issued by foreign authorities to our subsidiaries are subject to modification and revocation. Consequently, our insurance subsidiaries could be prevented from conducting future business in some of the jurisdictions where they currently operate. Adverse actions from any single country could adversely affect our results of operations, depending on the magnitude of the event and our financial exposure at that time in that country.\nIn addition, AIG Parent and its subsidiaries are subject to various extraterritorial laws and regulations, including such laws adopted by the United States that affect how we do business around the world. These laws and regulations may conflict and we may incur penalties and/or reputational harm if we fail to adhere to them. For example, increased international data localization and cross-border data transfer regulatory restrictions and anti-sanctions laws may affect how we do business around the world and may cause us to incur penalties and/or suffer reputational harm.\nOur restructuring initiatives may not yield our expected reductions in expenses and improvements in operational and organizational efficiency. Outside of our AIG 200 transformational program and announced plan to separate the Life and Retirement business, we continue to undertake certain restructuring initiatives in the ordinary course of business. We may not be able to fully realize the anticipated expense reductions and operational and organizational efficiency improvements because the actual costs to implement these initiatives may exceed our estimates or we may be unable to fully implement and execute these initiatives as planned. Our businesses and results of operations may be negatively impacted if we are unable to realize these anticipated expense reductions and efficiency improvements or if implementing these initiatives harms our relationships with customers or employees or our competitive position. The successful implementation of these initiatives may continue to require us to effect workforce reductions, business rationalizations, systems enhancements, business process outsourcing, business and asset dispositions and acquisitions and other actions, which depend on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nWe may experience difficulty in marketing and distributing products through our current and future distribution channels and the use of third parties may result in additional liabilities. Although we distribute our products through a wide variety of distribution channels, we maintain relationships with certain key distributors. Distributors have in the past, and may in the future, elect to renegotiate the terms of existing relationships, limit the products they sell, including the types of products offered by us, or otherwise reduce or terminate their distribution relationships with us, with or without cause. This could be due to various reasons, such as industry consolidation of distributors or other industry changes that increase the competition for access to distributors, developments in laws or regulations that affect our business or industry, including the marketing and sale of our products and services, adverse developments in our business, strategic decisions that impact our business, adverse rating agency actions or concerns about market-related risks. An interruption or reduction in certain key relationships could materially affect our ability to market our products and could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, operating results and financial condition.\nAlternatively, renegotiated terms may not be attractive or acceptable to distributors, or we may terminate one or more distribution agreements due to, for example, a loss of confidence in, or a change in control of, one of the third-party distributors. An interruption or reduction in certain key relationships could materially affect our ability to market our products and could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nIn addition, we can, in certain circumstances, be held responsible for the actions of our distributors, including broker-dealers, registered representatives, insurance agents and agencies, marketing organizations, and their respective employees, agents and representatives, in connection with the marketing and sale of our products by such parties and persons in a manner that is deemed not compliant with applicable laws and regulations. This is particularly acute with respect to unaffiliated distributors where we may not be able to directly monitor or control the manner in which our products are sold through third-party firms despite our training and compliance programs. Further, misconduct by employees, agents and representatives of our broker-dealer subsidiaries in the sale of our products could also result in violations of law by us or our subsidiaries, regulatory sanctions and serious reputational or financial harm. The precautions we take to prevent and detect the foregoing activities may not be effective. If our products are distributed to customers for whom they are unsuitable or distributed in a manner deemed inappropriate, we could suffer reputational and/or other financial harm to our business.\nFor information regarding suitability standards, see Item 1. Business - Regulation - U.S. Regulation.\n40 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\nWe are exposed to certain risks if we are unable to maintain the availability of our critical technology systems and data and safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of our data, which could compromise our ability to conduct business and adversely affect our consolidated business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We use information technology systems, infrastructure and networks and other operational systems to store, retrieve, evaluate and use customer, employee, and company data and information. Our business is highly dependent on our ability to access these systems and networks to perform necessary business functions. In the event of a natural disaster, a computer virus, unauthorized access, a terrorist attack, cyberattack or other disruption inside or outside the U.S., our systems may be inaccessible to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time, and we may be unable to meet our business obligations for an extended period of time if our data or systems are disabled, manipulated, destroyed or otherwise compromised. Additionally, some of our systems and networks are older, legacy-type systems that are less efficient and require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain or upgrade. Supply chain disruptions or delays could prevent us from maintaining and implementing changes, updates and upgrades to our systems and networks in a timely manner or at all. System and network failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform business functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business, hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers and expose us to legal claims as well as regulatory investigations and sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nSome of these systems and networks also rely upon third-party systems, which themselves may rely on the systems of other third parties. Problems caused by, or occurring in relation to, our third-party providers and systems, including those resulting from breakdowns or other disruptions in information technology services provided by a third-party provider, failure of a third-party provider to provide current or higher volumes of required services or cyber-attacks and security breaches at a third-party provider may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nLike other global companies, the systems and networks we maintain and third party systems and networks we use have in the past been, and will likely in the future be, subject to or targets of unauthorized or fraudulent access, including physical or electronic break-ins or unauthorized tampering, as well as attempted cyber and other security threats and other computer-related penetrations such as \u201cdenial of service\u201d attacks, phishing, untargeted but sophisticated and automated attacks, and other disruptive software. Also, like other global companies, we have an increasing challenge of attracting and retaining highly qualified security personnel to assist us in combatting these security threats. The frequency and sophistication of such threats continue to increase and often become further heightened in connection with geopolitical tensions.\nWe continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure in an effort to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of threats to our data, systems and networks, including malware and computer virus attacks, ransomware, unauthorized access, business e-mail compromise, misuse, denial-of-service attacks, system failures and disruptions. There is no assurance that our security measures, including information security policies, administrative, technical and physical controls and other actions designed as preventative, will provide fully effective protection from such events. AIG maintains insurance to cover operational risks, such as cyber risk and technology outages, but this insurance may not cover all costs associated with the consequences of personal, confidential or proprietary information being compromised. In some cases, such compromise may not be immediately detected which may make it difficult to recover critical services, damage assets and compromise the integrity and security of data including our policyholder, employee, agent, and other confidential information processed through our systems and networks. Additionally, since we rely heavily on information technology and systems and on the integrity and timeliness of data to run our businesses and service our customers, any such compromise or security event and may impede or interrupt our business operations and our ability to service our customers, and otherwise may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe are continuously evaluating and enhancing systems and processes. These continued enhancements and changes, as well as changes designed to update and enhance our protective measures to address new threats, may increase the risk of a system or process failure or the creation of a gap in the associated security measures. Any such failure or gap could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nWe routinely transmit, receive and store personal, confidential and proprietary information by email and other electronic means. Although we attempt to keep such information confidential and secure, we may be unable to do so in all events, especially with clients, vendors, service providers, counterparties and other third parties who may not have or use appropriate controls to protect personal, confidential or proprietary information. The compromise of personal, confidential or proprietary information could cause a loss of data, give rise to remediation or other expenses, expose us to liability under U.S. and international laws and regulations, and subject us to litigation, investigations, sanctions, and regulatory and law enforcement action, and result in reputational harm and loss of business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 41\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\nFurthermore, certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with laws and regulations enacted by U.S. federal and state governments, the European Union or other jurisdictions or enacted by various regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to the privacy and security of the information of clients, employees or others. The variety of applicable privacy and information security laws and regulations exposes us to heightened regulatory scrutiny, requires us to incur significant technical, legal and other expenses in an effort to ensure and maintain compliance and will continue to impact our business in the future by increasing legal, operational and compliance costs. While we have taken steps to comply with privacy and information security laws, we cannot guarantee that our efforts will meet the evolving standards imposed by data protection authorities. If we are found not to be in compliance with these privacy and security laws and regulations, we may be subject to additional potential private consumer, business partner or securities litigation, regulatory inquiries, and governmental investigations and proceedings, and we may incur damage to our reputation. Any such developments may subject us to material fines and other monetary penalties and damages, divert management\u2019s time and attention, and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, we expect that developments in privacy and cybersecurity worldwide will increase the financial and reputational implications following a significant breach of our or our third-party suppliers\u2019 information technology systems. New and currently unforeseen regulatory issues could also arise from the increased use of emerging technology, data and digital services. If we are found not to be in compliance with these laws and regulations concerning emerging technology, data and digital services, we could be subjected to significant civil and criminal liability and exposed to reputational harm. For additional information on privacy, data protection and cybersecurity regulations. For additional information on data protection and cybersecurity regulations, see Item 1. Business - Regulation - U.S. Regulation - Privacy, Data Protection and Cybersecurity and - International Regulation - Privacy, Data Protection and Cybersecurity, and Part II, Item 7. MD&A - Enterprise Risk Management - Operational Risk Management - Cybersecurity Risk.\nWe have been required to further rely on our technology systems as a result of the fact that all non-essential staff were transitioned to a remote work environment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and thus, the risk of a gap in our security measures and the risk of a system or process failure is heightened.\nFor information regarding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, see Market Conditions - \u201cCOVID-19 has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our global business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and its ultimate impact will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be predicted\u201d above.\nThird parties we rely upon to provide certain business and administrative services on our behalf may not perform as anticipated, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We rely on the use of third-party providers to deliver contracted services in a broad range of areas. For example, we have engaged with Accenture plc for the delivery of services related to the administration or servicing of certain policies and contracts and investment assets, investment accounting, information technology and operational functions, finance and actuarial services, human resources and information technology services related to infrastructure, application development and maintenance. In addition, in connection with its acquisition of an equity stake in SAFG, AIG entered into a long-term asset management relationship with Blackstone, pursuant to which Blackstone is managing an initial $50 billion of Life and Retirement\u2019s existing investment portfolio, with that amount increasing by increments of $8.5 billion per year for the next five years beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022, for an aggregate of $92.5 billion. For information regarding our reliance on Blackstone as a third-party asset manager, see \u201cOur investment portfolio is concentrated in certain segments of the economy, and the performance and value of our investment portfolio are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including changes in interest rates and credit spreads. In addition, a significant portion of our investment portfolio is now managed by Blackstone, which makes its performance and value subject to Blackstone\u2019s ability to successfully manage it\u201d above.\nSome of these providers are located outside the U.S., which exposes us to business disruptions and political risks inherent when conducting business outside of the U.S. We periodically negotiate provisions and renewals of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us, such third parties or regulators. If such third-party providers experience disruptions, fail to meet applicable licensure requirements, do not perform as anticipated or in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, terminate or fail to renew our relationships, or such third-party providers in turn rely on services from another third-party provider, who experiences such disruptions, licensure failures, nonperformance or noncompliance, termination or non-renewal of its contractual relationships, we may experience operational difficulties, an inability to meet obligations (including, but not limited to, contractual, legal, regulatory or policyholder obligations), a loss of business, increased costs or reputational harm, compromises to our data integrity, or suffer other negative consequences, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Third parties performing regulated activities on our behalf, such as sales and servicing of insurance products, pose a heightened risk as we may be held accountable for third party conduct that is not in compliance with applicable law.\n42 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\nFor information regarding cyber risk arising from third-party providers, see Business and Operations - \u201cWe are exposed to certain risks if we are unable to maintain the availability of our critical technology systems and data and safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of our data, which could compromise our ability to conduct business and adversely affect our consolidated business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity\u201d above.\nFor information regarding increased risks arising from our reliance on third parties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, see Market Conditions - \u201cCOVID-19 has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our global business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and its ultimate impact will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be predicted\u201d above.\nBusiness or asset acquisitions and dispositions may expose us to certain risks. The completion of any business or asset acquisition or disposition is subject to certain risks, including those relating to the receipt of required regulatory approvals, the terms and conditions of regulatory approvals including any financial accommodations required by regulators, our ability to satisfy such terms, conditions and accommodations, the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of a transaction and the risk that parties may not be willing or able to satisfy the conditions to a transaction. As a result, there can be no assurance that any business or asset acquisition or disposition will be completed as contemplated, or at all, or regarding the expected timing of the completion of the acquisition or disposition. For example, on October 26, 2020, AIG announced its intention to separate its Life and Retirement business from AIG. While we currently believe that, following the sale of a 9.9 percent equity stake in SAFG to Blackstone, an initial public offering is the next step in the separation of the Life and Retirement business from AIG, no assurance can be given regarding the form that future separation transactions may take or the specific terms or timing thereof, or that a separation will in fact occur. In addition, any separation transaction will be subject to the satisfaction of various conditions and approvals, including approval by the AIG Board of Directors, receipt of insurance and other required regulatory approvals, and satisfaction of any applicable requirements of the SEC. There can be no guarantee that we will receive the required approvals or that closing conditions will be satisfied in order to consummate the separation of the Life and Retirement business and for any other disposition.\nOnce we complete acquisitions or dispositions, there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated economic, strategic or other benefits of any transaction. For example, the integration of businesses we acquire may not be as successful as we anticipate or there may be undisclosed risks present in such businesses. Acquisitions involve a number of risks, including operational, strategic, financial, accounting, legal, compliance and tax risks. Difficulties integrating an acquired business may result in the acquired business performing differently than we expected (including through the loss of customers) or in our failure to realize anticipated expense-related efficiencies. Our existing businesses could also be negatively impacted by acquisitions. Risks resulting from future acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In connection with a business or asset disposition, we may also hold a concentrated position in securities of the acquirer as part of the consideration, which subjects us to risks related to the price of equity securities and our ability to monetize such securities. In addition, with respect to certain dispositions, we are subject to regulatory and other restrictions on our use of proceeds. We have also provided and may provide financial guarantees and indemnities in connection with the businesses we have sold or may sell, as described in greater detail in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. While we do not currently believe that claims under these indemnities will be material, it is possible that significant indemnity claims could be made against us. If such a claim or claims were successful, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nFor additional information regarding the risks associated with AIG\u2019s separation of its Life and Retirement business, see Business and Operations - \u201cNo assurances can be given that the separation of our Life and Retirement business will occur or as to the specific terms or timing thereof. In addition, the separation could cause the emergence or exacerbate the effects of other risks to which AIG is exposed\u201d above.\nFor additional information on these financial guarantees and indemnities, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSignificant legal or regulatory proceedings may adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In the normal course of business, we face significant risk from regulatory and governmental investigations and civil actions, litigation and other forms of dispute resolution in various domestic and foreign jurisdictions. In our insurance and reinsurance operations, we frequently engage in litigation and arbitration concerning the scope of coverage under insurance and reinsurance contracts, and face litigation and arbitration in which our subsidiaries defend or indemnify their insureds under insurance and reinsurance contracts. Additionally, from time to time, various regulatory and governmental agencies review the transactions and practices of AIG and our subsidiaries in connection with industry-wide and other inquiries into, among other matters, the business practices of current and former operating insurance subsidiaries. Such investigations, inquiries or examinations have and could develop into administrative, civil or criminal proceedings or enforcement actions, in which remedies could include fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, and could result in additional expenses, limitations on certain business activities and reputational damage.\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 43\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\nAIG, our subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors are also subject to, or may become subject to, a variety of additional types of legal disputes brought by holders of AIG securities, customers, employees and others, alleging, among other things, breach of contractual or fiduciary duties, bad faith, indemnification and violations of federal and state statutes and regulations. Certain of these matters may also involve potentially significant risk of loss due to the possibility of significant jury awards and settlements, punitive damages or other penalties. Many of these matters are also highly complex and seek recovery on behalf of a class or similarly large number of plaintiffs. It is therefore inherently difficult to predict the size or scope of potential future losses arising from them, and developments in these matters could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations.\nFor information regarding certain legal proceedings, including certain tax controversies, see Notes 15 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor information regarding potential litigation exposure as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, see Market Conditions - \u201cCOVID-19 has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our global business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and its ultimate impact will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be predicted\u201d above.\nIncreasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from investors, customers, regulators and other stakeholders regarding environmental, social and governance matters may adversely affect our reputation or otherwise adversely impact our business and results of operations. There is increasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from investors, customers, regulators and other stakeholders on ESG practices and disclosures, including those related to environmental stewardship, climate change, diversity, equity and inclusion, racial justice and workplace conduct. Regulators have imposed and likely will continue to impose ESG-related rules and guidance, which may conflict with one another and impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks. Moreover, certain organizations that provide information to investors have developed ratings for evaluating companies on their approach to different ESG matters, and unfavorable ratings of our company or our industries may lead to negative investor sentiment and the diversion of investment to other companies or industries. In 2021, we published our first ESG report detailing the Company\u2019s ESG assessments and priorities and made a commitment to reduce our operational carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. If we are unable to meet these targets, standards, or expectations, whether established by us or third parties, it could result in adverse publicity, reputational harm, or loss of customer and/or investor confidence, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFor information on the effects of climate change on our business, see Reserves and Exposures - \u201cClimate change may adversely affect our business and financial condition\u201d above.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may prove to be ineffective and leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. We have developed and continue to enhance enterprise-wide risk management policies and procedures to identify, monitor and mitigate risk and loss to which we are exposed, which include hedging programs designed to manage market risk and reinsurance to manage geographic accumulations. There are, however, inherent limitations to risk management strategies because there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not sufficiently or accurately anticipated or identified. For example, our hedging programs utilize various derivative instruments, including but not limited to equity options, futures contracts, interest rate swaps and swaptions, as well as other hedging instruments, which may not effectively or completely reduce our risk; and assumptions underlying models used to measure accumulations and support reinsurance purchases may prove inaccurate and could leave us exposed to larger than expected catastrophe losses in a given year. In addition, our current business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be sufficient to reduce the impact of pandemics and other natural or man-made catastrophic events that are beyond our anticipated thresholds or impact tolerances.\nIf our risk management policies and procedures are ineffective, we may suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected. As our businesses change and the markets in which we operate evolve and new risks emerge, including for example risks related to climate change or meeting stakeholder expectations relating to environmental, social or governance issues, our risk management framework may not evolve at the same pace as those changes. As a result, there is a risk that new products or new business strategies may present risks that are not appropriately identified, monitored or managed. The effectiveness of our risk management strategies may be limited, resulting in losses, because of market stress, unanticipated financial market movements or unanticipated claims experience from adverse mortality, morbidity or policyholder behavior. In addition, there can be no assurance that we can effectively review and monitor all risks or that all of our employees will understand and follow (or comply with) our risk management policies and procedures.\n44 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property and may be subject to infringement claims. We rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. Effective intellectual property rights protection may be unavailable, limited, or subject to change in some countries where we do or plan to do business. Although we use a broad range of measures to protect our intellectual property rights, third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. We have, and may in the future, litigate to enforce and protect our intellectual property and to determine its scope, validity or enforceability, which could divert significant resources and may not prove successful. Litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights may not be successful and cost a significant amount of money. The loss of intellectual property protection or the inability to secure or enforce the protection of our intellectual property assets could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete. Third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents or other protections that could be infringed by our products, methods, processes or services or could limit our ability to offer certain product features. Consequently, we also may be subject to costly litigation in the event that another party alleges our operations or activities infringe upon their intellectual property rights, including patent rights, or violate license usage rights. Any such intellectual property claims and any resulting litigation could result in significant expense and liability for damages, and in some circumstances we could be enjoined from providing certain products or services to our customers, or utilizing and benefiting from certain patent, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses, or alternatively could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nREGULATION\nOur businesses are heavily regulated and changes in laws and regulations may affect our operations, increase our insurance subsidiary capital requirements or reduce our profitability. Our operations generally, and our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries in particular, are subject to extensive and potentially conflicting laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our business and financial condition are also subject to supervision and regulation by authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we do business. Federal, state and foreign regulators also periodically review and investigate our insurance and reinsurance businesses, including AIG-specific and industry-wide practices. The primary purpose of insurance regulation is the protection of our insurance and reinsurance contract holders. The extent of regulation on our insurance and reinsurance business varies across the jurisdictions where we operate, but generally is governed by laws that delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to insurance departments and similar regulatory agencies. The laws and regulations that apply to our business and operations generally grant regulatory agencies and/or self-regulatory organizations broad rulemaking and enforcement powers, including the power to regulate the issuance, sale and distribution of our products, the manner in which we underwrite our policies, the delivery of our services, the nature or extent of disclosures that we give our customers, the compensation of our distribution partners, the manner in which we handle claims on our policies and the administration of our policies and contracts, as well as the power to limit or restrict our business for failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Our Life and Retirement companies and their distributors are also subject to laws and regulations governing the standard of care applicable to sales of our products, the provision of advice to our customers and the manner in which certain conflicts of interest arising from or related to such sales or giving of advice are to be addressed. In addition, federal and state securities laws and regulations apply to certain of our insurance products that are considered \u2018securities\u2019 under such laws, including our variable annuity contracts, variable life insurance policies and the separate accounts that issue them, as well as our broker-dealer, investment advisor and mutual fund operations.\nFor additional information on the regulatory regimes we are subject to, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the standard of care-related regulations administered by the DOL, see Item 1. Business - Regulation - U.S. Regulation.\nSignificant legislative and regulatory activity has occurred at both the U.S. federal and state levels, as well as globally, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on insurance consumers. While some of these legislative and regulatory initiatives have expired, any resurgence of the COVID-19 virus may lead to a renewal of those initiatives. We cannot predict what form future legal and regulatory responses to concerns about COVID-19 and related public health issues will take, or how such responses will impact our business.\nWe strive to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our businesses, operations and legal entities, including maintenance of all required licenses and approvals. The application of and compliance with such laws and regulations may be subject to interpretation, evolving industry practices and regulatory expectations that could result in increased compliance costs. The relevant authorities may not agree with our interpretation of these laws and regulations, including, for example, our implementation of new or revised requirements related to capital, accounting treatment or reserving such as those governing PBR, or with our policies and procedures adopted to address evolving industry practices or meet regulatory expectations. Such authorities\u2019 interpretations and views may also change from time to time. It is also possible that the laws, regulations and interpretations across various jurisdictions in which we do business may conflict with one another and affect how we do business in the United States and globally. If we are found not to have complied with applicable legal or regulatory requirements, these authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 45\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\nsome or all of our activities, impose substantial administrative penalties such as fines or require corrective actions, which individually or in the aggregate could interrupt our operations and materially and adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, when such authorities\u2019 interpretation of new or revised requirements related to capital, accounting treatment and/or valuation manual or reserving (such as PBR) materially differs from ours, we have incurred or may incur higher operating costs, or sales of products subject to such requirements or treatment may be affected.\nIn the United States, the RBC formula is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer\u2019s statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. Regulators in other jurisdictions in which we do business have adopted capital and liquidity standards applicable to insurers and reinsurers operating in their jurisdiction. Failure to comply with such RBC capital, liquidity and similar requirements, or as otherwise may be agreed by us or one of our insurance company subsidiaries with an insurance regulator, would generally permit the insurance regulator to take certain regulatory actions that could materially impact the affected company\u2019s operations. Those actions range from requiring an insurer to submit a plan describing how it would regain a specified RBC ratio to a mandatory regulatory takeover of the company. The NAIC and the IAIS are also developing and testing methodologies for assessing group-wide regulatory capital, which might evolve into more formal group-wide capital requirements on certain insurance companies and/or their holding companies that may augment state-law RBC standards, and similar international standards, that apply at the legal entity level, and such capital calculations may be made, in whole or in part, on bases other than the statutory statements of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. We cannot predict the effect these initiatives may have on our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe also cannot predict the impact that laws and regulations adopted in foreign jurisdictions may have on the financial markets generally or our businesses, results of operations or cash flows. It is possible such laws and regulations, our satisfaction of the IAIG criteria and certain standard-setting initiatives by the FSB and the IAIS, including, but not limited to, the IAIS\u2019 Common Framework for the Supervision of IAIGs, a holistic framework for the assessment and mitigation of systemic risk and the development and refinement of a risk-based global ICS, Solvency II and European Data Protection Board Cross Border Data Transfer in the European Union, may significantly alter our business practices. For example, regulators have imposed and may continue to impose new requirements or issue new guidance aimed at addressing or mitigating climate change-related risks. They may also limit our ability to engage in capital or liability management, require us to raise additional capital, and impose burdensome requirements and additional costs. It is also possible that the laws and regulations adopted in foreign jurisdictions will differ from one another, and that they could be inconsistent with the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions in which we operate, including the United States.\nFor additional information on our regulatory environment, see Item 1. Business - Regulation.\nFor information regarding the effects of regulations related to climate change on our business, see Reserves and Exposures - \u201cClimate change may adversely affect our business and financial condition\u201d above.\nFor information regarding the regulatory response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Market Conditions - \u201cCOVID-19 has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our global business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and its ultimate impact will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be predicted\u201d above.\nNew laws and regulations or new interpretations of current laws and regulations, both domestically and internationally, may affect our businesses, results of operations, financial condition and ability to compete effectively. Legislators, regulators and self-regulatory organizations have in the past, and may in the future, periodically consider various proposals that may affect or restrict, among other things, our business practices, product designs and distribution relationships, how we market, sell or service certain products we offer, our capital, reserving and accounting requirements, or the profitability of certain of our businesses. For example, our life insurance and annuity products provide the customer with certain federal income tax advantages. A tax law change that eliminates all or a portion of these advantages may reduce the demand from consumers for our products and change the likelihood of customers surrendering or rolling over existing contracts.\nFurther, new laws and regulations may affect or significantly limit our ability to conduct certain businesses at all, including proposals relating to restrictions on the type of activities in which financial institutions are permitted to engage. These proposals or changes in legislation or regulation could also impose additional taxes on a limited subset of financial institutions and insurance companies (either based on size, activities, geography or other criteria), limit our ability to engage in capital or liability management, require us to raise additional capital, and impose burdensome requirements and additional costs. It is uncertain whether and how these and other such proposals or changes in legislation or regulation would apply to us, those who sell or service our products, or our competitors or how they could impact our ability to compete effectively, as well as our business, consolidated results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nFor information regarding the regulatory response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Market Conditions - \u201cCOVID-19 has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our global business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and its ultimate impact will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be predicted\u201d above.\n46 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\nFor information regarding climate change on our business, see Reserves and Exposures - \u201cClimate change may adversely affect our business and financial condition\u201d above.\nCertain provisions of Dodd-Frank remain relevant to insurance groups generally, including AIG. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) rescinded our designation as a nonbank SIFI on September 29, 2017, but the Council remains authorized under Dodd-Frank to determine, subject to certain statutory and regulatory standards and to the Council\u2019s guidance, which was recently changed to favor an activities-based approach to systemic risk identification and mitigation, that certain nonbank financial companies be designated as nonbank SIFIs subject to supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and enhanced prudential standards. The Council may also recommend that state insurance regulators or other regulators apply new or heightened standards and safeguards for activities or practices that we and other insurers or other nonbank financial services companies, including insurers, engage in. Additionally, Dodd-Frank directs existing and newly created government agencies and bodies to promulgate regulations implementing the law, which is an ongoing process. There remains considerable uncertainty as to the potential adoption and timing of additional regulatory changes related to Dodd-Frank. We cannot predict the requirements of any additional regulations that may be ultimately adopted or the impact they may have on our businesses, consolidated results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nFor additional information on provisions of Dodd-Frank that remain relevant to insurance groups generally, see Item 1. Business - Regulation - U.S. Regulation - Dodd-Frank.\nAn \u201cownership change\u201d could limit our ability to utilize tax loss and credit carryforwards to offset future taxable income. As of December 31, 2021, on a U.S. GAAP basis, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $27.6 billion and $0.3 billion in foreign tax credits. Our ability to use these tax attributes to offset future taxable income may be significantly limited if we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. In general, an ownership change will occur when the percentage of AIG Parent's ownership (measured by value) by one or more \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) has increased by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage owned by such shareholders at any time during the prior three years (calculated on a rolling basis). An entity that experiences an ownership change generally will be subject to an annual limitation on its utilization of pre-ownership change tax loss and credit carryforwards equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term, tax-exempt rate posted monthly by the IRS (AFR) (subject to certain adjustments). The annual limitation would be increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year. The limitation on our ability to utilize tax loss and credit carryforwards arising from an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code would be dependent on the value of our equity and the AFR at the time of any ownership change. If we were to experience an \u201cownership change\u201d, it is possible that a significant portion of our tax loss and credit carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them to offset future taxable income.\nOur shareholders have adopted a protective amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (Protective Amendment), which is designed to prevent certain transfers of AIG Common Stock that could result in an \u201cownership change\u201d. Further, we have a Tax Asset Protection Plan (the Plan) in place, which is designed to reduce the likelihood of an \u201cownership change\u201d by (i) discouraging any person or group from becoming a 4.99 percent shareholder and (ii) discouraging any existing 4.99 percent shareholder from acquiring additional shares of AIG Common Stock. The Protective Amendment generally restricts any transfer of AIG Common Stock that would (i) increase the ownership by any person to 4.99 percent or more of AIG Common Stock then outstanding or (ii) increase the percentage of AIG Common Stock owned by a Five Percent Stockholder (as defined in the Plan). Despite the intentions of the Plan and the Protective Amendment to deter and prevent an \u201cownership change\u201d, such an event may still occur. In addition, the Plan and the Protective Amendment may make it more difficult and more expensive to acquire us, and may discourage open market purchases of AIG Common Stock or a non-negotiated tender or exchange offer for AIG Common Stock. Accordingly, the Plan and the Protective Amendment may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to realize a premium over the market price of AIG Common Stock in connection with any stock transaction. The Plan is currently set to expire on December 11, 2022, but our Board of Directors may, consistent with past practice, adopt an amendment to extend the Plan beyond this expiration date. The Protective Amendment will expire on May 13, 2023 but may be extended by our shareholders in similar fashion.\nChanges to tax laws could increase our corporate taxes or make some of our products less attractive to consumers. The current United States administration and Congressional leadership have proposed changes to the U.S. corporate and international tax systems, as well as increasing the taxation of U.S. individuals, including capital gains taxation.\nAn increase in the statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate will negatively impact AIG\u2019s future after-tax earnings. Other changes, such as a proposed minimum tax on book income could impact AIG\u2019s after-tax earnings or cash flow.\nThe administration and Congressional leadership have also proposed changes to complex provisions in the U.S. international tax system, including the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT) and global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). These changes could impact AIG\u2019s after-tax earnings or cash flow. Furthermore, there is the possibility of further regulatory guidance on certain aspects of the BEAT and GILTI, which could impact the amounts recorded with respect to these international provisions, possibly materially.\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 47\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\nIn addition to changing the taxation of corporations in general, there are proposals for increases in tax rates for individuals, capital gains, and changes to the estate tax. These changes could impact demand in the U.S. for life insurance and annuity contracts.\nNew tax laws outside the U.S. similar to BEAT or enacted in response to proposals by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in the European Union could make substantive changes to the global international tax regime. Such changes could impact cross border reinsurance transactions, which could increase our tax costs globally.\nFinally, it is possible that tax laws will be further changed either in a technical corrections bill or entirely new legislation. It remains difficult to predict whether or when there will be any tax law changes or further guidance by the authorities in the U.S. or elsewhere in the world having a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as the impact of proposals on our business can vary substantially depending upon the specific changes or further guidance made and how the changes or guidance are implemented by the authorities.\nFor additional information, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A - Consolidated Results of Operations - U.S. Tax Law Changes.\nThe USA PATRIOT Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control and similar laws and regulations that apply to us may expose us to significant penalties. As a company that operates in approximately 70 countries and jurisdictions, AIG is subject to myriad regulations which govern items such as sanctions, bribery and anti-money laundering, for which failure to comply exposes us to significant penalties. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 requires companies to know certain information about their clients and to monitor their transactions for suspicious activities. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it unlawful for certain classes of persons and entities to make payments to foreign government officials to assist in obtaining or retaining business. Also, the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control administers regulations that restrict or prohibit dealings within U.S. jurisdictions involving certain organizations, individuals, countries, and financial products. The UK, the EU and other jurisdictions maintain similar laws and regulations. The laws and regulations of other jurisdictions may sometimes conflict with those of the U.S. Despite meaningful measures to ensure lawful conduct, which include training, audits and internal control policies and procedures, we may not always be able to prevent our employees or third parties acting on our behalf from violating these laws. As a result, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties as well as disgorgement. We could be required to make changes or enhancements to our compliance measures that could increase our costs, and we could be subject to other remedial actions. Violations of these laws or allegations of such violations could disrupt our operations, cause reputational harm, cause management distraction and result in a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nEstimates or assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements and modeled results used in various areas of our business may differ materially from actual experience. Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP), which requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. The accounting policies that we consider most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, and therefore may be viewed as critical accounting estimates, are described in Item 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates. These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. These estimates are based on judgment, current facts and circumstances, and, when applicable, internally developed models. Therefore, actual results could differ from these estimates, possibly in the near term, and could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, we employ models to price products, calculate reserves and value assets and execute hedging strategies, as well as to assess risk and determine capital requirements, among other uses. These models are complex and rely on estimates and projections that are inherently uncertain, may use incomplete, outdated or incorrect data or assumptions and may not operate as intended. To the extent that any of our operating practices and procedures do not accurately produce, or reproduce, data that we use to conduct any or all aspects of our business, such differences may negatively impact our business, reputation, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, modeling for man-made catastrophes, such as terrorism and cyber events is especially difficult and less reliable given such models are in the early stages of development and therefore, not widely adopted or available. In addition, actions taken by governments and monetary authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have affected and may affect the models we use to estimate volatility, among other items, which could adversely affect our business. For our Life and Retirement companies, examples of factors that could negatively impact our assumptions and estimates include significant changes in policyholder behavior assumptions such as lapses, surrenders and withdrawal rates as well as the amount of withdrawals, fund performance, equity market returns and volatility and interest rate levels. As our businesses continue to expand and evolve, the number and complexity of models we employ has grown, increasing our inherent exposure to error in the design, implementation or use of models, including the associated input data, controls and assumptions, and the controls we have in place to mitigate their risk may not be effective in all cases.\n48 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\nChanges in accounting principles and financial reporting requirements will impact our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which are periodically revised. Accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).\nThe FASB has revised the accounting standards for certain long-duration insurance contracts. The FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-12 - Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts, which has an effective date of January 1, 2023 and will significantly change the accounting measurements and disclosures for long-duration insurance contracts, which primarily relates to our life and annuity products as well as certain accident and health products, among others. The implementation of these changes has imposed and will continue to impose special demands on us in the areas of governance, employee training, internal controls and disclosure and affect how we manage our business, all of which will impact our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. In addition, implementation of the changes could impact our products, in-force management and asset liability management strategies and have other implications on operations and technology.\nThe adoption of this newly issued standard will, and other future accounting standards may impact our reported consolidated results of operations, liquidity and reported financial condition and may cause investors to perceive greater volatility in our financial results, negatively impacting our level of investor interest and investment.\nFor information regarding the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but are not yet required to be implemented, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIf our businesses do not perform well and/or their estimated fair values decline, we may be required to recognize an impairment of our goodwill or establish an additional valuation allowance against the deferred income tax assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Goodwill represents the excess of the amounts we paid to acquire subsidiaries and other businesses over the fair value of their net assets at the date of acquisition. We test goodwill at least annually for impairment and conduct interim qualitative assessments on a periodic basis. Impairment testing is performed based upon estimates of the fair value of the \u201creporting unit\u201d to which the goodwill relates. In 2021, for substantially all of the reporting units we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment of whether goodwill impairment may exist and, therefore, performed quantitative assessments that supported a conclusion that the fair value of all of the reporting units tested exceeded their book value. The fair value of the reporting unit is impacted by the performance of the business and could be adversely impacted if new business, customer retention, profitability or other drivers of performance differ from expectations, or upon the occurrence of certain events, including a significant and adverse change in regulations, legal factors, accounting standards or business climate, or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. Our goodwill balance was $4.1 billion at December 31, 2021. If it is determined that goodwill has been impaired, we must write down goodwill by the amount of the impairment, with a corresponding charge to net income (loss). These write-downs could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. For additional information on goodwill impairment, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates - Goodwill Impairment and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDeferred income tax represents the tax effect of the differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are assessed periodically by management to determine if they are realizable. As of December 31, 2021, we had net deferred tax assets, after valuation allowance, of $11.5 billion, related to federal, foreign, and state and local jurisdictions. The performance of the business, the geographic and legal entity source of our income, tax planning strategies, and the ability to generate future taxable income from a variety of sources and planning strategies including capital gains, is factored into management\u2019s determination. If, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized, then a valuation allowance must be established with a corresponding charge to net income, which such action we have taken from time to time. Such charges could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. For additional information on deferred tax assets, see Part II, Item 7. MD&A - Critical Accounting Estimates - Income Taxes and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAIG | 2021 Form 10-K 49\nITEM 1A | Risk Factors\nCOMPETITION and employees\nWe face intense competition in each of our business lines, and technological changes may present new and intensified challenges to our businesses. Our businesses operate in highly competitive environments, both domestically and overseas. Our principal competitors are other large multinational insurance organizations, as well as banks, investment banks and other nonbank financial institutions. The financial services industry, including the insurance industry, is highly competitive. Within the U.S., our General Insurance companies compete with other stock companies, specialty insurance organizations, mutual insurance companies and other underwriting organizations. Our Life and Retirement companies compete in the U.S. with life and retirement insurance companies and other participants in related financial services fields. Overseas, our subsidiaries compete for business with global insurance groups, local companies and the foreign insurance operations of large U.S. insurers.\nGeneral Insurance companies and Life and Retirement companies compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product pricing, and terms and conditions. Reductions of our credit ratings or IFS ratings or negative publicity may make it more difficult to compete to retain existing customers and to maintain our historical levels of business with existing customers, counterparties and distribution relationships. A decline in our position as to any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our profitability.\nTechnological advancements and innovation in the insurance industry, including those related to evolving customer preferences, the digitization of insurance products and services, acceleration of automated underwriting, and electronic processes present competitive risks. Technological advancements and innovation are occurring in distribution, underwriting, recordkeeping, advisory, claims and operations at a rapid pace, and that pace may increase, particularly as companies increasingly use data analytics and technology as part of their business strategy. Additional costs may also be incurred in order to implement changes to automate procedures critical to our distribution channels in order to increase flexibility of access to our services and products. While we seek opportunities to leverage technological advancements and innovation for our customers\u2019 benefit, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if external technological advancements or innovation, or the regulation of technological advancements or innovation, limit our ability to retain existing business, write new business at adequate rates or on appropriate terms, render our insurance products less suitable or impact our ability to adapt or deploy current products as quickly and effectively as our competitors.\nCompetition for employees in our industry is intense, and managing key employee succession is critical to our success. We may not be able to attract and retain the key employees and highly skilled people we need to support our business. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people, which may be difficult due to the intense competition in our industry for key employees with demonstrated ability. Recruiting and retention of talent has become especially challenging in the current employment market, fueled in part by changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we may experience higher than expected employee turnover and difficulty attracting new employees as a result of uncertainty from strategic actions and organizational and operational changes, including as a result of the planned separation of the Life and Retirement business from AIG. Losing any of our key people, including key sales or business personnel, could also have a material adverse effect on our operations given their skills, knowledge of our business, years of industry experience and the potential difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement employees. Additionally, we may face increased costs if, as a result of the competitive market and recent inflationary pressures, we must offer and pay a greater level of remuneration to attract or replace certain critical employees or hire contractors to fill highly skilled roles while vacant. Our business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining key employees.\nIn addition, we would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our senior management and other key employees. While we have succession plans and long-term compensation plans designed to retain our employees, our succession plans may not operate effectively and our compensation plans cannot guarantee that the services of these employees will continue to be available to us.\nEmployee error and misconduct may be difficult to detect and prevent and may result in significant losses. There have been a number of cases involving fraud or other misconduct by employees in the financial services industry in recent years and we are also exposed to the risk that employee misconduct could occur. Our human resources and compliance departments work collaboratively to monitor for fraud and conduct extensive training for employees. However, employee misconduct may still occur. Instances of fraud, illegal acts, errors, failure to document transactions properly or to obtain proper internal authorization, misuse of customer or proprietary information, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements or our internal policies may result in losses and/or reputational damage.\n50 AIG | 2021 Form 10-K", "PERMNO": 66800, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "AIG"}
