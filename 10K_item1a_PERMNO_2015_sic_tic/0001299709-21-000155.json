RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent in our business. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included in this report. In addition to the risks and uncertainties described below, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks disclosed in this section may have already materialized. The value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks, and you could lose all or part of your investment. This Annual Report on Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nRisks Relating to Macroeconomic Conditions\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect our performance.\nOur results of operations depend to a great extent on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest rates earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and investment securities, and the interest rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. We are exposed to interest rate risk because our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities do not react uniformly or concurrently to changes in interest rates, as the two have different time periods for adjustment and can be tied to different measures of rates. Interest rates are sensitive to factors that are beyond our control, including domestic and international economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, implemented through open market operations, the federal funds rate targets, the discount rate for banking borrowings and reserve requirements, affect prevailing interest rates. A material change in any of these policies could have a material impact on us or our customers (including borrowers), and therefore on our results of operations. After steadily increasing the target federal funds rate in 2018 and 2017, the Federal Reserve in 2019 decreased the target federal funds rate by 75 basis points, and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, decreased the target federal funds rate by an additional 150 basis points to a range of 0.0% to 0.25% as of March 31, 2020. Since March 2020, the Federal Reserve has maintained its federal funds rate target in a range of 0% to 0.25%.\nLoan originations and repayment rates tend to increase with declining interest rates and decrease with rising interest rates. On the deposit side, increasing interest rates generally lead to interest rate increases on our deposit accounts. We manage the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. However, a decrease in or continued low interest rates could cause borrowers to refinance higher rate loans at lower rates and under those circumstances, we may not be able to reinvest those prepayments in assets earning interest rates as high as the rates on those prepaid loans. Meanwhile, large, unanticipated, or rapid increase in market interest rates may have an adverse impact on our net interest income and could decrease our refinancing business and related fee income, and could cause an increase in delinquencies and non-performing loans and leases in our adjustable-rate loans. In addition, interest rate volatility can affect the value of our loans and leases, investments and other interest-rate sensitive assets and our ability to realize gains on the sale or resolution of these assets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage our interest rate risk.\nA significant economic downturn could result in increases in our level of non-performing loans and leases and/or reduce demand for our products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business and results of operations are affected by the financial markets and general economic conditions, including factors such as the level and volatility of interest rates, inflation, home prices, unemployment and under-employment\nlevels, bankruptcies, household income and consumer spending. While the national economy and most regions have improved since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we now operate in an uncertain economic environment primarily due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to a variety of other reasons for economic uncertainty, including but not limited to trade policies and tariffs, geopolitical tensions, concerns about inflation, the national debt, the stability of the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), including Britain\u2019s exit from the EU, volatile oil prices and emerging market crises. The risks associated with our business become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or slow growth. The continuation of recessionary conditions, high unemployment or potential negative events in the housing markets, including significant and continuing home price declines and increased delinquencies and foreclosures, would adversely affect our mortgage and construction loans and result in increased asset write-downs. While we are continuing to take steps to decrease and limit our exposure to problem loans, we nonetheless retain direct exposure to the residential and commercial real estate markets. Declines in real estate values, a prolonged economic downturn and an increase in unemployment levels may result in higher than expected loan and lease delinquencies and a decline in demand for our products and services. Furthermore, given our high concentration of loans secured by real estate in California, the Company remains specifically susceptible to a downturn in California\u2019s economy. These negative events may cause us to incur losses and may adversely affect our capital, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe weakness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to many different counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers-dealers, other commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other financial institutions. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by us or by other institutions and organizations. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nReplacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate may have an impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), a regulator of financial services firms in the United Kingdom, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. The FCA and the submitting LIBOR banks have indicated they will support the LIBOR indices through 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate. In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve to use a Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as an alternative to LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of overnight borrowings collateralized by Treasury securities that was selected by the Alternative Reference Rate Committee due to the depth and robustness of the U.S. Treasury repurchase market. Other financial services regulators and industry groups are evaluating the possible phase-out of LIBOR and the development of alternate reference rate indices or reference rates. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments.\nMany of our assets and liabilities are indexed to LIBOR. We are evaluating the potential impact of the possible replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, but are not able to predict whether LIBOR will cease to be available after 2021, whether the alternative rates the Federal Reserve proposes to publish will become market benchmarks in place of LIBOR, or what the impact of such a transition will have on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We continue to develop and implement plans to mitigate the risks associated with the expected discontinuation of LIBOR. The market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, any such transition could:\n\u2022adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, the revenue and expenses associated with, and the value of our floating-rate obligations, loans, deposits, derivatives, and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, or other securities or financial arrangements given LIBOR\u2019s role in determining market interest rates globally;\n\u2022prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of our preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate;\n\u2022require extensive changes to the contracts that govern these LIBOR-based products;\n\u2022result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based securities;\n\u2022require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition our risk management processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative pricing benchmark; and\n\u2022impact our pricing and interest rate risk models, our loan product structures, our funding costs, our valuation tools and result in increased compliance and operational costs.\nRisks Related to COVID-19 and the Federal Paycheck Protection Program\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 has impacted our business and could adversely affect our business activities, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to (i) increased unemployment and decreased consumer confidence and business generally, leading to an increased risk of delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures; (ii) sudden and significant declines, and significant increases in volatility, in financial markets; (iii) ratings downgrades, credit deterioration and defaults in many industries, including commercial real estate and multifamily; (iv) significant reductions in the targeted federal funds rate; and (v) heightened cybersecurity, information security and operational risks as a result of arrangements to work remotely. In addition, we also face an increased risk of client disputes, litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of COVID-19 on market and economic conditions and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions, including moratoria and other suspensions of collections, foreclosures, and related obligations.\nThe continued impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, is unknown at this time, and will depend on a number of evolving factors and future developments beyond our control and that we are unable to predict, including the duration, spread and severity of the pandemic; the nature, extent and effectiveness of containment measures; the timing of development and widespread availability of medical treatments or vaccines; the extent and duration of the effect on the economy, unemployment, consumer confidence and consumer and business spending; the impact and continued availability of monetary, fiscal and other economic policies and programs designed to provide economic assistance to individuals and small businesses; and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.\nAdditionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the financial markets and has resulted in a number of the Federal Reserve actions causing market interest rates to decline significantly, which could negatively impact our net interest income. A prolonged period of extremely volatile and unstable market conditions would likely increase our funding costs and negatively affect the effectiveness of our market risk mitigation strategies. Higher income volatility from changes in interest rates and spreads to benchmark indices could cause a loss of future net interest income and a decrease in current fair market values of our assets. Fluctuations in interest rates will impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our net income, operating results, or financial condition.\nAlthough the Company makes estimates of loan losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic as part of its evaluation of the allowance for credit losses, such estimates involve significant judgment and are made in the context of significant uncertainty as to the impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on the credit quality of our loan portfolio. Any increases in the allowance for credit losses will result in a decrease in net income.\nWe rely on many outside service providers that support our day-to-day operations including data processing and electronic communications, real estate appraisal, loan servicers and local and federal government agencies, offices and courthouses. If any of these service providers are unable to continue to provide us with these services, it could negatively impact our ability to serve our customers. Although we have a business continuity plan and other safeguards in place that are designed to provide for our continuing operation in case of potentially disruptive events, such as a global pandemic, there can be no guarantee that our plan will effectively address some or all of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe pandemic and containment measures have caused us to modify our strategic plans and business practices, and we may take further actions that we determine are in the best interests of our colleagues, customers and business partners. If we do not respond appropriately to the pandemic, or if customers or other stakeholders do not perceive our response to be adequate, we could suffer damage to our reputation and our brand, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe ultimate economic impacts to the Company of the COVID-19 pandemic are uncertain and difficult to predict and could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, a significant decrease in results of future operations may place a strain on the Bank's capital reserve ratios.\nOur bank has elected to participate as a lender in the Federal Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cPPP\u201d) and has accordingly become subject to risks applicable to lenders under the PPP.\nThe PPP loans made by the Bank under the federal CARES Act are guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) and, if the loan funds are used by the borrower for specific purposes as provided under the PPP, may be fully or partially forgiven by the SBA at which time, the Bank will receive funds related to the PPP loan forgiveness directly from the SBA. If the borrower under the PPP loan fails to qualify for loan forgiveness, we are at the heightened risk of holding these loans at unfavorable interest rates as compared to the loans to customers that we would have otherwise extended credit. Because of the brief time between the passing of the CARES Act and implementation of the PPP, some of the rules and guidance relating to the PPP evolved or were issued after lenders, including the Bank, began processing PPP applications. There was and continues to be uncertainty regarding some of the laws, rules and guidance relating to the PPP. If the SBA or other regulators determine that the Bank has not complied with all PPP laws, rules and guidance, we could be required to refund some or all of the fees related to PPP loans that we have earned or be subject to other regulatory enforcement action. Furthermore, in the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded or serviced by the Bank, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty or, if it has already made payment under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the Bank. In addition, since the commencement of the PPP, several banks have been subject to litigation regarding their processing of PPP loan applications. The Bank may be exposed to the risk of similar litigation and/or negative media attention, from both customers and non-customers that approached the Bank seeking PPP loans. PPP lenders, including the Bank, may also be subject to the risk of litigation in connection with other aspects of the PPP, including but not limited to borrowers seeking forgiveness of their loans. Any financial liability, litigation costs, or reputational damage caused by PPP related litigation or media attention could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Regulation of our Business\nChanges in laws, regulations or oversight or increased enforcement activities by regulatory agencies may increase our costs and adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to oversight, regulation and examination by federal and/or state governmental authorities under various laws, regulations and policies, which impose requirements or restrictions on our operations, capitalization, payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged and interest rates paid on deposits. We must also comply with federal anti-money laundering, bank secrecy, tax withholding and reporting, and various consumer protection statutes and regulations. A considerable amount of management time and resources is devoted to oversight of, and development and implementation of controls and procedures relating to, compliance with these laws, regulations and policies.\nThe laws, regulation and supervisory policies applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change. New or amended laws, rules and regulations could impact our operations, increase our capital requirements or substantially restrict our growth and adversely affect our ability to operate profitably by making compliance much more difficult or expensive, restricting our ability to originate or sell loans, or further restricting the amount of interest or other charges or fees earned on loans or other products. In addition, further regulation could increase the assessment rate we are required to pay to the FDIC, adversely affecting our earnings. It is very difficult to predict future changes in regulation or the competitive impact that any such changes would have on our business. Any new laws, rules and regulations including the recently effective California Privacy Act that could make compliance more difficult, expensive, costly to implement or may otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or growth prospects. Other changes to statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including subjecting us to additional costs, limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer, and increasing the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products.\nIn addition, the federal Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and similar laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain effective anti-money laundering programs and to file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports as appropriate. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (\u201cFinCEN\u201d), a bureau of the United States Department of Treasury, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the individual federal banking regulators, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and IRS. There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d). Federal and state bank regulators also have focused on compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering regulations. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approval to proceed with acquisitions and other strategic transactions,\nwhich could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have material adverse reputational consequences for us.\nOur failure to comply with current, or adapt to new or changing, laws, regulations or policies could result in enforcement actions and sanctions against us by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, along with corrective action plans required by regulatory agencies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the value of our common stock.\nOur broker-dealer and investment advisory businesses subjects us to regulatory risks.\nOur broker-dealer and investment advisory business subject us to regulation by the SEC, FINRA and other SROs and state securities commissions, among other regulatory bodies. Such violations could result in censure, penalties and fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, the restriction, suspension, or expulsion from the securities industry of the company or its officers or employees, or other similar adverse consequences, any of which could cause us to incur losses and adversely affect our capital, financial condition and results of operations. The SEC, FINRA and other SROs and state securities commissions, among other regulatory bodies, can censure, fine, issue cease-and-desist orders or suspend or expel a broker-dealer or any of its officers or employees. Clearing securities firms are subject to substantially more regulatory control and examination than introducing brokers that rely on others to perform clearing functions. Similarly, the attorney general of each state could bring legal action to ensure compliance with state securities laws, and regulatory agencies in foreign countries have similar authority. Our ability to comply with multiple laws and regulations pertaining to the securities industry depends in large part on our ability to establish and maintain an effective compliance function. The failure to establish and enforce reasonable compliance procedures, even if unintentional, could subject us to significant losses or disciplinary or other actions. Federally registered investment advisers are regulated and subject to examination by the SEC. In addition, the Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on our investment advisory business, including fiduciary duties, disclosure obligations, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, marketing restrictions and general anti-fraud prohibitions. Our failure to comply with the Advisers Act and associated rules and regulations of the SEC could subject us to enforcement proceedings and sanctions for violations, including censure or termination of SEC registration, litigation and reputational harm. In addition, our investment advisory business is subject to notice filings and the anti-fraud rules of state securities regulators. See \u201cRegulation of Securities Business\u201d.\nRecent changes to our size and structure will subject us to additional regulation, increased supervision and increased costs.\nThe Company is a savings and loan holding company that is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Reserve. As such, the Company is required to act as a financial \u201csource of strength\u201d for the Bank. The term \u201csource of financial strength\u201d is defined in the Dodd-Frank Act as the ability of a company to provide financial assistance to such insured depository institution in the event of the financial distress of such insured depository institution. Given the power provided to the federal banking agencies in this provision, it is possible that the Company could be required to serve as a source of financial strength for the Bank when we might not otherwise voluntarily choose to do so. In such event, if the Company did not hold or was unable to raise necessary capital, we could become subject to negative or burdensome regulatory conditions that could negatively impact our growth, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act imposes additional regulatory requirements on financial institutions with $10 billion or more in total assets. The Company has grown to hold total assets in excess of $10 billion beginning with the quarter ending March 31, 2019. As a result, we are now subject to the following additional requirements:\n\u2022supervision, examination and enforcement by the CFPB with respect to consumer financial protection laws;\n\u2022a modified methodology for calculating FDIC insurance assessments and potentially higher assessment rates as a result of institutions with $10 billion or more in assets being required to bear a greater portion of the cost of raising the reserve ratio to 1.35% as required by the Dodd-Frank Act;\n\u2022heightened compliance standards under the Volcker Rule; and\n\u2022enhanced supervision as a larger financial institution.\nThe imposition of these regulatory requirements and increased supervision may require additional commitment of financial resources to regulatory compliance and may increase our cost of operations.\nIn addition, under the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, institutions with $10 billion or more in assets are subject to a cap on the interchange fees that may be charged in certain electronic debit and prepaid card transactions, beginning July 1st of the following year in which the institution exceeds such size. The maximum permissible interchange fee for electronic debit transactions is the sum of 21 cents per transaction and five basis points multiplied by the value of the\ntransaction. In addition, an issuer may charge up to one cent on each transaction as a fraud prevention adjustment if the issuer meets certain fraud prevention standards.\nPolicies and regulations enacted by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau may negatively impact our residential mortgage loan business and compliance risk.\nOur consumer business, including our mortgage and deposit businesses, may be adversely affected by the policies enacted or regulations adopted by the CFPB, which, under the Dodd-Frank Act, has broad rule-making authority over consumer financial products and services. The CFPB is in the process of reshaping consumer financial protection laws through rule-making and enforcement against unfair, deceptive and abusive acts or practices. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority to administer and carry out the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to financial institutions that offer covered financial products and services to consumers. The CFPB has also been directed to write rules identifying practices or acts that are unfair, deceptive or abusive in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service, or the offering of a consumer financial product or service. The prohibition on \u201cabusive\u201d acts or practices is being clarified each year by CFPB enforcement actions and opinions from courts and administrative proceedings. In January 2014, a series of final rules issued by the CFPB to implement provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act related to mortgage origination and servicing went into effect and caused an increase in the cost of originating and servicing residential mortgage loans. While it is difficult to quantify any future increases in our regulatory compliance burden, the costs associated with regulatory compliance, including the need to hire additional compliance personnel, may continue to increase.\nRisks Relating to Mortgage Loans and Mortgage-Backed Securities\nDeclining real estate values, particularly in California, could reduce the value of our loan and lease portfolio and impair our profitability and financial condition.\nThe majority of the loans in our portfolio are secured by real estate. At June 30, 2021, approximately 72.4% of our mortgage portfolio was secured by real estate located in California. In recent years, there has been significant volatility in real estate values in California and in some cases the collateral for our real estate loans has become less valuable. If real estate values decrease or more of our borrowers experience financial difficulties, we will experience increased charge-offs, as the proceeds resulting from foreclosure may be significantly lower than the amounts outstanding on such loans. In addition, declining real estate values frequently accompany periods of economic downturn or recession and increasing unemployment, all of which can lead to lower demand for mortgage loans of the types we originate. A decline of real estate values or decline of the credit position of our borrowers in California would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our mortgage loans are unseasoned and defaults on such loans would harm our business.\nAt June 30, 2021, our multifamily residential loans were $2,470.5 million or 21.4% of our loan portfolio. The payment on such loans is typically dependent on the cash flows generated by the projects, which are affected by the supply and demand for multifamily residential units and commercial property within the relative market. If the market for multifamily residential units and commercial property experiences a decline in demand, multifamily and commercial borrowers may suffer losses on their projects and be unable to repay their loans. If residential housing values were to decline and nationwide unemployment continues to remain at historically elevated levels, we are likely to experience increases in the level of our non-performing loans and foreclosures in future periods.\nWe could recognize other-than-temporary impairment on securities held in our available-for-sale portfolio.\nWe analyze securities held in our portfolio for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. The process for determining whether impairment is other-than-temporary can involve difficult, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer, market conditions, and the value of any collateral underlying the security in order to assess the probability of receiving all contractual principal and interest payments on the security. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers and the performance of the underlying collateral, we may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairment in future periods reducing future earnings and capital levels.\nA decrease in the mortgage buying activity of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and MBS\u2019s guaranteed by Ginnie Mae or a failure by Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae, and Freddie Mac to satisfy their obligations with respect to their RMBS could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring the last three fiscal years we have sold approximately $2.6 billion of residential mortgage loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and into MBS\u2019s guaranteed by Ginnie Mae. As of June 30, 2021, approximately 12.8% of our securities portfolio consisted of RMBS issued or guaranteed by these GSEs. Since 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been in conservatorship, with its primary regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, acting as conservator. The United States government may enact structural changes to one or more of the GSEs, including privatization, consolidation and/or a reduction in the ability of GSEs to purchase mortgage loans or guarantee mortgage obligations. We cannot predict if, when or how the conservatorships will end, or what associated changes (if any) may be made to the structure, mandate or overall business practices of either of the GSEs. Accordingly, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the future of the GSEs, including whether they will continue to exist in their current form and whether they will continue to meet their obligations with respect to their RMBS. A substantial reduction in mortgage purchasing activity by the GSEs could result in a material decrease in the availability of residential mortgage loans and the number of qualified borrowers, which in turn may lead to increased volatility in the residential housing market, including a decrease in demand for residential housing and a corresponding drop in the value of real property that secures current residential mortgage loans, as well as a significant increase in interest rates. In a rising or higher interest rate environment, our originations of mortgage loans may decrease, which would result in a decrease in mortgage loan revenues and a corresponding decrease in non-interest income. Any decision to change the structure, mandate or overall business practices of the GSEs and/or the relationship among the GSEs, the government and the private mortgage loan markets, or any failure by the GSEs to satisfy their obligations with respect to their RMBS, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCommercial and industrial and commercial real estate loans may expose our company to greater financial and credit risk than other loans.\nOur commercial and industrial loans as well as our commercial real estate - mortgage portfolio were approximately $1,123.9 million and $3,180.5 million at June 30, 2021, comprising approximately 9.7% and 27.5% of our total loan portfolio, respectively. Commercial loans generally carry larger loan balances and can involve a greater degree of financial and credit risk than other loans. Any significant failure to pay on time by our customers could hurt our earnings. The increased financial and credit risk associated with these types of loans are a result of several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the size of loan balances, the effects of general economic conditions on income-producing properties and businesses and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans.\nRisks Relating to our Business Operations\nOur results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies, including with respect to our allowance for credit losses.\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. In addition, the FASB, SEC, bank regulators and outside independent auditors may revise their previous interpretations regarding existing accounting regulations and the application of these accounting standards. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. Such methods, estimates and judgments, include methodologies to value our securities, evaluate securities for other-than-temporary impairment and estimate our allowance for loan and lease losses. These methods, estimates and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods, estimates and judgments. Changes in those methods, estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (\u201cTopic 326\u201d) that replaces the current \u201cincurred loss\u201d model for recognizing credit losses with an \u201cexpected loss\u201d model referred to as the Current Expected Credit Loss (\u201cCECL\u201d) model for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Under the CECL standard, which we adopted on July 1, 2020, we are required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost, such as loans held for investment and held-to-maturity debt securities, at the net amount expected to be collected over the life of the loan. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on information about past events, including credit quality, our historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable macroeconomic forecasts that may affect the collectibility of the reported amount. This measurement takes place at the time the financial asset is first added to the balance sheet and at least quarterly thereafter. This differs significantly from the previous \u201cincurred loss\u201d model, which delayed recognition of estimated losses until it is probable a loss has been incurred and measured those losses over the estimated life of the loan rather than the loss emergence period. Certain CECL\nfactors are outside of our control and may be procyclical and/or create more volatility in the level of our allowance for credit losses which could impact our results of operations. CECL requires management judgment that is supported by new models and more data elements, including macroeconomic forecasts, than the previous allowance standard. This increases the complexity and associated risk, particularly in times of economic uncertainty or other unforeseen circumstances, which could impact our results of operations and may place stress on our internal controls over financial reporting.\nIf our allowance for credit losses, particularly in growing areas of lending such as commercial and industrial (\u201cC&I\u201d) is not sufficient to cover actual credit losses, our earnings, capital adequacy and overall financial condition may suffer materially.\nOur loans are generally secured by single family, multifamily and commercial real estate properties, each initially having a fair market value generally greater than the amount of the loan secured. Although our loans and leases are typically secured, the risk of default, generally due to a borrower\u2019s inability to make scheduled payments on his or her loan, is an inherent risk of the banking business. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses, we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectibility of our loan and lease portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers, the value of the real estate serving as collateral for the repayment of our loans and our loss history. Defaults by borrowers could result in losses that exceed our loan and lease loss reserves. We have originated or purchased many of our loans and leases recently, so we do not have sufficient repayment experience to be certain whether the established allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate. We may have to establish a larger allowance for loan and lease losses in the future if, in our judgment, it becomes necessary. Any increase in our allowance for loan and lease losses would increase our expenses and consequently may adversely affect our profitability, capital adequacy and overall financial condition.\nIn addition, we continue to increase our emphasis on non-residential lending, particularly in C&I lending, and these types of loans and leases are expected to comprise a larger portion of our originations and loan and lease portfolio in future periods. To the extent that we fail to adequately address the risks associated with C&I lending, we may experience increases in levels of non-performing loans and leases and be forced to take additional loan and lease loss reserves, which would adversely affect our net interest income and capital levels and reduce our profitability. For further information about our C&I lending business, please refer to \u201cBusiness - Asset Origination and Fee Income Businesses - Commercial Real Estate Secured and Commercial Lending.\u201d\nChanges in the value of goodwill and other intangible assets could reduce our earnings.\nThe Company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), which, in general, requires that goodwill not be amortized, but rather that it be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level using the two step approach. Testing for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets is performed annually and involves the identification of reporting units and the estimation of fair values. The estimation of fair values involves a high degree of judgment and subjectivity in the assumptions used. Changes in the local and national economy, the federal and state legislative and regulatory environments for financial institutions, the stock market, interest rates and other external factors (such as natural disasters or significant world events) may occur from time to time, often with great unpredictability, and may materially impact the fair value of publicly traded financial institutions and could result in an impairment charge at a future date.\nOur risk management processes and procedures may not be effective in mitigating our risks.\nWe have established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor and control material risks to which we are subject, including, for example, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, strategic risk and operational risk. If the models that we use to manage these risks are ineffective at predicting future losses or are otherwise inadequate, we may incur unexpected losses or otherwise be adversely affected. In addition, the information we use in managing our credit and other risks may be inaccurate or incomplete as a result of error or fraud, both of which may be difficult to detect and avoid. There may also be risks that exist, or that develop in the future, that we have not appropriately anticipated, identified or mitigated, including when processes are changed or new products and services are introduced. If our risk management framework does not effectively identify and control our risks, we could suffer unexpected losses or be adversely affected, and that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nHigher FDIC assessments could negatively impact profitability.\nFDIC insurance premiums are \u201crisk based\u201d. Accordingly, higher premiums are charged to banks that have lower capital ratios or higher risk profiles. As a result, a decrease in the Bank\u2019s capital ratios, or a negative evaluation by the FDIC, may increase the Bank\u2019s net funding cost and reduce its earnings.\nOur broker-dealer business subjects us to a variety of risks associated with the securities industry.\nOur broker-dealer business subjects us to a number of risks and challenges, including risks related to our ability to integrate the acquired operations and the associated internal controls and regulatory functions into our current operations; our ability to retain key personnel of the acquired operations; our ability to limit the outflow of acquired deposits and successfully retain and manage acquired assets; our ability to retain existing correspondents who may choose to perform their own clearing services, move their clearing business to one of our competitors or exit the business; our ability to attract new customers and generate new assets in areas not previously served; and the possible assumption of risks and liabilities related to litigation or regulatory proceedings involving the acquired operations.\nIn addition, the broker-dealer business may subject us to new risks related to the movement of equity prices. For example, if securities prices decline rapidly, the value of our collateral could fall below the amount of the indebtedness secured by these securities, and in rapidly appreciating markets, credit risk may increase due to short positions. The securities lending and securities trading and execution businesses also subject us to credit risk if a counterparty fails to perform or if collateral securing the counterparty\u2019s obligations is insufficient. In securities transactions generally, we will be subject to credit risk during the period between the execution of a trade and the settlement by the customer. Significant failures by our customers, including correspondents, or clients to honor their obligations, or increases in their rates of default, together with insufficient collateral and reserves, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, in March 2019, we suffered a $15.3 million bad debt expense due to a default by a correspondent customer arising from unauthorized securities trades by an employee of the customer.\nOur broker-dealer business is also subject to regulatory requirements and risks discussed above under \u201cOur broker-dealer and investment advisory businesses subjects to new regulatory risks\u201d. Our broker-dealer business also exposes us to other risks and uncertainties that are common in the securities industry, including intense competition, and potentially new areas and types of litigation including lawsuits based on allegations concerning our correspondents. For example, we allow our brokerage customers to engage in self-directed trading, and there has been an increase in regulatory enforcement and securities litigation against broker-dealers with self-directed trading platforms. These actions may become more common or frequent, particularly if there is a prolonged decrease in equity prices resulting in investor losses. Allegations of violations of securities laws or FINRA rules, even if not ultimately asserted or proved, could substantially impact our results of operations and lead to reputational harm.\nOur broker-dealer business is also subject to the net capital requirements of the SEC, FINRA and various self-regulatory organizations. These requirements typically specify the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also mandate that a significant part of its assets be kept in relatively liquid form. Failure to maintain the required net capital may subject a firm to limitation of its activities, including suspension or revocation of its registration by the SEC and suspension or expulsion by FINRA and other regulatory bodies, and ultimately may require its liquidation.\nOur investment advisory business subjects us to a variety of risks associated with investment performance and advisory services.\nOur investment advisory business is subject to regulatory requirements and risks discussed above under \u201cOur broker-dealer and investment advisory businesses subjects us to regulatory risks.\u201d The acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of E*TRADE Advisor Services (\u201cEAS\u201d), the registered investment advisor custody business of Morgan Stanley, acquired August 2, 2021, will also be subject to these regulatory requirements and risks.\nOur investment advisory business is and will be subject to various data privacy and cybersecurity laws designed to protect client and employee personally identifiable information. These laws and regulations are increasing in complexity and number which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for the business. The unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of client or employee personal, financial or other data could expose us to potential financial penalties and legal liability.\nAdditionally, poor investment returns and declines in client assets in our investment advisory business, due to either general market conditions or under-performance (relative to our competitors or to benchmarks) by investment products, may affect our ability to retain existing assets, prevent clients from transferring their assets out of products or their accounts, or inhibit our ability to attract new clients or additional assets from existing clients. Any such poor performance could adversely\naffect our investment advisory business and the advisory fees that we earn on client assets.\nOur acquisitions involve integration and other risks.\nFrom time to time we undertake acquisitions of assets, deposits, lines of business and other companies consistent with our operating and growth strategies. Acquisitions generally involve a number of risks and challenges, including our ability to integrate the acquired operations and the associated internal controls and regulatory functions into our current operations, our ability to retain key personnel of the acquired operations, our ability to limit the outflow of acquired deposits and successfully retain and manage acquired assets, our ability to attract new customers and generate new assets in areas not previously served, and the possible assumption of risks and liabilities related to litigation or regulatory proceedings involving the acquired operations. Additionally, no assurance can be given that the operation of acquisitions would not adversely affect our existing profitability, that we would be able to achieve results in the future similar to those achieved by the acquired operations, that we would be able to compete effectively in the markets served by the acquired operations, or that we would be able to manage any growth resulting from the transaction effectively. We also face the risk that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition may not be realized fully or at all, or within the time period expected.\nAs a public company, we face the risk of shareholder lawsuits and other related or unrelated litigation, particularly if we experience declines in the price of our common stock. We have been named as a party to purported class action and derivative lawsuits, and we may be named in additional litigation, all of which could require significant management time and attention and result in significant legal expenses.\nAs described in detail below in \u201cItem 3 - Legal Proceedings,\u201d putative class action lawsuits have been filed in the United States District Court, Southern District of California, alleging, among other things, that our Company, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer violated the federal securities laws by failing to disclose the wrongful conduct that is alleged by a former employee in a complaint, and that as a result the Company\u2019s statements regarding its internal controls, and portions of its financial statements, were false and misleading. Derivative lawsuits have also been filed against our management arising from the same events, alleging breach of fiduciary duty, mismanagement, abuse of control and unjust enrichment. Regardless of the merits, the expense of defending such litigation may have a substantial impact if our insurance carriers fail to cover the full cost of the litigation, and the time required to defend the actions could divert management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operations of our business, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. An unfavorable outcome in such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company and its management deny any wrongdoing and are vigorously defending the referenced lawsuits.\nWe may seek additional capital, but it may not be available when it is needed, which would limit our ability to execute our strategic plan. In addition, raising additional equity capital would dilute existing shareholders\u2019 equity interests and may cause our stock price to decline.\nWe are required by regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. In addition, we may elect to raise additional capital to support the growth of our business or to finance acquisitions, if any, or we may elect to raise additional capital for other reasons. We may seek to do so through the issuance of, among other things, our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock, which could dilute existing shareholders\u2019 interests in the Company.\nOur ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions, our financial performance and a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance on our ability to raise additional capital if needed or whether it can be raised on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed or on terms acceptable to us, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, raising equity capital will have a dilutive effect on the equity interests of our existing shareholders and may cause our stock price to decline.\nLiquidity and access to adequate funding cannot be assured.\nLiquidity is essential to our business and the inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, equity and debt offerings, or other sources could have a materially adverse effect on our liquidity. The Bank may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of its customers who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs. Company specific factors such as a decline in our credit rating, an increase in the cost of capital from financial capital markets, a decrease in business activity due to adverse regulatory action or other company specific event, or a decrease in depositor or investor confidence may impair our access to funding with acceptable terms adequate to finance our activities. General factors related to the financial services industry such as a severe disruption in financial markets, a decrease in industry expectations, or a decrease in business activity due to political or environmental events may impair our access to liquidity. We rely primarily upon deposits and FHLB advances. Our ability to attract deposits could be negatively impacted by a public perception of our financial prospects or by increased deposit rates available at troubled institutions suffering from shortfalls in liquidity. The FHLB advances and the FRBSF discount window are subject to regulation and other factors beyond our control. These factors may adversely affect the availability and pricing of advances to members such as the Bank. Selected sources of liquidity may become unavailable to the Bank if it were to no longer be considered \u201cwell-capitalized.\u201d\nOur inability to manage our growth or deploy assets profitably could harm our business and decrease our overall profitability, which may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur assets and deposit base have grown substantially in recent years, and we anticipate that we will continue to grow over time, perhaps significantly. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we will be required to manage multiple aspects of the business simultaneously, including among other things: (i) improve existing and implement new transaction processing, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls; (ii) maintain effective credit scoring and underwriting guidelines; (iii) maintain sufficient levels of regulatory capital; and (iv) expand our employee base and train and manage this growing employee base. In addition, acquiring other banks, asset pools or deposits may involve risks such as exposure to potential asset quality issues, disruption to our normal business activities and diversion of management\u2019s time and attention due to integration and conversion efforts. If we are unable to manage growth effectively or execute integration efforts properly, we may not be able to achieve the anticipated benefits of growth and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we may not be able to sustain past levels of profitability as we grow, and our past levels of profitability should not be considered a guarantee or indicator of future success. If we are not able to maintain our levels of profitability by deploying growth in our deposits in profitable assets or investments, our net interest margin and overall level of profitability will decrease and our stock price may decline.\nWe face strong competition for customers and may not succeed in implementing our business strategy.\nOur business strategy depends on our ability to remain competitive. There is strong competition for customers from existing banks and other types of financial institutions, including those that use the internet as a medium for banking transactions or as an advertising platform. Technology has also lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-bank, financial technology companies (\u201cFinTechs\u201d) to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks. FinTechs continue to emerge and compete with traditional financial institutions across a wide variety of products and services. Consumers have demonstrated a growing willingness to obtain banking services from FinTechs. As a result, our ability to remain competitive is increasingly dependent upon our ability to maintain critical technological capabilities, and to identify and develop new, value-added products for existing and future customers. Our competitors include large, publicly-traded, internet-based banks, as well as smaller internet-based banks; \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d banks, including those that have implemented websites to facilitate online banking; and traditional banking institutions such as thrifts, finance companies, credit unions and mortgage banks. Some of these competitors have been in business for a long time and have broader name recognition and a more established customer base. Most of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and personnel resources. In order to compete profitably, we may need to reduce the rates we offer on loans and leases and investments and increase the rates we offer on deposits, which actions may adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo remain competitive, we believe we must successfully implement our business strategy. Our success depends on, among other things:\n\u2022Having a large and increasing number of customers who use our bank for their banking needs;\n\u2022Our ability to attract, hire and retain key personnel as our business grows;\n\u2022Our ability to secure additional capital as needed;\n\u2022The relevance of our products and services to customer needs and demands and the rate at which we and our\ncompetitors introduce or modify new products and services;\n\u2022Our ability to offer products and services with fewer employees than competitors;\n\u2022The satisfaction of our customers with our customer service;\n\u2022Ease of use of our websites and smartphone applications;\n\u2022Our ability to provide a secure and stable technology platform for financial services that provides us with reliable and effective operational, financial and information systems; and\n\u2022Integration of our broker-dealer and registered investment-advisory businesses.\nIf we are unable to implement our business strategy, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and failing to maintain and enhance our brand could hurt our ability to maintain or expand our customer base.\nThe brand identities that we have developed will significantly contribute to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the \u201cAxos Bank\u201d brands (including our other trade styles and trade names) is critical to expanding our customer base. We believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the relatively low barriers to entry for our \u201cbrick and mortar\u201d competitors in the internet-based banking market. Our brands could be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including data privacy and security issues, service outages, product malfunctions , and trademark infringement. If our name change is not widely accepted by customers or proves to be less popular than anticipated, if we fail to maintain and enhance our brands generally, or if we incur excessive expenses in these efforts, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend on our ability to continue to provide high-quality products and services, which we may not do successfully.\nOur reputation and business could be damaged by negative publicity.\nReputational risk, including as a result of negative publicity, is inherent in our business. Negative publicity can result from actual or alleged conduct in a number of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, inadequate protection of customer data, illegal or unauthorized acts taken by third parties that supply products or services to us, and ethical behavior of our employees. Damage to our reputation could adversely impact our ability to attract new, and maintain existing, loan and deposit customers, employees and business relationships, and, particularly with respect to our broker-dealer and registered investment adviser businesses, could result in the imposition of new regulatory requirements, operational restrictions, enhanced supervision and/or civil money penalties. Such damage could also adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital. Any such damage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nWe regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, compliance monitoring activities and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well-designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, reputation and financial condition. In addition, if we identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting or are required to restate our financial statements, we could be required to implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures. We could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and potentially subject us to litigation. Any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting or restatement of our financial statements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, reputation, and financial condition.\nNatural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, civil unrest, public health issues, or other adverse external events could harm our business.\nOur Bank is based in San Diego, California, and approximately 72.4% of our mortgage loan portfolio was secured by real estate located in California at June 30, 2021. In addition, some of our computer systems that operate our internet websites and their back-up systems are located in San Diego, California. Historically, California has been vulnerable to natural disasters. Therefore, we are susceptible to the risks of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, wildfires, floods and mudslides, the nature and magnitude of which cannot be predicted and may be exacerbated by global climate change. Natural disasters could harm our operations directly through interference with communications, including the interruption or loss of our websites, which would prevent us from gathering deposits, originating loans and leases and processing and controlling our flow of business, as well as through the destruction of facilities and our operational, financial and management information systems. A natural disaster or recurring power outages may also impair the value of our largest class of assets, our loan and lease portfolio, which is comprised substantially of real estate loans. Losses from disasters for which borrowers are uninsured or under-insured may reduce borrowers\u2019 ability to repay mortgage loans. Natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, civil unrest, public health issues, or other adverse external events could each negatively impact our business operations or the stability of our deposit base, cause significant property damage, adversely impact the values of collateral securing our loans and/or interrupt our borrowers' abilities to conduct their business in a manner to support their debt obligations, which could result in losses and increased provisions for credit losses. Although we have implemented several back-up systems and protections (and maintain standard business interruption insurance), these measures may not protect us fully from the effects of a natural disaster, acts of war or terrorism, civil unrest, public health issues, or other adverse external events. The occurrence of natural disasters, particularly in California, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends in large part on the continuing efforts of a few individuals. If we are unable to retain these key personnel or attract, hire and retain others to oversee and manage our company, our business could suffer.\nOur success depends substantially on the skill and abilities of our senior management team, including our Chief Executive Officer and President, Gregory Garrabrants, our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew J. Micheletti, and other employees that perform multiple functions that might otherwise be performed by separate individuals at larger banks. The loss of the services of any of these individuals or other key employees, whether through termination of employment, disability or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our ability to grow and manage our growth depends on our ability to continue to identify, attract, hire, train, retain and motivate highly skilled executive, technical, managerial, sales, marketing, customer service and professional personnel. The implementation of our business plan and our future success will depend on such qualified personnel. Competition for such employees is intense, and there is a risk that we will not be able to successfully attract, assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel. If we fail to attract and retain the necessary personnel, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to our success.\nCompetition for qualified personnel is intense in many areas of the financial services industry. We endeavor to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees. The inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to risk of environmental liability with respect to properties to which we take title.\nIn the course of our business, we may foreclose and take title to real estate, including commercial real estate, and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to those properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. If we become subject to significant environmental liabilities, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nTechnology Risks in our Online Business\nWe depend on third-party service providers for our core banking and securities transactions technology, and interruptions in or terminations of their services could materially impair the quality of our services.\nWe rely substantially upon third-party service providers for our core banking technology and to protect us from bank system failures or disruptions, including with respect to securities technology at our clearing broker-dealer. This reliance may mean that we will not be able to resolve operational problems internally or on a timely basis, which could lead to customer dissatisfaction or long-term disruption of our operations. Our operations also depend upon our ability to replace a third-party service provider if it experiences difficulties that interrupt operations or if an essential third-party service terminates. If these service arrangements are terminated for any reason without an immediately available substitute arrangement, our operations may be severely interrupted or delayed. If such interruption or delay were to continue for a substantial period of time, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nPrivacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential customers from using our products and services.\nGenerally speaking, concerns have been expressed about whether internet-based products and services compromise the privacy of users and others. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure or security of personal information of our customers or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and results of operations. While we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause us to lose customers, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.\nMisconduct by employees could also result in fraudulent, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of clients or improper use of confidential personal information. The Company may not be able to prevent employee errors or misconduct, and the precautions the Company takes to detect this type of activity might not be effective in all cases. Employee errors or misconduct could subject the Company to civil claims for negligence or regulatory enforcement actions, including fines and restrictions on our business.\nIn addition, as nearly all of our products and services are internet-based, the amount of data we store for our customers on our servers (including personal information) has been increasing and will continue to increase. Any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the release of our customers\u2019 data could seriously limit the adoption of our products and services, as well as harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our business. We may also need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches. System enhancements and updates may also create risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems, the process of enhancing our layers of defense can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. In addition, addressing certain information security vulnerabilities, such as hardware-based vulnerabilities, may affect the performance of our information technology systems. The ability of our hardware and software providers to deliver patches and updates to mitigate vulnerabilities in a timely manner can introduce additional risks, particularly when a vulnerability is being actively exploited by threat actors.\nThe risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we add more customers and expand the number of internet-based products and services we offer.\nWe have risks of systems failure and disruptions to operations.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure utilized by us and others could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems. This is true of both our internally developed systems and the systems of our third-party service providers. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect computer equipment against damage from fire, power loss, telecommunication failure or similar catastrophic events.\nAny damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf our security measures are breached, or if our services are subject to cybersecurity attacks that degrade or deny the ability of customers to access our products and services, our products and services may be perceived as not being secure, customers may curtail or stop using our products and services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.\nOur products and services involve the storage and transmission of customers\u2019 proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation, and potential liability. We employ cybersecurity measures that are designed to prevent, detect, and respond to cyberattacks, including management-level engagement and corporate governance, formalized risk management, advanced technical controls, incident response planning, frequent vulnerability testing, vendor management, intrusion monitoring, security awareness program, and partnerships with the appropriate government and law enforcement agencies. These procedures cannot, however, assure that we will be fully protected from a cybersecurity incident. Our security measures may be breached due to the actions of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other outside parties, employee error, failure to follow security procedures, malfeasance, or otherwise and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or our customers\u2019 data. In addition, to access our products and services, our customers use personal computers, smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices that are beyond our control environment. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our customers\u2019 data. Other types of cybersecurity attacks may include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, denial-of-service attacks, ransomware or ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in the Company\u2019s systems or the systems of third parties. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, including those of our third-party vendors, such as hacking or identity theft, it could cause serious negative consequences, including significant disruption of our operations, misappropriation of confidential information, or damage to computers or systems, and may result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss and loss of confidence in our security measures. As a result, we could lose customers, suffer employee productivity losses, incur technology replacement and incident response costs, be subject to additional regulatory scrutiny, and be subject to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our customers. Internet access providers may be able to block, degrade or charge for access to our website, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of customers.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our customers to access the internet and our website. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies and mobile communications companies. Some of these providers have the ability to take measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of customer access to our products and services by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to access our website or by charging fees to us or our customers to provide access to our website. Such interference could result in a loss of existing customers and/or increased costs and could impair our ability to attract new customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are heavily reliant on technology, and a failure in effectively implementing technology initiatives or anticipating future technology needs or demands could adversely affect our business or financial results.\nWe depend on technology to deliver our products and services and to conduct our business and operations. To remain technologically competitive and operationally efficient, we invest in system upgrades, new solutions, and other technology initiatives. Many of these initiatives take a significant amount of time to develop and implement, are tied to critical systems, and require substantial financial, human, and other resources. Although we take steps to mitigate the risks and uncertainties associated with these initiatives, no assurance can be provided that they will be implemented on time, within budget, or without negative financial, operational, or customer impact or that, once implemented, they will perform as we or our customers expect. We also may not succeed in anticipating or keeping pace with future technology needs, the technology demands of customers, or the competitive landscape for technology. If we are not able to anticipate and keep pace with existing and future technology needs, our business, financial results, or reputation could be negatively impacted.\nRisks Associated with our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile.\nStock price volatility may make it more difficult for our stockholders to resell their common stock when desired. Our common stock price may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors that include the following:\n\u2022actual or expected variations in quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022operating and stock price performance of comparable companies, as deemed by investors;\n\u2022news reports relating to trends, concerns, and other issues in the financial services industry;\n\u2022perceptions in the marketplace about our company or competitors;\n\u2022new technology used, or services offered, by competitors;\n\u2022significant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments by, or involving, our Company or competitors;\n\u2022failure to integrate acquisitions or realize expected benefits from acquisitions;\n\u2022changes in government regulations; and\n\u2022geopolitical conditions, such as acts or threats of terrorism or military action.\nGeneral market fluctuations; industry factors; political conditions; and general economic conditions and events, such as economic slowdowns, recessions, interest rate changes, or credit loss trends, could also cause our common stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.\nYou may not receive dividends on our common stock.\nWe currently intend to retain any earnings to finance the growth and development of our business and common stock repurchases. Our board of directors has never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. Our ability to pay dividends, should our board of directors elect to do so, depends largely upon the ability of the Bank to declare and pay dividends to us. Future dividends will depend primarily upon our earnings, financial condition and need for funds, as well as government policies and regulations applicable to us and our bank that limit the amount that may be paid as dividends without prior approval. As a result, any payment of dividends in the future may depend on our ability to satisfy these regulatory restrictions and our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors.\nProvisions in our Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws and Delaware laws might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our Certification of Incorporation, by-laws and Delaware laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares of our common stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. These provisions include:\n\u2022supermajority voting provisions providing that certain sections of our Certificate of Incorporation and our By-laws may not be amended or repealed by our stockholders without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the voting power, and requiring the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of the voting power to remove a director or directors and only for cause;\n\u2022our classified Board of Directors, which may tend to discourage a third-party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us since the classification of our board of directors generally increases the difficulty of replacing a majority of directors;\n\u2022advance notice provisions requiring stockholders seeking to nominate candidates to be elected as directors at an annual meeting or to bring business before an annual meeting to comply with the written procedure specified in our By-laws;\n\u2022the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call special meetings;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to make, alter or repeal our by-laws;\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022the additional shares of authorized common stock and preferred stock available for issuance under our Certificate of Incorporation, which could be issued at such times, under such circumstances and with such terms and conditions as to impede a change in control.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless such transactions are approved by our board of directors. The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your common stock in an acquisition.", "PERMNO": 90634, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "AX"}
