RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nThe pandemic has impacted our business and that of many customers. The ultimate impact is uncertain and will depend on future action largely outside of our control.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted business and financial results for the Company and many of our customers. The ultimate outcome and duration will be heavily impacted by actions taken by governmental authorities. Previous steps taken include quarantines, travel bans, closing businesses and schools, fiscal and monetary stimulus and legislation intended to give financial aid and other relief. The pandemic and these steps have disrupted economic activity and increased uncertainty. A prolonged recovery period could result in additional economic stress or recession which could increase many of the risk factors identified below.\nBusiness interruption and increased unemployment due to the pandemic impacts credit risk for the Company as customers may experience cash flow interruptions which affect the ability to make scheduled loan payments. Collateral values may be negatively impacted due to increased property vacancy rates which could affect our ability to liquidate real estate collateral securing real estate loans and maintain loan origination volume. Regulatory changes designed to protect borrowers may delay in our taking certain remediation actions, such as foreclosure. The Bank has assisted customers experiencing COVID-19 related hardships by approving payment extensions and waiving or refunding certain banking fees. At December 31, 2020, the Bank had approved payment extensions on approximately $68.1 million of loans, primarily related to commercial real estate lending relationships. These payment extensions are generally for up to three months, but may extend for up to six months. At December 31, 2020, $65.3 million of those loans remain outstanding and $65.1 million have resumed payments. Furthermore, hotel and restaurant operators have been especially impacted by the pandemic and credits with those operators are being closely monitored. At December 31, 2020, hotel and restaurant loans totaled $12.1 million and $4.8 million, respectively. All except one credit totaling $164,000 is current as of that date.\nOperational risk has also been enhanced due to the pandemic. The Company faced and may continue to face a decrease in demand for certain products, reduced access to our branches by our customers, and disruptions in the operations of our venders. Restrictions on our staff\u2019s access to our facilities could limit our ability to serve our customers and effect operations. We have modified our operations with a portion of our staff working remotely from their homes in order to support continued operations. Additionally, customers are increasingly forced to work remotely. Those working from home may not have appropriately secured remote secured remote networks and may be more vulnerable to cyber-attacks or phishing schemes.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted interest rate risk as market rate volatility has increased. The Federal Reserve lowered the target range for federal funds rate to a range from 0% to 0.25% during 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Although the Federal Reserve's monetary policies to date have been accommodative and may benefit us to some degree by supporting economic activity of our customers, sudden shifts in the Federal Reserve's policies may impact our ability to grow and/or effectively manage interest-rate risk. While we continue to anticipate that our capital and liquidity positions will be sufficient, sustained adverse effects may impair these positions or prevent us from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory requirements.\nRisks Related To Our Business.\nAbove average interest rate risk associated with fixed-rate loans may have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nThe Bank\u2019s loan portfolio includes a significant amount of loans with fixed rates of interest. At December 31, 2020, $226.5 million, or 43.1% of the Bank\u2019s total loans receivable, had fixed interest rates all of which were held for investment. The Bank offers ARM loans and fixed-rate loans. Unlike ARM loans, fixed-rate loans carry the risk that, because they do not reprice to market interest rates, their yield may be insufficient to offset increases in the Bank\u2019s cost of funds during a rising interest rate environment. Accordingly, a material and prolonged increase in market interest rates could be expected to have a greater adverse effect on the Bank\u2019s net interest income compared to other institutions that hold a materially larger portion of their assets in ARM loans or fixed-rate loans that are originated for committed sale in the secondary market. For a discussion of the Bank\u2019s loan portfolio, see \u201cItem 1. Business- Lending Activities.\u201d\nHigher loan losses could require the Company to increase its allowance for loan losses through a charge to earnings.\nWhen we loan money we incur the risk that our borrowers do not repay their loans. We reserve for loan losses by establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The amount of this allowance is based on our assessment of loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio. The process for determining the amount of the allowance is critical to our financial results and condition. It requires subjective and complex judgments about the future, including forecasts of economic or market conditions that might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. We might underestimate the loan losses inherent in our loan portfolio and have loan losses in excess of the amount reserved. We might increase the allowance because of changing economic conditions. For example, in a rising interest rate environment, borrowers with adjustable-rate loans could see their payments increase. There may be a significant increase in the number of borrowers who are unable or unwilling to repay their loans, resulting in our charging off more loans and increasing our allowance. In addition, when real estate values decline, the potential severity of loss on a real estate-secured loan can increase significantly, especially in the case of loans with high combined loan-to-value ratios. Our allowance for loan losses at any particular date may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses. We may be required to increase our allowance for loan losses, thus reducing earnings.\nCommercial business lending may expose the Company to increased lending risks.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Bank\u2019s commercial business loan portfolio amounted to $82.3 million, or 15.7% of total loans. Excluding PPP loans, which are 100% guaranteed by the SBA, the Bank\u2019s commercial business loan portfolio amounted to $45.0 million, or 8.6% of total loans, at December 31, 2020. Subject to market conditions and other factors, the Bank intends to expand its commercial business lending activities within its primary market area. Commercial business lending is inherently riskier than residential mortgage lending. Although commercial business loans are often collateralized by equipment, inventory, accounts receivable or other business assets, the liquidation value of these assets in the event of a borrower default is often an insufficient source of repayment because accounts receivable may be uncollectible and inventories and equipment may be obsolete or of limited use, among other things. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Lending Activities-Commercial Business Loans.\u201d\nCommercial real estate lending may expose the Company to increased lending risks.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Bank\u2019s commercial real estate loan portfolio amounted to $135.1 million, or 25.7% of total loans. Commercial real estate lending is inherently riskier than residential mortgage lending. Because payments on loans secured by commercial properties often depend upon the successful operation and management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy, among other things. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Lending Activities-Commercial Real Estate Loans.\u201d\nDecreased residential mortgage origination volume and pricing decisions of competitors may adversely affect our profitability.\nThe Bank regularly originates and sells residential mortgage loans. Changes in interest rates, housing prices, applicable government regulations and pricing decisions by our loan competitors may adversely affect demand for our residential mortgage loan products and the revenue realized on the sale of loans and, ultimately, reduce our net income. New regulations, increased regulatory reviews, and/or changes in the structure of the secondary mortgage markets which we utilize to sell mortgage loans may increase costs and make it more difficult to operate a residential mortgage origination business. We recognized gains on the sale of loans of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This revenue could significantly decline in future periods if interest rates were to rise and the other risks highlighted in this paragraph were realized, which may adversely affect our profitability.\nOur information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security.\nThe Bank relies heavily on internal and outsourced digital technologies, communications, and information systems to conduct its business. As our reliance on technology systems increases, the potential risks of technology-related operation interruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan, or other systems or the occurrence of cyber incidents also increases. Cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events including (i) gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruptions; (ii) causing denial-of-service attacks on websites; or (iii) intelligence gathering and social engineering aimed at obtaining information. The occurrence of operational interruption, cyber incident, or a deficiency in the cyber security of our technology systems (internal or outsourced) could negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have policies and procedures expressly designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure, interruption, or security breach of our systems and maintain cyber security insurance. However, such policies, procedures, or insurance may prove insufficient to prevent, repel, or mitigate a cyber incident. Significant interruptions to our business from technology issues could result in expensive remediation efforts and distraction of management. During the year, we experienced certain immaterial cyber-attacks or breaches and continue to invest in security and controls to prevent and mitigate future incidents. Although we have not experienced any material losses related to a technology-related operational interruption or cyber-attack, there can be no assurance that such failures, interruptions, or security breaches will not occur in the future or, if they do occur, that the impact will not be substantial.\nThe occurrence of any failures, interruptions, or security breaches of our technology systems could damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of proprietary information, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or stock price. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may also be required to spend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nWe are subject to certain operational risks, including, but not limited to, customer or employee fraud and data processing system failures and errors.\nEmployee errors and employee and/or customer misconduct could subject us to financial losses or regulatory sanctions and seriously harm our reputation or financial performance. Misconduct by our employees could include, but is not limited to, hiding unauthorized activities from us, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of our customers or improper use of confidential information. It is not always possible to prevent employee errors and misconduct, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Employee errors could also subject us to financial claims for negligence.\nWe maintain a system of internal controls and insurance coverage to mitigate against operational risks, including data processing system failures and errors and customer or employee fraud. If our internal controls fail to prevent or detect an occurrence, or if any resulting loss is not insured or exceeds applicable insurance limits, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on outside third parties for processing and handling of our records and data.\nThe Bank relies on software developed by third party vendors to process various transactions. In some cases, we have contracted with third parties to run their proprietary software on our behalf. These systems include, but are not limited to, general ledger, payroll, employee benefits, and loan and deposit processing, and securities portfolio management. While we perform a review of controls instituted by the vendors over these programs in accordance with industry standards and perform our own testing of user controls, we must rely on the continued maintenance of these controls by the outside party, including safeguards over the security of customer data. In addition, we maintain backups of key processing output daily in the event of a failure on the part of any of these systems. Nonetheless, we may incur a temporary disruption in its ability to conduct our business or process our transactions or incur damage to our reputation if the third party vendor fails to adequately maintain internal controls or institute necessary changes to systems. Such disruption or breach of security may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Banking Industry.\nOur business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally.\nOur financial performance depends to a large extent on the business environment in our geographically concentrated five-county market area, the nearby suburban metropolitan Louisville market, the states of Indiana and Kentucky, and the U.S. as a whole. In particular, the current environment impacts the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans as well as the value of collateral securing those loans. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by economic growth, low unemployment, efficient capital markets, low inflation, high business and investor confidence, strong business earnings, and other factors. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity, or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment; natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors.\nIn the recent past, our market area, the suburban metropolitan Louisville market, the states of Indiana and Kentucky, and the U.S. as a whole experienced a downward economic cycle. Significant weakness in market conditions adversely impacted all aspects of the economy, including our business. In particular, dramatic declines in the housing market, with decreasing home prices and increasing delinquencies and foreclosures, negatively impacted the credit performance of construction loans, which resulted in significant write-downs of assets by many financial institutions. Business activity across a wide range of industries and regions was greatly reduced, and local governments and many businesses experienced serious difficulty due to the lack of consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets. In addition, unemployment increased significantly during that period, which further contributed to the adverse business environment for households and businesses.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a substantial effect on economic conditions in 2020. As previously discussed, there can be no assurance on the economic recovery, and future deterioration would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of recent difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry. Market stress could have a material adverse effect on the credit quality of our loans, and therefore, our financial condition and results of operations as well as other potential adverse impacts including:\n\u25cf\nThere could be an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies, lack of consumer confidence, increased market volatility, and widespread reduction of business activity generally.\n\u25cf\nThere could be an increase in write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, such as the Bank.\n\u25cf\nThere could be the loss of collateral value on commercial and real estate loans that are secured by real estate located in our market area. A further significant decline in real estate values in our market would mean that the collateral for many of our loans would provide less security. As a result, we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans because our ability to fully recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral would be diminished.\n\u25cf\nOur ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers could be impaired if the models and approaches it uses to select, manage, and underwrite credits become less predictive of future performance.\n\u25cf\nThe process we use to estimate losses inherent in our loan portfolio requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments. This process includes analysis of economic conditions and the impact of these economic conditions on borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans. The process could no longer be capable of accurate estimation and may, in turn, impact its reliability.\n\u25cf\nThe Bank could be required to pay significantly higher FDIC premiums in the future if losses further deplete the Deposit Insurance Fund.\n\u25cf\nWe could face increased competition due to intensified consolidation of the financial services industry. If current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access capital and on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFuture economic conditions in our market will depend on factors outside of our control such as political and market conditions, broad trends in industry and finance, legislative and regulatory changes, changes in government, military and fiscal policies and inflation.\nTurmoil in the financial markets could result in lower fair values for our investment securities.\nMajor disruptions in the capital markets experienced in recent years have adversely affected investor demand for all classes of securities, excluding U.S. Treasury securities, and resulted in volatility in the fair values of our investment securities. Significant prolonged reduced investor demand could manifest itself in lower fair values for these securities and may result in recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment (\u201cOTTI\u201d), which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMunicipal securities can also be impacted by the business environment of their geographic location. Although this type of security historically experienced extremely low default rates, municipal securities are subject to systemic risk since cash flows generally depend on (i) the ability of the issuing authority to levy and collect taxes or (ii) the ability of the issuer to charge for and collect payment for essential services rendered. If the issuer defaults on its payments, it may result in the recognition of OTTI or total loss, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nStrong competition within the Bank\u2019s market area could hurt the Company\u2019s profitability and growth.\nThe Bank faces intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. This competition has made it more difficult for it to make new loans and at times has forced it to offer higher deposit rates. Price competition for loans and deposits might result in the Bank earning less on loans and paying more on deposits, which would reduce net interest income. Competition also makes it more difficult to grow loans and deposits. Some of the institutions with which the Bank competes have substantially greater resources and lending limits than it has and may offer services that the Bank does not provide. Future competition will likely increase because of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. The Company\u2019s profitability depends upon the Bank\u2019s continued ability to compete successfully in its market area.\nWe are subject to federal regulations that seek to protect the Deposit Insurance Fund and the depositors and borrowers of the Bank, and our federal regulators may impose restrictions on our operations that are detrimental to holders of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the FRB, IDFI and FDIC, our primary regulators. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which an institution and its holding company may engage, and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of the Bank rather than for holders of the Company\u2019s common stock. Our regulators may subject us to supervisory and enforcement actions, such as the imposition of certain restrictions on our operations, requirements that we take remedial action, the classification of our assets and the determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses, that are aimed at protecting the insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of the Bank but that are detrimental to holders of the Company\u2019s common stock. Any change in our regulation or oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations.\nFinancial regulatory reform may have a material impact on the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act contains various provisions designed to enhance the regulation of depository institutions and prevent the recurrence of a financial crisis such as occurred in 2008 and 2009. These include provisions strengthening holding company capital requirements, requiring retention of a portion of the risk of securitized loans and regulating debit card interchange fees. The Dodd-Frank Act also created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to administer consumer protection and fair lending laws, a function that was formerly performed by the depository institution regulators. The full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on our business and operations will not be known for years until regulations implementing the statute are written and adopted. However, it is likely that the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will have an adverse impact on our operations, particularly through increased regulatory burden and compliance costs.\nAcquisitions and the addition of branch facilities may not produce revenue enhancements or cost savings at levels or within timeframes originally anticipated and may result in unforeseen integration difficulties and dilution to existing shareholder value.\nWe regularly explore opportunities to establish branch facilities and acquire other banks or financial institutions. New or acquired branch facilities and other facilities may not be profitable. We may not be able to correctly identify profitable locations for new branches. The costs to start up new branch facilities or to acquire existing branches, and the additional costs to operate these facilities, may increase our noninterest expense and decrease earnings in the short term. It may be difficult to adequately and profitably manage growth through the establishment of these branches. In addition, we can provide no assurance that these branch sites will successfully attract enough deposits to offset the expenses of operating these branch sites. Any new or acquired branches will be subject to regulatory approval, and there can be no assurance that we will succeed in securing such approvals.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Stock.\nAn investment in the Company\u2019s Common Stock is not an insured deposit.\nThe Company\u2019s common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund, or by any other public or private entity. Investment in the Company\u2019s common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any public company. As a result, if you acquire the Company\u2019s common stock, you could lose some or all of your investment.\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock may be volatile, which may result in losses for investors.\nGeneral market price declines or market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of the Company\u2019s common stock. In addition, the following factors may cause the market price for shares of the Company\u2019s common stock to fluctuate:\n\u25cf\nannouncements of developments related to the Company\u2019s business;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in the Company\u2019s results of operations;\n\u25cf\nsales or purchases of substantial amounts of the Company\u2019s securities in the marketplace;\n\u25cf\ngeneral conditions in the Company\u2019s banking niche or the worldwide economy;\n\u25cf\na shortfall or excess in revenues or earnings compared to securities analysts\u2019 expectations;\n\u25cf\nchanges in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections; and\n\u25cf\nthe Company\u2019s announcement of new acquisitions or other projects.\nThe trading volume in the Company\u2019s common stock is less than that of other larger financial services institutions.\nAlthough the Company\u2019s common stock is listed for trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market, the trading volume in its common stock may be less than that of other, larger financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity, and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of the Company\u2019s common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which the Company has no control. During any period of lower trading volume of the Company\u2019s common stock, significant sales of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, or the expectation of these sales could cause the Company\u2019s common stock price to fall.\nThe Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation, Indiana law, and certain banking laws may have an anti-takeover effect.\nProvisions of the Company\u2019s Articles of Incorporation, the Indiana Business Corporation Law and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Company, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial by the Company\u2019s shareholders. The combination of these provisions could have the effect of inhibiting a non-negotiated merger or other business combination, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company may issue additional securities, which could dilute the ownership percentage of holders of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company may issue additional securities to, among other reasons, raise additional capital or finance acquisitions, and, if it does, the ownership percentage of holders of the Company\u2019s common stock could be diluted potentially materially.\nWe may not be able to pay dividends in the future in accordance with past practice.\nThe Company has traditionally paid a quarterly dividend to common shareholders. The payment of dividends is subject to legal and regulatory restrictions. Any payment of dividends in the future will depend, in large part, on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by the Company\u2019s Board of Directors. The Board may, at its discretion, further reduce or eliminate dividends or change its dividend policy in the future.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe continually encounter technological change.\nThe banking and financial services industry continually undergoes technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to better meeting customer needs, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that enhance customer convenience and that create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technological improvements, and we may not effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or do so as quickly as our competitors, which could reduce our ability to effectively compete. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nThe Bank\u2019s success depends on its ability to attract and retain skilled people. Competition for the best people in most activities in which we engage can be intense, and we may not be able to hire people or retain them. The unexpected loss of services of certain of our skilled personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills, knowledge of our market, years of industry experience, customer relationships, and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nLoss of key employees may disrupt relationships with certain customers.\nOur customer relationships are critical to the success of our business, and loss of key employees with significant customer relationships may lead to the loss of business if the customers were to follow that employee to a competitor. While we believe our relationships with key personnel are strong, we cannot guarantee that all of our key personnel will remain with the organization, which could result in the loss of some of our customers and could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 86573, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FCAP"}
