You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before purchasing our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could fall, and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR DRUG BUSINESS\nWe may not be successful in commercializing Dialysate Triferic, which will impede our development and growth and may limit our long-term prospects.\nIn June 2018, we announced plans to commence initial steps to prepare for the commercial launch of Dialysate Triferic without waiting to receive separate reimbursement status. While we have commenced commercialization of Dialysate Triferic as of the date of the report, we will need to add to our sales and marketing infrastructure in order to successfully commercialize Dialysate Triferic. We do not know whether we will be able to successfully implement our commercialization strategy for Dialysate Triferic or whether our new business strategy will ultimately be successful. We may not be able to convince potential customers\nthat the safety, efficacy, clinical utility of Dialysate Triferic are compelling enough to effectuate a change in their clinical practice, including potential operational changes required to adopt Dialysate Triferic. Additionally, the initial demand for the product will impact our ability to utilize existing product inventory prior to expiration. If we commercialize Dialysate Triferic slower than currently anticipated, we may need to write off additional inventory reserves, which could result in material accounting charges in future periods. Additionally, the expiration of existing product inventory could limit the total inventory available for commercial sales while we ramp-up commercial production and attempt to manage production in light of anticipated demand.\nIn assessing our ability to meet these challenges, a potential investor should take into account our recent management turnover, limited cash position, limited sales and marketing personnel and their limited commercialization experience, the competitive conditions existing in our industry and general economic conditions. Our future success is largely dependent on our ability to successfully implement our Dialysate Triferic commercialization business strategy. Our revenues may be adversely affected if we fail to implement our Dialysate Triferic commercialization business strategy.\nOur near-term success depends substantially on the commercialization of Dialysate Triferic and, if approved, I.V. Triferic. Although Dialysate Triferic has been approved by the FDA, and the FDA may approve I.V. Triferic, we may not be able to commercialize either product successfully.\nDialysate Triferic launched commercially in the United States in May 2019 and I.V. Triferic has a PDUFA date of March 28, 2020; however, it is possible that either version of Triferic will not gain market acceptance and that we will not be successful in the commercialization of these products. We do not know whether we will be able to successfully implement our commercialization strategy for Dialysate Triferic and I.V. Triferic, if approved, or whether our new business strategy will ultimately be successful.\nBoth formulations of Triferic will be reimbursed \u201cwithin the bundle,\u201d which means that dialysis providers will not receive any additional amount of reimbursement from Medicare or Medicaid to compensate them for the cost of purchasing and administering Triferic. This reimbursement status may result in a slower rate of commercial adoption, as we must work to show dialysis providers that improved patient outcomes, the reduction of utilization in other therapies and the resulting savings offset the costs associated with Triferic. Additionally, Triferic competes against current anemia therapies (including intravenous iron and the ESA class of drugs) and possibly other future products. Additionally, it may be difficult to gain market acceptance from dialysis chains, anemia managers and nephrologists and such acceptance may be slower than expected, if at all.\nMarket acceptance will depend on a number of factors, such as demonstration of Dialysate Triferic\u2019s safety and efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and advantages over existing products. Other factors that may impact the commercial success and ultimate profitability of Triferic include:\n\u2022\nthe rate of adoption of Dialysate Triferic and I.V. Triferic relative to the shelf life of the existing inventory that we have on hand and whether we can sell our existing inventory before it expires;\n\u2022\nour ability to manage inventory available for commercial sale;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of our marketing, sales and distribution strategies and operations for development and commercialization;\n\u2022\nthe impact of Dialysate Triferic and I.V. Triferic on established customer protocols, formularies and operational practices;\n\u2022\nreimbursement of either formulation of Triferic by government and commercial payors;\n\u2022\nour ability to execute our marketing strategy without significant additional expenditures;\n\u2022\nour competitors\u2019 activities, including aggressive marketing and pricing practices and other tactics to retain their market share;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully assert our patents against potential competitors who may seek to introduce generic versions of either formulation of Triferic;\n\u2022\nour ability to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements applicable to either formulation of Triferic and the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping applicable to Triferic;\n\u2022\nthe impact of certain royalties related to our sale of either formulation of Triferic paid by us based on the profitability of either formulation of Triferic;\n\u2022\nour ability to avoid third party patent interference or patent infringement claims;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain a continued acceptable safety profile of either formulation of Triferic;\n\u2022\nthe discovery of previously unknown problems with either formulation of Triferic or with any third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nthe ability to successfully manufacture commercial product to enable a launch of I.V. Triferic in 2020; and\n\u2022\nthe ability to successfully complete our I.V. Triferic commercialization planning thereby enabling a launch of Triferic I.V. in 2020.\nAn adverse development with respect to any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and market either formulation of Triferic. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate meaningful and sustained revenues through the sale of either formulation of Triferic. If we are not successful in commercializing either formulation of Triferic, or are significantly delayed in doing so, our entire investment in Triferic may be of no value, our inventory of finished product may expire or become obsolete (resulting in write-offs of such inventory), our licensing rights could be materially adversely affected and the price of our common stock could substantially decline. Even if we are successful in commercializing either formulation of Triferic, since the market is highly concentrated with two significant suppliers, our continued success may depend on adoption of Dialysate Triferic by the limited number of existing dialysis providers.\nIf we are unable to develop and maintain sales, marketing and distribution capabilities to sell and market Dialysate Triferic or any other products we may develop, our product sales may be hindered.\nWe are still in the process of establishing an internal sales organization for the sale, marketing and distribution of Dialysate Triferic, as well as I.V. Triferic (if approved). In order to successfully commercialize Dialysate Triferic, I.V. Triferic and future product candidates, we must establish and/or increase our sales, marketing, distribution and other non-technical capabilities. The development of a sales organization to market Dialysate Triferic, I.V. Triferic, or any future product candidate, is expensive and time-consuming, and we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully develop this capacity or that this function will execute as expected. If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we may not be able to generate product revenue and our business and results of operations will suffer.\nIf we are unable to use our Dialysate Triferic inventory before its shelf life expires, we will likely have to write-off such inventory, which will likely have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nGiven that we have recently commenced commercialization of Dialysate Triferic, we cannot predict the rate of future sales and usage of the drug. As of December 31, 2019, we had a gross inventory balance for Dialysate Triferic of $3.5 million, including approximately $2.9 million in Dialysate Triferic\u2019s active pharmaceutical ingredient and $0.6 million in finished goods inventory. Of this amount, we had reserved $2.8 million related to our Dialysate Triferic finished goods and active pharmaceutical ingredient inventory. As a result of this reserve, our total Dialysate Triferic inventory had a net book value of $0.7 million as of December 31, 2019. The Dialysate Triferic inventory has an initial shelf life ranging from one to three years. If we are unable to utilize some or all of our Dialysate Triferic inventory before its shelf life expires, some or all of our investment in Dialysate Triferic inventory may not be salable. This would reduce the inventory we have available for sale and require us to reserve for the reduction in value, which would likely require us to write-off the value of such inventory. We may also need to reserve for inventory that we estimate will not be sold before such inventory expires. Any such inventory reserve could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nIn order to realize the full potential value for our Triferic franchise, we will need to obtain regulatory approval of I.V. Triferic. Although we believe that we currently have sufficient data to support the approval of I.V. Triferic in the United States, there is no guarantee of success.\nIn order to expand and realize the full potential value of our Triferic franchise, we will need to obtain approval of I.V. Triferic by the FDA, as well as foreign regulators, such as the EMA. We believe that the market opportunity for I.V. Triferic is greater than for Dialysate Triferic. Although we believe that we have sufficient data to support the approval of I.V. Triferic, it is possible that the FDA could request additional data regarding the product or the manufacturing process. Accordingly, there is no guarantee the FDA or any other foreign regulator will approve I.V. Triferic. In reviewing our planned NDA submission for I.V.\nTriferic, the FDA may find deficiencies that raise safety or efficacy concerns or may otherwise require additional clinical testing or impose other requirements, which could significantly delay approval or result in us not receiving approval at all. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from testing could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Furthermore, at the time of FDA approval of our NDA for Dialysate Triferic, we agreed to perform a post-approval clinical study of Dialysate Triferic in a pediatric population. If we do not timely satisfy our post-approval study requirements, it is possible that the FDA could decline to act on future Dialysate Triferic or I.V. Triferic filings. If approval is not granted for I.V. Triferic on the timeframe we expect, or if it is not approved at all, the value of our Triferic franchise would be severely limited.\nI.V. Triferic, if approved, is ineligible for add-on reimbursement status, the commercial opportunity for the drug product in the United States could be limited.\nOn October 31, 2019, CMS issued a final rule to update payment policies and rates under the ESRD Prospective Payment System for renal dialysis services to beneficiaries on or after January 1, 2020. (\"2020 Final Rule\"). The 2020 Final Rule included certain revisions to the eligibility requirements for the CMS TDAPA program. Under the revised TDAPA rules, ESRD drugs approved by the FDA under NDA Type 3 (or certain combination types) are ineligible for TDAPA effective as of January 1, 2020. As previously disclosed, we have filed an NDA for I.V. Triferic. The FDA has informed us that the NDA for I.V. Triferic will be classified as a Type 3 NDA. As a result, the Company believes that I.V Triferic will not be eligible for TDAPA. This could significantly limit the overall commercial opportunity in the United States for I.V. Triferic should the FDA approve the drug.\nOur ability to market Dialysate Triferic is limited by the FDA to those specific indications and conditions for which clinical safety and efficacy have been demonstrated.\nThe FDA must approve any new indication for an approved product. Dialysate Triferic is approved by the FDA for use in adult patients receiving hemodialysis treatments and has not yet been approved for other indications or for other claims for which we may seek approval, such as ESA-sparing. We are not able to promote Dialysate Triferic or encourage our customers to use Dialysate Triferic for purposes other than the indications of use that have been specifically approved by the FDA as safe and effective. If we are not able to obtain FDA approval for additional indications for Dialysate Triferic or secure an expanded product label, our ability to fully market Dialysate Triferic on the basis of cost savings or improved patient outcomes may be limited, which would limit our ability to take full advantage of Dialysate Triferic\u2019s market opportunity.\nBecause we may be unable to complete our development, manufacturing and commercialization of our products, we could face significant harm to our business plans, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nCommercializing Dialysate Triferic depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nfurther product and manufacturing process development;\n\u2022\ncompletion, refinement and management of our supply chain and distribution channels;\n\u2022\nmeeting regulatory requirements for clinical information;\n\u2022\ndifferentiation of our products from competitive products, including those in development by other companies;\n\u2022\ndemonstration of efficiencies that will make our products attractively priced; and\n\u2022\ndevelopment of an adequate sales force and sales channels necessary to distribute our products and achieve our desired revenue goals.\nWe cannot commercialize I.V. Triferic unless and until we receive FDA approval of our NDA for this product candidate, which was submitted in May 2019. Even if the FDA approves I.V. Triferic for commercialization, under the 2020 Final Rule published by CMS in October 2019, it appears that I.V. Triferic is not be eligible for add-on reimbursement, meaning I.V. Triferic would be required to be sold within the bundled payment for dialysis treatment. This could significantly limit the overall commercial opportunity in the United States for I.V. Triferic.\nWe cannot assure investors that the strategies we intend to employ will enable us to support the manufacture, distribution and selling of Dialysate Triferic or I.V. Triferic (if approved). If we are unable to implement the necessary steps of our business plan, our prospects, results of operations and financial condition will suffer.\nIf we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate protection for our data, intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our business may be harmed.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our drug products and product candidates. The degree of patent protection that will be afforded to our drug products and processes in the United States and in other important markets remains uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of protection afforded to us by the patent offices, courts, administrative bodies and lawmakers in the relevant jurisdictions. We can provide no assurance that we will successfully obtain or preserve patent protection for the technologies incorporated into our drug products and processes, or that the protection obtained will be of sufficient breadth and degree to protect our commercial interests in all countries where we conduct business. If we cannot prevent others from exploiting our inventions, we will not derive the benefit from them that we currently expect.\nWhile we have an issued patent in the United States and certain other major markets, including Europe and Japan, that covers the I.V. and Dialysate formulations of Triferic, these patents expire in 2029. The previously issued foundational composition-of-matters patents for Triferic expired in 2016. In light of the current patent protection that we have for Triferic, it is possible that a competitor could seek to manufacture a generic version of Triferic using product specifications and manufacturing methods that do not infringe our issued patent. Further, it is possible that a competitor could seek to invalidate our issued Triferic patent.\nWe also rely on regulatory exclusivity for protection of our drug products, which includes regulatory data protection and market protection. Implementation and enforcement of regulatory exclusivity varies widely from country to country. Failure to qualify for regulatory exclusivity, or failure to obtain or maintain the necessary extent or duration of such protections for our drug products could affect our revenues, our decision on whether to market our drug products in a particular country and could otherwise have an adverse impact on our results of operations. In the United States, our regulatory exclusivity for Dialysate Triferic as a new chemical entity started with FDA approval of the product. Because of the delay between approval and the commercial launch of Triferic, our regulatory exclusivity has expired and we must rely on patent protection for the long-term protection of our Triferic franchise.\nLitigation, interferences, oppositions, inter partes reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are, have been and may in the future be necessary to determine the validity and scope of certain of our proprietary rights. Such proceedings may also be necessary to determine the validity, scope or non-infringement of certain patent rights claimed by third parties to be pertinent to the manufacture, use or sale of our drug products. We may also face challenges to our patent and regulatory protections covering our drug products by third parties, including manufacturers of generics that may choose to launch their products before the expiration of our patent or regulatory exclusivity.\nLitigation, interference, oppositions, inter partes reviews, administrative challenges or other similar types of proceedings are unpredictable and may be protracted, expensive and distracting to management. The outcome of such proceedings could adversely affect the validity and scope of our patent or other proprietary rights, hinder our ability to manufacture and market our drug products, require us to seek a license for the infringed product or technology or result in the assessment of significant monetary damages against us that may exceed amounts, if any, accrued in our financial statements. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or a failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing or selling our drug products. Furthermore, payments under any licenses that we are able to obtain would reduce our profits derived from the covered products and services.\nWe depend on third parties to manufacture Triferic. If these organizations are unable or unwilling to manufacture our drug products, or if these organizations fail to comply with FDA or other applicable regulations or otherwise fail to meet our requirements, our business will be harmed.\nWe rely on CMOs to manufacture Triferic. If a CMO is unable to manufacture Triferic in sufficient quantities and on a consistent basis, or if it becomes unwilling to produce Triferic for us, we may not be able to supply our customers in a timely manner. For I.V. Triferic and our liquid formulation of Dialysate Triferic, we have a single-source finished goods supplier and do not have a long-term supply contract. If we were to experience a supply disruption, it could take an extended period of time to find and qualify an alternate supplier. The manufacturing facilities and processes used by our CMOs must be approved by the FDA and foreign regulators, where applicable, before the drug products manufactured by such CMOs can be sold. After approval, CMOs must meet certain ongoing regulatory requirements for product testing and stability of our commercially marketed products. We do not control the manufacturing processes of our CMOs and depend on them to comply with current good manufacturing practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d), and obtain and maintain regulatory approval. If approval for a CMO is not received or ongoing testing does not continue to meet approved standards and approval is withdrawn, the CMO\u2019s production would be delayed or suspended, which could adversely affect our Triferic commercialization efforts. If that was to happen, we may be forced to find another capable CMO or shift production to another CMO that is already approved and under contract with us. Any such circumstance could\nsignificantly hamper our ability to supply our customers with our drug products in a timely manner, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe rely on third party suppliers for raw materials and packaging components of our drug products. We may not be able to obtain the raw materials and proper components we need, or the cost of the materials or components may be higher than expected, any of which could impair our production or commercialization of drug products and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nWe may not be able to obtain the raw materials or packaging components we need, or the price of such materials or components may rise significantly, for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\na business interruption, including a force majeure, cyber-attack or labor strike at a supplier\u037e\n\u2022\nregulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others against a supplier, including delays in receiving necessary approvals\u037e\n\u2022\nfailure of a supplier to comply with cGMP standards, which could result in quality or product failures, adulteration, contamination and/or recall\u037e\n\u2022\nadverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting a supplier;\n\u2022\ntermination or disagreement over the terms and conditions of the supply contract by a supplier;\n\u2022\nunexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials or packaging components; and\n\u2022\nunexpected increases in our product demand.\nSome of the suppliers for our raw materials or packaging components are single-source suppliers. Finding an alternative source can be expensive and take a substantial amount of time, especially when regulatory approval is required to qualify the supplier. If we are unable to obtain our raw materials and packaging components and are not able to establish alternative supply sources, or if the prices for such items increase substantially, our CMOs may not be able to produce the desired quantities of our drug products and our expected gross profit margins may be materially adversely affected.\nAn epidemic of the coronavirus disease is ongoing in China and other parts of the world and may result in significant disruptions to our and our partners\u2019 clinical trials, supply chain and product demand, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAn epidemic of the coronavirus disease is ongoing in China and other parts of the world. As the outbreak is still evolving, much of its impact remains unknown. As of this filing, it is impossible to predict the effect and potential spread of the coronavirus disease in China and globally.\nWanbang is our commercialization partner for both Dialysate Triferic and I.V. Triferic in China. We currently expect Wanbang to initiate additional clinical studies during 2020 that are necessary to support a submission for regulatory approval in China. We also expect to begin enrollment in a pediatric clinical study in 2020. However, the coronavirus disease may result in significant delays or disruptions for such clinical trials, which could affect the regulatory approval process. If the patients involved with these clinical trials become infected with the coronavirus disease, we may have more adverse events and deaths in our clinical trials as a result. We may also face difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials if the patient populations that are eligible for our clinical trials are impacted by the coronavirus disease.\nAdditionally, if our clinical trial patients are unable to travel to our clinical trial sites as a result of quarantines or other restrictions resulting from the coronavirus disease, we may experience higher drop-out rates or delays in our clinical trials. We may also face decreased demand if our dialysis patients are unable to travel to dialysis clinics.\nThe severity of the coronavirus disease could also make access to our existing supply chain difficult or impossible and could materially impact our business. Any one or a combination of these events could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining foreign regulatory approvals or in arranging out-licensing partners capable of obtaining the approvals needed to effectively commercialize Dialysate Triferic, I.V. Triferic or any other drug product candidates outside\nof the United States. Even if we, or our partners, are successful in obtaining the required regulatory approvals, we may not be effective at marketing our drug products in certain markets or at all.\nThe regulatory procedures for obtaining marketing approval of drug products and product candidates, including Dialysate Triferic and I.V. Triferic, outside the United States vary from country to country and such approvals can be difficult to obtain. Regulatory approval in foreign countries may require additional clinical testing, such is the case with Triferic and our ability to file for regulatory approval in Europe. These tests may be expensive and time consuming and there can be no assurance as to our ability to achieve a positive result, even if we have had positive clinical trial results in the past. Even after foreign approvals are obtained, further delays may be encountered before products may be marketed. Many countries require additional government approval for price reimbursement under national health insurance systems.\nEven if we obtain the necessary foreign approval in a particular market, we do not have expertise selling and marketing on an international level and, therefore, may not be successful in realizing commercial value from our drug products. Thus, our strategy is to out-license the rights to our drug products in markets outside the United States to partners who we believe will have the necessary resources and expertise to obtain regulatory approval and ultimately commercialize our out-licensed drug products. However, we may not be successful in finding new partners who will be willing to invest in our drug products outside the United States and even if we are able to find new partners, they may not be able to obtain the necessary foreign regulatory approvals. If we are not successful in out-licensing our drug products outside of the United States or entering into other arrangements with partners capable of obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals to commercialize our drug products, we may be forced to seek regulatory approval and market these products ourselves. If we elect to seek regulatory approval ourselves, it may take longer than expected to obtain such approval and to market and manufacture our products. As a result, we may decide to delay or abandon development efforts in certain markets. Any such delay or abandonment, or any failure to receive one or more foreign approvals, may have an adverse effect on the benefits otherwise expected from marketing in foreign countries.\nIf we are successful in obtaining partners to develop and commercialize our drug products in foreign markets, we will be dependent upon their effectiveness in selling and marketing our drug products in those foreign markets. These partners may face stiff competition, government price regulations, generic versions of our drug products, violations of our intellectual property rights and other negative events or may otherwise be ineffective in commercializing our drug products, any of which could reduce the market potential for our drug products and our success in those markets.\nIf Dialysate Triferic, I.V. Triferic or any other drug product candidates are approved and marketed outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe may be subject to additional risks if Dialysate Triferic, I.V. Triferic or any other drug product candidates are approved and marketed outside of the United States, including:\n\u2022\nreduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\neconomic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;\n\u2022\nanti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \"FCPA\");\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenues, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from disease outbreaks, including the recent coronavirus disease epidemic, geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters, including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires.\nWe may not be successful in expanding our drug product portfolio or in our business development efforts related to in-licensing, acquisitions or other business collaborations. Even if we are able to enter into business development arrangements, they could have a negative impact on our business and our profitability.\nAs part of our business strategy to expand our drug product portfolio, we are seeking to acquire or in-license other drug products or product candidates that we believe are a complementary fit with our current product portfolio, as well as other product or product candidates that we believe have substantial development potential. We may not be able to identify such products or product candidates. If we do, the negotiation of such arrangements can be a lengthy and complex process and there can be no\nassurance that any such negotiations will be completed on a timely basis or at all, or result in an arrangement that will enable us to effectively integrate, develop and launch such products or product candidates effectively.\nIn addition, the market potential for new drug products or product candidates is highly uncertain and evaluation of such potential requires significant judgment and assumptions. There is a significant risk that any new drug product may not be able to be brought to market as profitably as expected or at all. If the results of any new drug product initiative are materially worse than expected, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur drug business depends on government funding of health care, and changes could impact our ability to be paid in full for our drug products, increase prices or cause consolidation in the dialysis provider market.\nMedicare and Medicaid fund the majority of dialysis costs in the United States. Many dialysis providers receive the majority of their funding from the government and are supplemented by payments from private health care insurers. These providers depend on Medicare and Medicaid funding to be viable businesses. Changes to health insurance and reimbursement by Congress may have a negative impact on Medicare and Medicaid funding and on reimbursement protocols. If Medicare and Medicaid funding were to be materially decreased, dialysis providers would be severely impacted, increasing our risk of not being paid in full. An increase in our exposure to uncollectible accounts could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nSince 2011, CMS has continued to modify reimbursement policies for dialysis under the ESRD prospective payment system generally resulting in lower payment to dialysis providers. We anticipate that dialysis providers will continue to seek ways to reduce their costs per treatment due to this change in reimbursement practice, which could reduce our sales and profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe Trump administration and members of Congress have introduced legislation in both the House of Representatives and Senate to repeal and/or replace all or part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"PPACA\"). Such legislation includes potential changes to or the repeal of Medicaid expansion, coverage for pre-existing conditions and insurance coverage minimum benefits. The likelihood of passage and the impact of this legislation is uncertain. However, it could potentially impact reimbursement by Medicare and Medicaid programs for our drug products and dialysis and could negatively affect the ability of certain individuals to obtain coverage. Other federal and state healthcare reform measures could be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, or change the methods used by Medicare and Medicaid to reimburse providers, including the \u201cbundled\u201d payment model and the availability of transitional separate reimbursement.\nAs a result of these changes to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, the dialysis provider industry may continue to consolidate. This may result in increased purchasing leverage for providers across all dialysis product categories and increased pricing pressure on all suppliers to the industry.\nWe have in-licensed rights to certain patents that cover our products. If we fail to remain in compliance with these license agreements, we could forfeit the rights to these patents, which could negatively impact our ability to commercialize our products.\nWe have acquired rights to certain patents under license agreements, including with an affiliate of Dr. Ajay Gupta, our Chief Scientific Officer. These in-licensed patent rights cover I.V. Triferic and have other claims that could cover Triferic and other products. If we fail to remain in compliance with the terms of these license agreements, including due diligence obligations relating to our efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products in certain markets, we could be found to be in breach of these license agreements. If this was to happen, the licensor could terminate the license agreement in certain circumstances, causing us to forfeit our rights to the licensed patents. This could cause us to lose the ability to sell certain products, including I.V. Triferic, and could potentially subject us to expensive and protracted litigation. Any of these occurrences could significantly harm our results of operations and future prospects.\nThe dialysis market is highly concentrated in the United States, with two organizations (DaVita and Fresenius) accounting for approximately 73% of the total number of hemodialysis patients. Given this concentrated market power, our success in commercializing Triferic will depend in part on the willingness of DaVita and Fresenius to adopt Triferic.\nThe dialysis market is highly concentrated in the United States. DaVita and Fresenius own or manage a large number of the outpatient dialysis facilities located in the United States, which account for 73% of the total number of hemodialysis patients in the United States. This represents a substantial majority of Triferic\u2019s addressable market opportunity in the free-standing dialysis clinic setting. Due to this concentration, these entities have substantial purchasing leverage, which may put pressure on our pricing by their potential ability to extract price discounts on our products, correspondingly negatively impacting our bargaining position\nand profit margins. Additionally, if one or both of these entities elect to not adopt Triferic, that decision would have a significant impact on our ability to successfully penetrate a large portion of the total addressable market in the United States.\nNew classes of drugs, such as HIF-PHIs, may limit the need for iron to be administered to ESRD patients.\nA new class of drugs, known as HIF-PHIs, is currently in development for a variety of indications, including the treatment of anemia for patients with chronic kidney disease. HIF-PHIs are designed to stimulate erythropoiesis and manage iron utilization and can be administered orally. Certain HIF-PHI compounds, including roxadustat and vadadustat, have reached or completed Phase 3 development in the United States, and an NDA for roxadustat was submitted in the United States in December 2019. If successfully developed and approved, HIF-PHIs could potentially offer a more convenient, more effective and/or safer alternative to injectable ESAs for treatment of anemia in CKD patients while potentially increasing iron availability for hemoglobin synthesis. It is possible that HIF-PHIs may significant limit or potentially eliminate the need for parenteral iron to be administered to patients on dialysis.\nHistorically, iron has been provided to patients within the dialysis setting via an intravenous push as this has been viewed as a more effective way to provide iron than oral iron products. However, it is possible that clinicians may start to provide patients with oral iron agents, instead of IV iron or Triferic. Significant utilization of oral agents would diminish the commercial opportunity of Triferic within ESRD dialysis patients receiving hemodialysis.\nPart of the growth strategy of the Triferic portfolio is to evaluate and potentially initiate clinical programs for new indications. We are currently conducting research as to the medical and economic viability of Triferic in new indications and it is possible that the research may determine that Triferic is not either medically or economically viable in new indications.\nA potential growth driver for the Triferic portfolio is the potential utility of Triferic in disease states outside of ESRD where iron replacement is required. We are currently performing an evaluation of the potential utility of Triferic in certain other disease states. It is possible that the results of this project may show that Triferic and/or its potential presentations may not be medically viable within these new disease states. It is also possible that the results of this project may demonstrate that even if Triferic were medically viable in new disease states, it would not be economically viable or we may not have the funds to conduct required clinical trials. To launch a product in a new disease state, we would likely need to substantially conclude that Triferic could supplement and/or compete with the current standard of care, and raise the funds needed for the development of such new indications.\nEven if we were to determine that Triferic is medically and economically viable in new indications, and even if we were able to obtain additional funding to conduct the necessary clinical trials, clinical trials for our products are expensive, may take several years to complete, and their outcomes are uncertain.\nAssuming that our research identifies new clinical indications for Triferic that would be both economically and medically feasible, and assuming that we were able to obtain the necessary funding to conduct clinical trials, conducting clinical trials is a lengthy, time-consuming and expensive process. We would incur substantial expense for both pre-clinical testing and clinical trials with no guarantee that these efforts would either be completed in a timely manner or that they would result in a positive outcome. Completion of clinical trials may take several years or more. The length of time can vary substantially with the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of the product. Factors that can influence and affect the rate of completion of clinical trials include: the potential delay by a partner in beginning a clinical trial; the failure of third-party contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and other third-party service providers and independent clinical investigators to manage and conduct the trials, to perform their oversight of the trials or to meet expected deadlines; the inability to recruit clinical trial participants at the expected rate; the inability to follow patients adequately after treatment; unforeseen safety issues; and unforeseen governmental or regulatory issues or concerns, including those of the FDA, DEA and other regulatory agencies.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR CONCENTRATE BUSINESS\nWe may be required to repay a portion of the upfront fees received from Baxter, which could materially and adversely affect our financial position and cash reserves.\nUpon the occurrence of a \u201cRefund Trigger Event\u201d under the Distribution Agreement with Baxter, we may be required to repay to Baxter $5.0 million of the $20.0 million upfront fee and a portion of the facility fee. A Refund Trigger Event includes, among other things, termination due to an uncured material breach by us. If we are required to make any such payment to Baxter, we may need to reallocate funds from other parts of our business, which could force us to change or delay plans for use of that\ncapital. In any such event, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash reserves could be materially and adversely affected.\nA few customers account for a substantial portion of the end user sales of our concentrate products. The loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nSales of our medical device products are highly concentrated in a few customers. One customer accounted for nearly half of our sales in each of the last three years and for a substantial number of the clinics we serve. The loss of any of these significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nWe provided Baxter with certain pricing concessions as an incentive to increase its domestic concentrate business. Baxter may not be successful in increasing its domestic concentrate business. If Baxter is not successful in increasing its concentrate business, we may realize lower operating profit from concentrates as a result.\nWe face competition in the concentrate market and have a large competitor with substantial resources.\nThe primary competitor in the market for our concentrate products is Fresenius, a large diversified company which has financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, research and management resources substantially greater than ours. We and our distributor, Baxter, may not be able to successfully compete with Fresenius. Fresenius has historically used product bundling and low pricing as a competitive strategy to capture market share of concentrate products. We and Baxter may be at a disadvantage in competing against these strategies to sell concentrate products. Furthermore, Fresenius is vertically integrated and is the largest provider of dialysis services in the United States, treating approximately 37% of all U.S. in-center hemodialysis patients through its clinics. Fresenius has routinely acquired our customers, and it may acquire more of our customers in the future.\nWe may be affected materially and adversely by increases in raw material and transportation costs.\nA significant portion of our costs relates to chemicals and other raw materials, which are subject to price volatility based on demand and are highly influenced by the overall level of economic activity in the United States and abroad. These costs have tended to rise from year to year and are likely to continue to rise in the future. Under the Distribution Agreement with Baxter, such cost inflation may result in increases in the prices we charge Baxter. If these increases exceed levels specified in the Distribution Agreement, Baxter has the option to terminate the Distribution Agreement and obtain a refund of a portion of the fees (as a Refund Trigger Event) we received from Baxter. Any such termination or refund could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Additionally, we have been adversely affected by a general shortage in commercial truckers in the United States. This has negatively impacted our profit margins as we pay higher costs to ship products to our customers. Continued increases in shipping costs, or the costs of raw materials, could negatively impact our profit margins, as we may be limited in our ability to pass these costs along to our customers.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION\nWe have limited capital resources and will likely need additional funding before we are able to achieve profitability. If we are unable to raise additional capital on attractive terms, or at all, we may be unable to sustain our operations.\nWe have limited capital resources, a cumulative deficit of approximately $306.5 million since inception and we expect to incur further losses for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $26.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments available-for-sale, and working capital of $24.5 million. Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $27.3 million.\nOn March 22, 2019, we entered into a sales agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (the \u201cAgent\u201d), pursuant to which we may offer and sell from time to time up to $40,000,000 of shares of common stock through the Agent. We are not required to sell any shares at any time during the term of the sales agreement. Our ability to sell common stock under the sales agreement may be limited by several factors, including, among other things, the trading volume of our common stock and certain black-out periods that we may impose upon the sales agreement, among other things.\nOn June 20, 2019, we closed a public offering of 5,833,334 shares of common stock at a price of $3.00 per share. On July 9, 2019, the underwriters of the public offering partially exercised their over-allotment option to purchase an additional 425,800 shares of common stock at a price of $3.00 per share, which closed on July 11, 2019.\nOn February 6, 2020, we closed a public offering of 3,191,489 shares of common stock at a price of $2.22 per share. On February 19, 2020, the underwriter of the public offering exercised its over-allotment option to purchase an additional 478,723 shares of common stock at a price of $2.22 per share in full, which closed on February 21, 2020.\nOn March 16, 2020, Rockwell Medical, Inc. and Rockwell Transportation, Inc., as Borrowers, entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the \"Loan Agreement\") with Innovatus Life Sciences Lending Fund I, LP, as collateral agent and the lenders party thereto to obtain term loans in an amount up to $35.0 million. $22.5 million was drawn under the Loan Agreement on the date of closing, and the remaining $12.5 million will be available for subsequent draws based on our achievement of certain milestones. Net proceeds at closing were approximately $21 million after deducting estimated fees and expenses of $1.5 million. Interest on the loans will accrue either in cash or a combination of cash and in kind interest, at our election. Cash interest will accrue at a rate equal to the greater of (i) Prime Rate (as defined in the Loan Agreement) and (ii) 4.75% plus 4.00%, for an initial interest rate of 8.75% per annum. We have the option, under certain circumstances, to add 1.00% of such interest rate amount to the then outstanding principal balance in lieu of paying such amount in cash. We are entitled to make interest-only payments for thirty months, or up to thirty-six months if certain conditions are met. The Loan Agreement contains representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default that are customary for credit facilities of this type. The term loans will mature on March 16, 2025.\nBased on the capital raise and debt financing noted above, management believes the Company currently has sufficient funds to meet its operating requirements for at least the next twelve months from the date of the filing of this report.\nThe Company will require additional capital to sustain its operations and make the investments it needs to execute upon its longer-term business plan, including the commercialization of Dialysate Triferic and I.V. Triferic, if approved, and executing plans for enhancing its medical capabilities and generating additional data for Triferic. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient revenue from its existing long-term business plan, the Company will need to obtain additional equity or debt financing. If the Company attempts to obtain additional debt or equity financing, the Company cannot assume that such financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nOur existing capital resources may not be adequate to finance our operating cash requirements for the length of time that we have estimated and additional capital that we may need to operate or expand our business may not be available.\nOur forecast of the period of time through which our existing capital resources will be adequate to support our current operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties. The actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe timing and expenditures associated with the commercialization of Dialysate Triferic and the timing and magnitude of cash received from product sales;\n\u2022\nthe timing and expenditures associated with the build-up of inventory;\n\u2022\nthe timing, design and conduct of, and results from, clinical trials that we may conduct; and\n\u2022\nthe timing of the licensing, partnering and acquisition of new product and product candidate opportunities.\nIf our cash is insufficient to meet our future operating requirements, we will have to raise additional funds. Our capital raising activities may include, but may not be limited to, the issuance of common stock or other securities via private placement or public offerings or the issuance of debt. While we may seek capital through a number of means, there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Furthermore, additional equity financings may be dilutive to our stockholders and newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nDebt financing, if available, may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict our ability to operate as a business. Additionally, we may have difficulty borrowing money through a term loan or debt facility given the covenants in our distribution agreement with Baxter which prohibit us from entering into a contract encumbering the assets used in our concentrate business. These assets currently constitute a substantial portion of the tangible assets we own. If our development activities require substantial cash resources in the future in excess of our liquid resources on hand and if our cash flows are not sufficient to support financing through unsecured indebtedness, we may not be able to obtain debt financing and our capital financing options may become limited.\nRegardless of whether we seek to raise additional working capital through the sale of equity securities or the incurrence of indebtedness, if we do not have sufficient funds available to successfully commercialize Dialysate Triferic, conduct planned clinical studies and pursue business opportunities, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur drug and concentrate businesses are highly regulated, resulting in additional expense and risk of noncompliance that can materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur businesses are highly regulated. The testing, manufacture and sale of the products we manufacture directly or through third party CMOs are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and by other federal, state and foreign authorities. Before drug product candidates or medical devices, such as our concentrate products, can be commercially marketed in the United States, the FDA must give either premarket approval or 510(k) clearance. After a product is approved, regulatory authorities may impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or requirements for potentially costly post-marketing studies. Our drug products are subject to ongoing regulatory requirements for labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, sampling, record- keeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information. In addition, manufacturers and their facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to current cGMP and applicable state laws. As such, we and our CMOs are subject to continual review and periodic inspections to assess compliance with cGMP and state laws. Accordingly, we and our partners must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance. We are also required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to applicable regulatory authorities and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our drug products or product candidates.\nIf non-compliant inventory is sold or if a regulatory agency determines that we are not compliant with any applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to warnings from, or enforcement action by, state and federal government authorities, which may include penalties, fines, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, suspension of production, denial of future regulatory approvals, withdrawal or suspension of existing regulatory approvals, operating restrictions, injunctions and criminal prosecution. If regulatory sanctions are applied, the value of our Company and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Our business could also be adversely affected by delays in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals and any restrictions placed by the FDA on our intended marketing or the use of our drug products.\nOur failure to comply with applicable regulations could also result in product liability litigation against us. In addition, our failure to comply with applicable regulations with respect to our concentrate products could constitute a breach by us of the Distribution Agreement, providing Baxter with various remedies that would be material and adverse to us. Moreover, changes in applicable regulatory requirements could significantly increase the costs of our operations, which, if such higher costs result in price increases that exceed the thresholds specified in the Distribution Agreement, could give Baxter the right to terminate the Distribution Agreement and obtain a partial refund of certain fees paid to us.\nOur business could be impacted as a result of actions by activist shareholders, including as a result of a potential proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting.\nThe Company was subjected to a proxy contest at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which resulted in the negotiation of changes to the Board and substantial costs were incurred. A future proxy contest would require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses and require significant time and attention by management and the Board. The potential of a proxy contest could interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan, give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, adversely affect our relationships with customers, suppliers, investors, prospective and current team members and others, result in the loss of potential business opportunities or make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe may also be subject, from time to time, to other legal and business challenges in the operation of our company due to actions instituted by activist shareholders. Responding to such actions, which may include publicity campaigns and, potentially, litigation, could be costly and time-consuming, divert the time and attention of our Board of Directors and management from our business, interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan, give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, adversely impact our lobbying efforts, adversely affect our relationships with customers, suppliers, prospective and current team members and others, result in the loss of potential business opportunities or make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. We cannot predict, and no assurances can be given as to, the outcome or timing of any matters relating to actions by activist shareholders or the ultimate impact on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain executives and key employees and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel in the future.\nWe are highly dependent on the product development, clinical and business development expertise of the principal members of our management, scientific and clinical team. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our\nexecutives and key employees, each of them may terminate their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d insurance for any of our executives or other employees.\nRecruiting and retaining qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing, sales and marketing personnel is critical to our success. The loss of the services of our executive officers or other key employees could impede the achievement of our development and commercialization objectives and seriously harm our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to successfully develop, gain regulatory approval of, and commercialize products. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel.\nWe hired a new Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in 2018 and have hired additional executive-level employees who are leading the commercialization of Dialysate Triferic. This leadership transition may be difficult to manage and may cause operational and administrative inefficiencies, added costs, decreased productivity among our employees, and loss of personnel with deep institutional knowledge, which could result in significant disruptions to our operations. In addition, we must successfully integrate our new management team members within our organization in order to achieve our operating objectives, and these changes in key management positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as our new management becomes familiar with our businesses. These changes could also increase the volatility of our stock price.\nWe also experience competition for the hiring of scientific and clinical personnel from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating drug product, nonclinical development, clinical development, regulatory strategy, and commercial strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to provide services to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to pursue our growth strategy will be limited. If we are unable to mitigate these or other similar risks, our businesses, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe expect to continue to expand our sales and marketing function, as well as our corporate operations, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018 and throughout 2019, we assembled sales and marketing leadership and a field-based sales team to support the commercialization of Dialysate Triferic in the United States. To manage this growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nWe could be found to be infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, which could prevent us from selling products and could require us to pay significant damages and compel us to defend against litigation.\nIt is possible that we may infringe on intellectual property rights of others without being aware of the infringement. If a third party believes that one of our drug products or product candidates infringes on the third party\u2019s patent, it may sue us even if we have received our own patent protection for the technology. If we infringe the rights of a third party, we could be prevented from manufacturing and selling products, forced to pay damages, compelled to license technology from the party claiming infringement and lose the opportunity to license our technology to others and collect royalty payments, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. If Baxter is prevented from selling any of our concentrate or ancillary products due to a patent infringement or if its ability to sell any of our concentrate or ancillary products due to a patent infringement is materially and adversely affected, Baxter may be entitled to terminate our Distribution Agreement and obtain a refund of a portion of the upfront fee and facility fee.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, we engage the services of consultants to assist us in the development of our drug products and product candidates. Many of these consultants were previously employed at, may have previously been, or are currently providing consulting services to, other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. As such, the Company advises consultants not to disclose, or use trade secrets, or proprietary information of their former employers or their former or current customers. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these consultants or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers or their former or current customers. Litigation may be necessary to\ndefend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and day-to-day business operations.\nOur drug products and product candidates may have undesirable side effects and our product liability insurance may not be sufficient to protect us from material liability or harm to our business.\nIf concerns are raised regarding the safety of a product candidate as a result of undesirable side effects identified during clinical testing, the FDA may decline to approve the product candidate at the end of the NDA review period or issue a letter requesting additional data or information prior to making a final decision regarding whether or not to approve the product candidate. Following FDA approval, if we or others later identify previously unknown undesirable side effects caused by our product candidate or concentrate products, if known side effects are more frequent or severe than in the past, or if we or others detect unexpected safety signals for such products or any products perceived to be similar to such products, the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities may require the addition of unfavorable labeling statements, specific warnings or contraindications, may suspend or withdraw their approval of the product, may require it to be removed from the market or may impose restrictions on the distribution or use of the product. Such side effects may also result in litigation against us by private litigants.\nWe maintain product liability insurance. We cannot be sure that such insurance would be sufficient to protect us against liabilities associated with any of these events in view of our expanding business or that such insurance will remain available at economical levels. We may have significant legal expenses that are not covered by insurance. In addition, our reputation could be damaged by such sanctions or product liability litigation and that could harm our business reputation and marketing ability. Any such sanctions or litigation could also hurt our ability to retain product liability insurance or make such insurance more expensive. In any such event, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees or directors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nMany of our employees and certain of our directors were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees and directors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees or directors have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s or director\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of a security breach, system failure, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of our or our business partners\u2019 critical information technology systems or infrastructure.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we and our business partners store sensitive data, including intellectual property and proprietary information related to our business, our customers and our business partners, on our information technology systems. Despite the implementation of security measures, these systems are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication, electrical and other system failures due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. We could experience a business interruption, intentional theft of confidential information or reputational damage, including damage to key customer and partner relationships, from system failures, espionage attacks, malware, ransomware or other cyber-attacks. Such cyber-security breaches may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our contractors or consultants. In particular, system failures or cyber-security breaches could result in the loss of nonclinical or clinical trial data from completed, ongoing or planned trials, which could cause delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.\nTo the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, including protected health information or personal data of employees or former employees, we could be subject to legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws and regulations governing the protection of health and other personally identifiable information and related regulatory penalties. In any such event, our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nWe use biological and hazardous materials, and any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming or costly.\nWe use hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological agents and compounds, which could be dangerous to human health and safety or the environment. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and wastes. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our pharmaceutical development efforts.\nIn addition, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes. If one of our employees was accidentally injured from the use, storage, handling or disposal of these materials or wastes, the medical costs related to his or her treatment would be covered by our workers\u2019 compensation insurance policy. However, we do not carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage and our property and casualty and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources, and our clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended, or operations otherwise affected.\nWe are and may become the target of additional securities and shareholder litigation, which is costly and time-consuming to defend.\nIn addition to the purported class action, shareholder derivative action and SEC investigation filed against us as described in Note 15 \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, it is possible that other legal proceedings could be brought against us in the future. The results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict. These lawsuits assert types of claims that, if resolved against us, could give rise to substantial damages, and an unfavorable outcome or settlement of these lawsuits, or any future lawsuits, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price. Even if any future lawsuits are not resolved against us, the costs of defending such lawsuits may be material to our business and our operations. Moreover, these lawsuits may divert our Board and our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. For more information on our legal proceedings, see Note 15 \u201cCommitments and Contingencies - Litigation\u201d in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAny adverse conclusions from our SEC investigation could result in fines, criminal penalties and an adverse effect on our business.\nWe received letters in 2017 from the SEC informing us that the SEC was conducting an inquiry into our accounts receivable and inventory, calculation practices regarding such information, as well as disclosure regarding our dispute with Baxter and requesting that we voluntarily provide certain information and documents relating to our accounts receivable and inventory calculations and reporting practices, as well as information relating to the Baxter dispute. In 2018, we received additional requests (including a subpoena) from the SEC asking for certain records and information relating to the termination of our prior Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as well as the facts and circumstances leading up to the resignation of our prior audit firm. The SEC\u2019s letters stated that the SEC\u2019s inquiry should not be construed as an indication that any violation of any federal securities laws has occurred. We have provided all of the requested information and documents to the SEC from the 2017 requests and are substantially complete in providing the requested information and documents from the 2018 subpoena. We have and will continue to fully cooperate with the SEC investigation. At this stage, we are unable to predict when the SEC\u2019s inquiry will conclude or what the consequences may be. Furthermore, any continuation of the SEC inquiry may cause a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nUnfavorable weather or global economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general weather conditions, as well as conditions in the global economy and in the global financial markets. A severe storm in our locations or those of our suppliers, or prolonged economic downturn, such as the recent global financial crisis, could result in a variety of risks to our business, including our ability to raise additional capital when needed on acceptable terms, if at all. This is particularly true in Europe, where the Brexit has created additional economic uncertainty. A weak or declining economy could also strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK\nThe restatement of our previously issued financial statements contained in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 may lead to additional risks and uncertainties, including regulatory, shareholder or other actions, loss of investor confidence and negative impacts on our stock price.\nOur Audit Committee, after consultation with management and discussing with outside counsel, external auditors and third-party consultants, concluded on August 12, 2018 that our previously issued consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 should be restated for the reasons described in \u201cExplanatory Note\u201d preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 3 - Restatement of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of the amended Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Our amended Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 includes restated unaudited financial statements and selected financial data (and related disclosures). Financial information included in our previously filed Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, and all earnings press release and similar communications issued by us, for the period, should not be relied upon and are superseded in their entirety by our amended Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. The amended Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 amends and restates, in its entirety, our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nAs a result of this restatement and associated non-reliance on previously issued financial information, we have become subject to a number of additional costs and risks, including unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement and the remediation of our ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. Likewise, the attention of our Board and our management team has been diverted by these efforts. In addition, we could also be subject to additional shareholder, governmental, regulatory or other actions or demands in connection with the restatement or other matters. Any such proceedings will, regardless of the outcome, consume a significant amount of the Board\u2019s and management\u2019s time and attention and may result in additional legal, accounting, insurance and other costs. If we do not prevail in any such proceedings, we could be required to pay damages or settlement costs. In addition, the restatement and related matters could impair our reputation or could cause our customers, stockholders, or other counterparties to lose confidence in us. Any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nOur plan to remediate the identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may not be sufficient to correct all material weaknesses and deficiencies.\nAS of December 31, 2019, we had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, as described below. A \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Specifically, management identified control deficiencies related to Information Technology General Controls (\u201cITGC\u201d) in connection with change management, user access controls and segregation of duties as it relates to user access controls. The Company\u2019s ITGC user access security, change management, operations and third-party management controls to the ERP system were not designed effectively to provide an adequate audit trail for system change management and for the periodic review and testing of user access rights and permissions. The ITGC material weakness in our ERP had a pervasive impact to the various activity level cycles and accounts, including financial reporting, distribution, revenue and accounts receivable, inventory and cost of goods, expenditures and accounts payable, treasury and payroll, and creates a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to the consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis and represents a material weakness in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Although our Audit Committee and management are implementing improvements to our internal controls to remediate the identified material weaknesses, these improvements may not be effective to fully remediate such material weakness or prevent a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements in the future.\nShares eligible for future sale may affect the market price of our common stock.\nAny future sales by us of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the possibility of such sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and also impair our ability to raise capital through an offering of our equity securities in the future. In the future, we may issue additional shares or warrants in connection with investments or for other purposes considered advisable by our Board of Directors. Any substantial sale of our common stock may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and may dilute the economic value and voting rights of existing stockholders.\nIn addition, as of December 31, 2019, there were 6,481,095 shares issuable upon the exercise of the then-outstanding and exercisable stock options and 1,728,929 shares issuable upon the exercise of then-outstanding stock options that were not yet exercisable. The market price of the common stock may be depressed by the potential exercise of these options. The holders of these options are likely to exercise them when we would otherwise be able to obtain additional capital on more favorable terms than those provided by the options.\nThe market price for our common stock is volatile.\nOur stock price, like the market price of many stocks in the specialty pharmaceutical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, is volatile. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates, and delays or failures to obtain such approvals;\n\u2022\nfailure of any of our drug products or product candidates, if approved, to achieve commercial success;\n\u2022\nissues in manufacturing our drug products or product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe results of our current and any future clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe entry into, or termination of, key agreements, including key commercial partner agreements;\n\u2022\nthe initiation of, material developments in, or conclusion of litigation to enforce or defend any of our intellectual property rights or defend against the intellectual property rights of others;\n\u2022\nannouncements by commercial partners or competitors of new commercial products, clinical progress or the lack thereof, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of technological innovations or new therapies that compete with our products;\n\u2022\nthe loss of key employees;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any, who cover our common stock;\n\u2022\ngeneral and industry-specific economic conditions that may affect our research and development expenditures;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems; and\n\u2022\nthe reporting of sales, operating results and cash resources.\nIn addition, third parties may engage in trading strategies that result in intentional volatility to and control over our stock price. Moreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm our profitability and reputation.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards to offset potential taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due may be limited.\nWe have substantial net operating loss carryforwards (\"NOLs\") available to reduce future taxable income. Our ability to use our NOLs to offset potential future taxable income and related income taxes that would otherwise be due is dependent upon our generation of future taxable income before the expiration dates of the NOLs. In addition to uncertainty regarding our future profitability, our use of the NOLs may be subject to annual limitations under the \u201cownership change\u201d provisions of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which may result in the expiration of some or all of the NOLs before they can be used. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if, during a rolling three-year period, there is a greater than 50% change in the percentage ownership of the corporation by 5% owners (and persons treated as 5% owners), as defined in Section 382 and related regulations. We may experience an ownership change in the future as a result of future changes in our stock ownership. The inability to use our NOLs to reduce federal taxable income could result in increased future tax liability to us and reduce the cash that would otherwise be available to our business.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.\nSince inception, we have not paid any cash dividend on our common stock and do not anticipate paying such dividends in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and requirements, future prospects, restrictions in future financing agreements, business conditions and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. We intend to retain earnings and any cash resources to finance our operations. Therefore, it is highly unlikely we will pay cash dividends.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they publish negative evaluations, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be impacted by the availability or lack of research and reports that third-party industry or financial analysts publish about the Company. There are many large, publicly traded companies active in the biopharmaceutical industry, which may mean it will be less likely that we receive widespread analyst coverage. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover the Company downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If we do not receive adequate coverage by reputable analysts that have an understanding of our business and industry, we could fail to achieve visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could prevent a third party from acquiring us (even if an acquisition would benefit our stockholders), may limit the ability of our stockholders to replace our management and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of us. These provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of the company and could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions, among other things:\n\u2022\nestablish a staggered board of directors divided into three classes serving staggered three-year terms, such that not all members of the board will be elected at one time;\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval and create, subject to applicable law, a series of preferred stock with preferential rights to dividends or our assets upon liquidation, or with superior voting rights to our existing common stock;\n\u2022\ndisallow our stockholders to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at our annual stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\npermit our board of directors to establish the number of directors between three and fifteen;\n\u2022\nprovide that stockholders can remove directors only for cause and only upon the approval of not less than a majority of all outstanding shares of our voting stock;\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of not less than a majority of all outstanding shares of our voting stock to amend our bylaws and specific provisions of our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022\nlimit the jurisdictions in which certain stockholder litigation may be brought.\nWe are not subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could negatively affect your investment.\nWe elected in our certificate of incorporation to not be subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cSection 203\u201d). In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A \u201cbusiness combination\u201d includes a merger, asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns (or, in certain cases, within three years prior, did own) 15% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock. This may make us more vulnerable to takeovers that are completed without the approval of our Board of Directors and/or without giving us the ability to prohibit or delay such takeovers as effectively.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, another state court or a federal court located within the State of Delaware) is the exclusive forum for any claims that are based upon a violation of a duty by a current or former director, officer, employee or stockholder in such capacity, or as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction upon the Court of Chancery. This provision would not apply to claims brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. This choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business.", "PERMNO": 85744, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "RMTI"}
