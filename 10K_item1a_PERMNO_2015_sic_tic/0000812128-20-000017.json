{"cik": "812128", "company": "SANDERSON FARMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-12-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic and Other Events\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our business.\nThe public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by governments, businesses, including us, and the public at large to limit the spread of the disease have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on our business including, without limitation, the following:\n\u2022We have experienced a decrease in demand and commodity prices for products from our plants that serve food service customers, restaurants, and other customers who sell food for consumption away from home. These customers have been significantly negatively affected by stay-at-home restrictions or recommendations, closings of restaurants, social distancing requirements and cancellations of major sporting and other events. This negative trend may continue to some degree even though government restrictions are reduced or lifted because restaurants and other venues may be required to operate at reduced capacities and consumers may fear gathering in public places. In addition, resurgences of COVID-19 infections after restrictions are lifted are causing and could continue to cause governments to impose new or stricter closure, capacity or social distancing requirements. This could cause consumer demand for food away from home to worsen. While we have experienced increased demand for products from our plants that serve retail grocery store customers, that increase in demand cannot entirely offset the decrease in demand from our food service customers. We also cannot predict whether and to what extent changes in consumer food purchasing behavior will persist even after the threat of the pandemic has been eliminated or how those changes would affect our business.\n\u2022Deteriorating economic and political conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased unemployment, decreases in disposable income and consumer spending, declines in consumer confidence, changes in consumer buying patterns, or economic slowdowns or recessions, may contribute to lower demand for our products, especially products from our plants that serve food service customers.\n\u2022We have experienced some disruption in our operations due to the pandemic, including higher than normal absenteeism related to COVID-19 among our hourly employees and inefficiencies from a significant number of new hires. While we have been able to operate despite these disruptions, a higher level of disruption could materially and adversely affect our operations. For example, although we are taking measures to protect our employees and prevent the spread of coronavirus in our facilities, these measures may not be sufficient to prevent an outbreak of infections among our employees. Government restrictions like social distancing regulations or limits on the number of persons who can be present in our facilities could also impair operations. The absence of a significant number of employees to staff our plants could cause a material reduction in our production volumes and could also hurt our ability to make certain products that require more labor to produce. If an outbreak at any of our facilities is severe, we could even be forced to close the facility, which in turn would constrain our ability to meet customer orders, increase our costs and reduce our revenues.\n\u2022We have incurred additional expenses directly related to COVID-19, which consist primarily of additional wage expense to pay our $1 per hour attendance bonus, paid time off for employees who are not working for reasons related to COVID-19 and overtime expense to run our plants that produce product for retail grocery store customers on Saturdays to meet increased demand. We have also incurred costs for personal protective equipment, cleaning, on-site medical clinics and other measures we have taken in our facilities to protect against the spread of disease. These expenses may be ongoing for an uncertain period of time and could increase if we are required to take additional measures to ensure we can continue to operate during the pandemic.\n\u2022Some meat producers in the United States have experienced significant outbreaks of COVID-19 among their employees, which has caused some meat processing plants to close. This has led to public and media criticism of companies and the meat packing industry in general, including the poultry industry, for their management of the pandemic and working conditions for their employees. We could be affected by negative public perception of our industry resulting from the pandemic.\n\u2022If the pandemic worsens in countries where we ship our products, we could face more significant delays than we have experienced to date in the delivery of our product in the export markets due to, among other things, additional safety requirements imposed by port authorities, closures of or congestion at ports, and other capacity constraints. Additionally, while we have so far not experienced significant delays in the distribution of our products to our customers within the United States, higher rates of infection or illness among truck drivers could create domestic shipping delays.\n\u2022Declining oil prices, which have been caused in part by the contraction of commercial activity worldwide due to the pandemic, have limited and may continue to limit the ability of some of our export customers to purchase our products because their domestic economies depend on oil. Additionally, the value of the U.S. dollar versus some foreign currencies has increased. This has led and may continue to lead to weaker demand and prices for our products in the export markets.\n\u2022If the effects of the pandemic continue to cause market prices for our products to fall, then as further explained below, we may have to record adjustments to write down the carrying values of our live inventories in future quarters.\n\u2022As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have permitted some office-based employees who are at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19 to work remotely. Our information technology systems may be more vulnerable to cyber attacks or other disruptions as a result of team members accessing our networks and systems from off-site.\n\u2022Actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in legal claims or litigation against us.\n\u2022We rely on third-party service providers and business partners, such as independent contract poultry producers, cloud data storage and other information technology service providers, suppliers (particularly suppliers of feed grains), distributors, and other external business partners, for certain functions or services that support key portions of our operations. These third-party service providers and business partners are subject to risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which may interfere with their ability to fulfill their respective commitments and responsibilities to us in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreed-upon terms.\n\u2022We may experience an increase in working capital needs and/or an increase in trade accounts receivable write-offs (and associated reserves) as a result of increased financial pressures on our suppliers or customers who are not able to pay in a timely manner or at all.\n\u2022Depending on the duration of the pandemic and market conditions for our products, we may need to preserve liquidity, which could result in a reduction or suspension of our quarterly dividend or delays in implementing or an inability to implement our strategic planning initiatives.\n\u2022The resumption of normal business operations after the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may be delayed or constrained by its lingering effects on our customers, consumers, independent contract poultry producers or third-party service providers.\n\u2022Governmental authorities in the United States may increase or impose new income taxes or indirect taxes, or revise interpretations of existing tax rules and regulations, as a means of financing the costs of stimulus and other measures enacted or taken, or that may be enacted or taken in the future, to protect the United States economy from the impact of the pandemic. Such actions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAny of the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including those described above, may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Any of these negative impacts could exacerbate the other risk factors discussed below. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and that we cannot predict, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.\nOur operations, or those of our business partners, independent contract poultry producers and customers, and demand for our products could be adversely affected by events outside of our control such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks, epidemics, pandemics, war, or the fear of these events.\nWe may be affected by natural disasters, terrorist attacks, epidemics, pandemics like COVID-19, war or other events outside of our control. These events may impact our operations directly, or may disrupt the operations of our business partners, feed grain and other suppliers, independent contract poultry producers and customers in ways that can adversely\naffect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Fear of such events might also alter consumer confidence, behavior and spending patterns, which could decrease demand for protein, including our products.\nRisks Related to Industry Volatility\nIndustry volatility can affect our earnings, especially due to fluctuations in commodity prices of feed ingredients and chicken.\nProfitability in the poultry industry is materially affected by the commodity prices of feed ingredients, chicken, and, to a lesser extent, alternative proteins. These prices are determined by supply and demand factors, and supply and demand factors related to feed ingredients and chicken may not correlate. As a result, the poultry industry is subject to wide fluctuations in profitability. Typically we do well when chicken prices are high and feed prices are low. We are less profitable, and sometimes have losses, when chicken prices are low and feed prices are high. For example, grain prices during 2011 were high, while prices for chicken products did not increase proportionally, and the Company recorded a net loss. During 2012 and 2013, grain prices remained high, but market prices for chicken also increased, and the Company was profitable. During fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015, grain prices declined while market prices for chicken increased, and the Company earned near record-high margins.\nVarious factors that are beyond our control can affect the supply of corn and soybean meal, our primary feed ingredients. In particular, global weather patterns, including adverse weather conditions that may result from climate change, the global level of supply inventories and demand for feed ingredients, currency fluctuations and the agricultural and energy policies of the United States and foreign governments all affect the supply and demand of feed ingredients. Weather patterns often change agricultural conditions in an unpredictable manner. A sudden and significant change in weather patterns could affect supplies of feed ingredients, as well as both the industry\u2019s and our ability to obtain feed ingredients, grow chickens or deliver products. Additionally, an increase in ethanol producers' demand for corn has historically resulted in increases in the costs for corn and other grains.\nIncreases in the prices of feed ingredients will result in increases in raw material costs and operating costs. Because prices for our products are related to the commodity prices of chickens, which depend on the supply and demand dynamics of fresh chicken, we typically are not able to increase our product prices to offset increased grain costs. Although we periodically enter into contracts to purchase feed ingredients at current prices for future delivery to manage our feed ingredient costs, this practice does not eliminate the risk of increased operating costs from commodity price increases. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in our grain buying strategy, we could actually pay a higher cost for feed ingredients than we would if we purchased at current prices for current delivery.\nIt is very difficult to predict how the chicken and grain markets will perform. The exposure of our business to the cyclical nature and volatility of commodities markets for raw materials and poultry could adversely affect our profitability, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be required to write down the value of our inventories if the net realizable value of our inventories is less than their accumulated cost at the end of a fiscal period.\nPrepared chicken and poultry inventories, and inventories of feed, eggs, medication, packaging supplies and live chickens, are stated on our balance sheet at the lower of cost (average method) or net realizable value. Our cost of sales is calculated during a period by adding the value of our inventories at the beginning of the period to the cost of growing, processing and distributing products produced during the period and subtracting the value of our inventories at the end of the period. If the net realizable values of our inventories are below the accumulated cost of those inventories at the end of a period, we record adjustments to write down the carrying value of the inventory from cost to net realizable value. These write-downs directly increase our cost of sales by the amount of the write-downs. This risk is greatest when the costs of feed ingredients are high and the market value for finished poultry products is declining.\nAny such adjustment we may make in one period effectively absorbs into that period a portion of the costs to grow, process and distribute chickens that we would have otherwise incurred in the next fiscal period, thereby benefiting the next period. Any such adjustments that we make in the future could be material, and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The Company recorded a charge of $2.8 million at October 31, 2019 and $9.6 million at October 31, 2018 to reduce the values of live inventories on hand at those dates from cost to net realizable value. The Company recorded no such charge at October 31, 2020.\nA decrease in demand for our products in the export markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nNearly all of our customers are based in the United States, but we sell some of our product to foreign customers and some to United States based customers who resell the product in the export markets. Approximately 8.5% of our gross sales in fiscal 2020 were to foreign customers or customers based in the United States who resell product in other countries, including approximately $143.8 million to customers who resell product in Mexico and $79.8 million to customers who resell product in China. Any disruption in the export markets could materially adversely affect our revenues or create an oversupply of poultry in the United States, which would cause domestic poultry prices to decline. Disruptions could include, for example:\n\u2022trade embargoes, tariffs, import bans, duties, or quotas;\n\u2022currency fluctuations;\n\u2022adverse political, social or economic conditions in countries to which we export our products;\n\u2022disruptions in shipping channels; and\n\u2022changes in governmental trade policies or agreements with countries to which we sell products.\nAny of these conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nFor example, the outbreak of African swine fever in China in 2019 affected the worldwide supply of pork. In November 2019, China lifted its nearly five-year ban on the import of United States poultry, and we resumed shipments almost immediately. The deficit of protein available to consumers in China as a result of African swine fever in that country had been widely expected to create additional demand for protein produced in the United States. However, the spread of COVID-19 in China and the government's actions to limit the spread of the virus depressed Chinese demand for protein during our 2020 fiscal year because quarantines limited travel within the country and restaurants were closed. Demand for our products other than chicken paws softened during the second half of fiscal 2020 as China rebuilt its cold storage inventories and consumers in China did not return to restaurants in the same numbers as before the COVID-19 outbreak. Similar conditions have occurred in other countries to which we export our product as COVID-19 has spread. We do not know how long and to what extent the pandemic will impact demand for our products in export markets.\nOur stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as the following, many of which are beyond our control:\n\u2022market volatility and fluctuations in the price of feed grains and chicken products, as described above;\n\u2022quarterly variations in our operating results, or results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022changes in investor perceptions of the poultry industry in general, including our competitors; and\n\u2022general economic and competitive conditions.\nIn addition, purchases or sales of large quantities of our stock, or significant short positions in our stock, could have an unusual or adverse effect on our market price.\nOperational Risks\nInclement weather, such as excessive heat or storms, or other natural disasters, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nExtreme weather in the areas where we operate or where our feed grains are grown, such as extreme temperatures, drought, hurricanes or other storms, or other natural disasters, could increase our costs, impair the health or growth of our flocks or interfere with our hatching, production or shipping operations. For example, historic drought conditions in the Midwestern United States in 2012 had a significant adverse effect on the supply and price of feed grains in fiscal 2012 and the first three quarters of 2013. Scientists believe that climate change could increase the frequency and severity of adverse weather events. Extreme weather, regardless of its cause, or other adverse events, could affect our business by causing, among other things:\n\u2022shortages or high prices of corn, soybeans or other grains we use to make feed;\n\u2022power outages;\n\u2022fuel shortages;\n\u2022damage to infrastructure or our facilities;\n\u2022damage or destruction of live, raw material, or finished goods inventories;\n\u2022water shortages;\n\u2022disruption of shipping channels;\n\u2022less efficient or non-routine operating practices necessitated by adverse events; or\n\u2022increased costs of insurance coverage in the aftermath of such events.\nAny of these factors could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. We may not be able to recover through insurance all of the damages, losses or costs that may result from such adverse events, including those that may be caused by climate change.\nOutbreaks of avian disease, such as avian influenza, or the perception that outbreaks may occur, can significantly restrict our ability to conduct our operations and can significantly affect demand for our products.\nEvents beyond our control, such as the outbreak of avian disease or the perception that an outbreak may occur, even if it does not affect our flocks, could significantly restrict our ability to conduct our operations or our sales. An outbreak of disease could result in governmental restrictions on the import and export of fresh and frozen chicken, including our fresh and frozen chicken products, or other products to or from our suppliers, facilities or customers, or require us to destroy one or more of our flocks. This could result in the cancellation of orders by our customers and create adverse publicity that may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and prospects. In addition, world-wide fears about avian disease, such as avian influenza, have, in the past, depressed demand for fresh chicken, which adversely affected our sales during and around that time.\nIn past years there has been substantial publicity regarding a highly pathogenic Asian strain of avian influenza, or AI, known as H5N1, which has affected Asia since 2002 and which has been found in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. It is widely believed that this strain of AI is spread by migratory birds, such as ducks and geese. There have also been some cases where this strain of AI is believed to have passed from birds to humans as humans came into contact with live birds that were infected with the disease.\nAlthough the Asian strains of AI described above have not been identified in North America, there have been outbreaks of both low and high pathogenic strains of non-Asian avian influenza in recent years in North America, including in the U.S. and Mexico.\nUntil 2015, the outbreaks in North America had not generated the same level of concern, or received the same level of publicity, or been accompanied by the same reduction in demand for poultry products in certain countries, as that associated with the Asian strains. Beginning in January 2015, however, the United States experienced what some industry observers believe was the worst avian influenza outbreak in United States history. According to the United States Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), approximately 7.8 million turkeys and 40.3 million chickens were affected in the United States by this avian influenza outbreak, and the last reported case was in June 2015. The affected chickens were almost all hens that lay eggs for the table egg industry, and not broiler chickens such as those we raise.\nWe have a high degree of confidence in our industry\u2019s biosecurity program, but we cannot be certain our flocks or others in our industry will not be affected by AI. Given our high degree of confidence in our biosecurity programs, we believe the primary risks associated with domestic outbreaks of avian influenza are market risks, as many countries to which our industry sells product imposed partial or total bans on the import of broiler meat produced in the United States as a result of the 2015 outbreak.\nAll AI related bans that were imposed following the 2015 outbreak in the United States have been lifted, the last of which was lifted by China on November 14, 2019. While these bans were in place, the market price for leg quarters fell significantly below historical averages. For more information on the impact of this outbreak on exports, please see the risk factor above entitled \u201cA decrease in demand for our products in the export markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\u201d\nWhile domestic demand for broiler meat was not materially affected by the 2015 outbreak, we cannot assure you that further spread of AI or the outbreak of the Asian strains of AI either in other countries or in the United States will not materially adversely affect both domestic and international demand for poultry products produced in the United States. Because the virus is carried by migratory water fowl, it is possible the virus could be spread to domestic poultry flocks during any seasonal migration of those water fowl. If AI were to affect a significant number of our flocks, or materially reduce domestic demand for our products, either or both of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation or prospects.\nFailure of our information technology infrastructure or software could adversely affect our day-to-day operations and decision making processes and have an adverse effect on our performance.\nWe depend on accurate and timely information and numerical data from key software applications to aid our day-to-day business, financial reporting and decision-making and, in many cases, proprietary and custom-designed software is necessary to operate equipment in our feed mills, hatcheries and processing plants. In our day-to-day business, we depend on information technology for, among other things, electronic communications between our facilities, personnel, customers and suppliers, and for digital marketing and public information.\nWe have put in place disaster recovery plans for our critical systems. However, any disruption caused by the failure of these systems, the underlying equipment, or communication networks could delay or otherwise adversely impact our day-to-day business and decision making, could make it impossible for us to operate critical equipment, and could have a materially adverse effect on our performance, if our disaster recovery plans do not mitigate the disruption. Disruptions could be caused by a variety of factors, such as catastrophic events or weather, natural disasters, power or telecommunications outages, viruses, terrorist attacks, or unauthorized access or cyber-attacks on our systems by outside parties. In addition, a breach of our cyber-security measures could result in the loss, destruction or theft of confidential or proprietary data or other consequences, and could expose us to material losses or liability to third parties. Similar risks exist with respect to third parties who may possess our confidential data, such as our IT support providers, third party benefit and other administrators, professional advisors and consultants, and our financial institutions.\nCyber-attacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, and are constantly evolving in nature and sophistication. Our failure to maintain our cyber-security measures and keep abreast of new and evolving threats may make our systems vulnerable. The vulnerability of our systems and our failure to identify or respond timely to cyber incidents could have an adverse effect on our operations and reputation and expose us to liability or regulatory enforcement actions.\nWe depend on the availability of, and good relations with, our employees and contract growers.\nWe have approximately 17,445 employees, approximately 2,165 of which are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In addition, we contract with approximately 1,054 independent contract poultry producers in Mississippi, Texas, North Carolina and Georgia for the grow-out of our breeder and broiler stock and the production of broiler eggs. Our operations depend on the availability of labor and contract growers and maintaining good relations with these persons and with labor unions. If we fail to maintain good relations with our employees or with the unions, we may experience labor strikes or work stoppages. If we do not attract and maintain contracts with our growers, including new growers for our new poultry complexes, our production operations could be negatively impacted and/or our growth could be constrained.\nWe rely heavily on the services of key personnel.\nWe depend substantially on the leadership of a small number of executive officers and other key employees. We have employment agreements with only three of these persons (our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer; our President and Chief Operating Officer; and our Treasurer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Legal Officer), and those with whom we have no agreement would not be bound by non-competition agreements or non-solicitation agreements if they were to leave us. The loss of the services of these persons could deplete our institutional knowledge and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to attract, retain and train the new management personnel we need for our new complexes, or do so at the pace necessary to sustain our significant company growth.\nMarketing and Sales Risks\nThe loss of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur sales to our top ten customers represented approximately 52.0% of our net sales during fiscal 2020. Our contracts with our customers provide pricing structures, but do not require customers to purchase any specific quantity of product. Therefore, our customers could significantly reduce or cease their purchases from us with little or no advance notice, which could materially and adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\nWe must identify changing consumer preferences, trends and purchasing behaviors, and offer food products that consumers want.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to offer products that appeal to our customers and to respond to evolving consumer preferences, trends and purchasing behaviors. Consumer behavior is influenced by factors such as, among other things:\n\u2022perceptions about the health and social implications of food products;\n\u2022safety and quality of food products;\n\u2022price; and\n\u2022distribution channels.\nConsumers are sometimes influenced by negative publicity about food production, including stories that are inaccurate or misleading. The expanding role of social and digital media has increased the speed and extent to which people can share information (whether or not accurate) and opinions about our products. If we do not identify and react timely to negative publicity, or inaccurate or misleading stories, we may experience reduced demand and pricing for our products. Prolonged negative perceptions about our products, our brand or our Company, or a loss of confidence by consumers in our products, could materially and adversely affect our reputation, sales, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may also introduce new products and improved products from time to time to satisfy evolving consumer preferences, trends and purchasing behaviors, and may incur significant development and marketing costs in doing so. If our products fail to meet evolving consumer preferences, trends and purchasing behaviors, then these products and our marketing strategy will be less successful. Additionally, because we produce only chicken products, we may be limited in our ability to respond to changes in consumer preferences towards other animal proteins or away from animal proteins entirely.\nWe have devoted significant resources to marketing and public relations programs that inform consumers about the safety and quality of our products and our production practices, including our use of antibiotics in raising live chickens. However, we are subject to legal and regulatory restrictions on the marketing and labeling of our products, which may hamper our marketing efforts. We must also keep pace with a rapidly changing media environment and advertising and marketing channels. If our marketing and public relations efforts are not effective, if consumers believe we have acted irresponsibly, or we are not successful in developing and marketing new products, then our competitive position, reputation and market share may suffer. This, in turn, could lead to lower sales and profits, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe poultry industry is highly competitive.\nIn general, the competitive factors in the U.S. poultry industry include:\n\u2022price;\n\u2022product quality;\n\u2022brand identification;\n\u2022innovation;\n\u2022breadth of product line; and\n\u2022customer service.\nCompetitive factors vary by major customer markets. Some of our competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than we have. In the food service market, competition is based on consistent quality, product development, customer service and price. In the U.S. retail grocery market, we believe that competition is based on product quality, brand awareness, price and customer service. Our success depends in part on our ability to manage costs and be efficient in the highly competitive poultry industry.\nRisks Related to Our Growth Strategy\nWe would be adversely affected if we expand our business by acquiring other businesses or by building new facilities, but fail to successfully integrate the acquired business or run a new facility efficiently.\nWe regularly evaluate expansion opportunities such as acquiring other businesses or building new facilities. Significant expansion involves risks such as:\n\u2022the availability and terms of additional debt or equity financing and its effect on our financial condition;\n\u2022increases in our expenses and working capital needs;\n\u2022integrating the acquired business or new facilities into our operations;\n\u2022attracting and retaining growers;\n\u2022streamlining overlapping supply chains;\n\u2022identifying customers for additional product we produce and retaining existing customers; and\n\u2022identifying and training key managers and employees to run the new business or facility, while continuing to operate our existing facilities efficiently.\nAdditional risks related to acquisition transactions may include:\n\u2022difficulty identifying suitable candidates for acquisitions or consummating transactions on terms that are favorable;\n\u2022implementing and maintaining consistent standards, controls, procedures and information systems;\n\u2022potential loss of key employees or customers of any acquired business;\n\u2022managing the geographic distance of an acquired business from our other facilities; and\n\u2022exposure to unforeseen or undisclosed liabilities of any acquired business.\nSuccessful expansion depends on our ability to timely integrate the acquired business or efficiently operate the new facility, to devote significant management attention to the project and its integration in our business, and to manage a larger overall company efficiently. If we are unable to do this, expansion could adversely affect our operations, financial results and prospects, and we might not realize the cost savings and synergies we expected from the expansion. Additionally, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from day-to-day business operations and the execution of our strategic plan could adversely impact our performance.\nThe construction and potential benefits of our new facilities are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nFor any new facility that we build, our ability to complete construction on a timely basis and within budget is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties described below. In addition, when a new facility becomes operational, it may not generate the benefits we expect if demand for the products to be produced by the facility is different from what we expect or we do not operate the facility efficiently.\nIn order to complete construction of a new facility, we need to take a significant number of steps and obtain a number of approvals and permits, none of which we can assure you will be obtained. For example, for each new fresh and frozen chicken complex, we need to:\n\u2022identify a site and purchase or lease such site;\n\u2022obtain a number of licenses and permits;\n\u2022enter into construction contracts;\n\u2022identify and enter into contracts with a sufficient number of independent contract poultry producers;\n\u2022complete construction on time; and\n\u2022hire and train our workforce.\nIf we are unable to complete construction on schedule, attract independent contract poultry producers, find customers for the additional product produced by the new facility, run the facility efficiently, or otherwise achieve the expected benefits of our new facilities, our business could be negatively affected.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nImmigration legislation and enforcement may affect our ability to hire hourly workers.\nImmigration reform continues to attract significant attention in the public arena and the United States Congress. If new immigration legislation is enacted at the federal level or in states in which we do business, such legislation may contain provisions that could make it more difficult or costly for us to hire United States citizens and/or legal immigrant workers. In such case, we may incur additional costs to run our business or may have to change the way we conduct our operations, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. Also, despite our past and continuing efforts to hire only United States citizens and/or persons legally authorized to work in the United States, increased enforcement efforts with respect to existing immigration laws by governmental authorities may disrupt a portion of our workforce or our operations at one or more of our facilities, thereby negatively affecting our business. Officials with the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement have informally indicated intent to focus their enforcement efforts on meat and poultry processors.\nIf our poultry products become contaminated, we may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls.\nPoultry products may contain disease-producing organisms, or pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella and generic E. coli. These pathogens are generally found in the environment and, as a result, there is a risk that they could be present in our processed poultry products as a result of food processing. In addition, it is possible foreign material such as metal, plastic or other material used in our processing plants could contaminate product during processing. Pathogens or foreign material can also be introduced as a result of improper handling by our customers, consumers or third parties after we have shipped the products. We control these risks through careful processing and testing of our finished product, but we cannot entirely eliminate them. We have little, if any, control over proper handling once the product has been shipped. Nevertheless, contamination that results from improper handling by our customers, consumers or third parties, or tampering\nwith our products by those persons, may be blamed on us. Any publicity regarding product contamination or resulting illness or death, even if we did not cause the contamination, could lead to increased scrutiny by regulators and could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and future prospects.\nIf our products are contaminated or damaged, we could also be required to recall our products or close our plants, and product liability claims could be asserted against us. A widespread product recall could be costly and could cause significant losses, the destruction of product inventory, lost sales or customers due to the unavailability of product, adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products.\nWe are exposed to risks relating to product liability, product recalls, property damage and injuries to persons, for which insurance coverage is expensive, limited and potentially inadequate.\nOur business operations entail a number of risks, including risks relating to product liability claims, product recalls, property damage and injuries to persons. The insurance we maintain with respect to certain of these risks, including product liability and recall insurance, property insurance, workers compensation insurance and general liability insurance, is expensive and difficult to obtain. We cannot assure you that we can maintain on reasonable terms sufficient coverage to protect us against losses due to any of these events.\nGovernmental regulation and litigation are constant factors affecting our business.\nThe poultry industry is subject to federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulation relating to production of food animals and the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling, quality and safety of food products. We are also subject to laws and regulations affecting businesses and public companies generally, including domestic and foreign regulations that affect our export activity, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Unknown matters, new laws and regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws or regulations may materially affect or restrict our business and operations or increase our costs in the future. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties, including fines, injunctions and recalls of our products. Our loss or failure to obtain necessary permits and registrations could delay or prevent us from meeting customer demand, introducing new products, or implementing our growth plan.\nOur operations are also subject to extensive regulations administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, which, among other things, pertain to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes. Failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences, including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity. Future discovery of contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of our present or former facilities could require us to incur additional expenses. Any of these events could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn addition to the risk of regulatory enforcement actions, we are subject to risk of private legal claims arising out of our or our employees' failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including claims such as those described in \"Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies\" of this report. Trends in litigation may include class actions by consumers, shareholders, employees or injured persons, and claims relating to commercial, labor, employment, antitrust, securities or environmental matters.\nAlthough we believe we have implemented strict compliance programs and policies, along with effective internal controls to guard against intentional and unintentional violations of law by our personnel, contractors and agents, we cannot assure you that such persons will not violate our policies or the law, or be alleged to have done so. Our failure to maintain effective control processes or to strictly enforce our policies may prevent us from detecting and preventing violations of law. Defending regulatory enforcement actions and private litigation may be costly, and any adverse outcomes of actions or litigation against us could materially and adversely affect our reputation, results of operation and financial condition.\nWe are, and in the future may become, involved in legal proceedings related to our alleged violations of antitrust, securities fraud, and unfair competition and false advertising laws and, as a result, may incur substantial costs in connection with those proceedings.\nWe are involved in the legal proceedings that are described in detail in \"Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies.\" In general, those proceedings involve class actions and/or individual actions against us concerning:\n\u2022allegations that we and other poultry producers conspired to fix the price of broiler chickens in violation of state and federal antitrust laws, federal and state RICO laws, and other state laws;\n\u2022allegations that we and other poultry producers unlawfully conspired to suppress the compensation of broiler growers below competitive levels and to not solicit or hire broiler growers providing services for other poultry producers;\n\u2022allegations that we and other poultry producers unlawfully conspired to fix and depress the compensation paid to certain broiler chicken processing plant employees; and\n\u2022allegations that we are violating California unfair competition and false advertising laws by, among other things, representing that our poultry products are \u201c100% Natural\u201d and that our chickens were raised in \u201cnatural\u201d conditions.\nAdditionally, we are complying with a grand jury subpoena from the United States Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, and a civil investigative demand from the Attorney General of the State of Washington, in each case related to the antitrust litigation mentioned above, and a civil investigative demand from the Attorney General of the State of Florida related to the Georgia Dock price index for poultry products. We have also received a demand from a putative shareholder that we take action against current and former officers and directors for alleged breaches of their fiduciary duties related to the antitrust and securities fraud allegations described above.\nAn adverse resolution of any proceedings related to the matters summarized above and described in more detail in \"Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies\" could subject us to significant monetary damages and other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nFor additional information regarding the nature and status of these and other material legal proceedings, see \"Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies.\"\nEconomic Risk\nWeak or unstable national or global economic conditions could negatively impact our business.\nOur business may be adversely affected by:\n\u2022weak or volatile national or global economic conditions, including inflation;\n\u2022unfavorable currency exchange rates and interest rates;\n\u2022the lack of availability of credit on reasonable terms;\n\u2022restricted access to capital markets;\n\u2022changes in consumer spending rates and habits;\n\u2022unemployment and underemployment; and\n\u2022a tight energy supply and high energy costs.\nOur business could be negatively affected if efforts and initiatives of the governments of the United States and other countries to manage and stimulate the economy fail or result in worsening economic conditions. Deteriorating economic conditions could negatively affect consumer demand for protein generally or our products specifically, consumers\u2019 ability to afford our products, consumer habits with respect to how they spend their food dollars, and the cost and availability of raw materials we need.\nDisruptions in credit and other financial markets caused by deteriorating or weak national and international economic conditions could, among other things:\n\u2022make it more difficult for us, our customers or our growers or prospective growers to obtain financing and credit on reasonable terms;\n\u2022cause lenders to change their practice with respect to the industry generally or our company specifically in terms of granting credit extensions and terms;\n\u2022impair the financial condition of our customers, suppliers or growers making it difficult for them to meet their obligations and supply raw material; or\n\u2022impair the financial condition of our insurers, making it difficult or impossible for them to meet their obligations to us.\nCorporate Governance Risks\nOur business could be negatively impacted as a result of the actions of activist stockholders and others.\nWe occasionally receive shareholder proposals and voting recommendations from proxy advisory firms requesting changes to our business operations. Additionally, we are occasionally the target of media campaigns requesting changes to our business operations. Responding to such proposals and campaigns is costly and time-consuming, and may divert the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of our current business strategies. Additionally, implementing any changes in response could have the effect of increasing our operating costs, and result in capital expenditures to modify our facilities. We cannot assure you that we would be able to pass any such costs onto our customers. Accordingly, such activism could adversely affect our profitability, financial condition and results of operations.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter and by-laws, as well as certain provisions of Mississippi law, may make it difficult for anyone to acquire us without approval of our board of directors.\nOur articles of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that may discourage attempts to acquire control of our company without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions, among others, include a classified board of directors, advance notification requirements for stockholders to nominate persons for election to the board and to make stockholder proposals, and special stockholder voting requirements. These measures, and any others we may adopt in the future, as well as applicable provisions of Mississippi law, may discourage offers to acquire us and may permit our board of directors to choose not to entertain offers to purchase us, even offers that are at a substantial premium to the market price of our stock. Our stockholders may therefore be deprived of opportunities to profit from a sale of control of our company, and as a result, the marketability and market price of our common stock may be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 11343, "SIC": 2015, "TIC": "SAFM"}
