{"cik": "1333493", "company": "eHealth, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business as they may have a significant impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance should not be considered as a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf our ability to enroll individuals during enrollment periods is impeded or if investments we make in enrollment periods do not result in the returns we expected when making those investments, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nIn an attempt to attract and enroll a large number of individuals during the Medicare annual enrollment period and to a lesser extent, the Medicare Advantage open enrollment period and the health care reform open enrollment period under the Affordable Care Act, we may invest in areas of our business, including technology and content, customer care and enrollment, and marketing and advertising. We have in the past made investments in areas of our business in advance of enrollment periods that have not yielded the results we expected when making those investments. Any investment we make in any enrollment period may not result in a significant number of approved and paying members or may not be as cost-effective as we anticipated. If it does not, or is not, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed. If our ability to market and sell Medicare-related health insurance and individual and family health insurance is constrained during an enrollment period for any reason, such as technology failures, interruptions in the operation of our e-commerce or telephony platforms, reduced allocation of resources, any inability to timely employ, license, train, certify and retain our employees and our outsourced call centers and their health insurance agents to sell health insurance, we could acquire fewer members, suffer a reduction in our membership, and our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe may be unsuccessful in competing effectively against current and future competitors, including government-run health insurance exchanges.\nThe market for selling health insurance plans is highly competitive. We compete with government-run health insurance exchanges, among others, with respect to our sale of Medicare-related and individual and family health insurance. The federal government operates a website where Medicare beneficiaries can purchase Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans or be referred to carriers to purchase Medicare Supplement plans. We also compete with the original Medicare program. The Affordable Care Act exchanges have websites where individuals and small businesses can purchase health insurance, and they also have offline customer support and enrollment capabilities. Our competitors also include local insurance agents across the United States who sell health insurance plans in their communities, companies that advertise primarily through television, and companies that operate websites that provide quote information or the opportunity to purchase health insurance online, including lead aggregator services. Many health insurance carriers also directly market and sell their plans to consumers through call centers, Internet advertising and their own websites. Although we offer health insurance plans for many of these carriers, they also compete with us by offering their plans directly to consumers.\nTo remain competitive against our current and future competitors, we will need to market our services effectively and continue to improve the online shopping experience and functionalities of our website and other\nplatforms that our current and future customers may access to purchase health insurance products from us. If we cannot predict, develop and deliver the right shopping experience and functionality in a timely and cost-effective manner, or if we are not effective in cost-effectively driving a substantial number of consumers interested in purchasing health insurance to our website and customer care centers, we may not be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors and our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nSome of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. As compared to us, our current and future competitors may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns for their brands and services, devote more resources to website and systems development, negotiate more favorable commission rates and commission override payments, and make more attractive offers to potential employees, marketing partners and third-party service providers.\nCompetitive pressures from government-run health insurance exchanges and other competitors may result in our experiencing increased marketing costs, decreased demand and loss of market share, increased health insurance plan termination, reduction in our membership or revenue and may otherwise harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business may be harmed if we lose our relationship with health insurance carriers or our relationship with health insurance carriers is modified.\nWe typically enter into contractual relationships with health insurance carriers that are non-exclusive and terminable on short notice by either party for any reason. In many cases, health insurance carriers also may amend the terms of our agreements unilaterally, including commission rates, on short notice. Carriers may be unwilling to allow us to sell their existing or new health insurance plans, or desire to amend our agreements with them for a variety of reasons, including for competitive or regulatory reasons, dissatisfaction with the economics of the members that we place with them or because they do not want to be associated with our brand. The termination of our relationship with a health insurance carrier, the reduction of commission rates, or the amendment of or change in our relationship with a carrier could reduce the variety, quality and affordability of health insurance plans we offer, cause a loss of commission payments, including commissions for past and/or future sales, cause a reduction in the estimated constrained LTVs, we use for revenue recognition purposes, result in a loss of existing and potential members, adversely impact our profitability or have other adverse impacts, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nHealth insurance carriers can unilaterally amend the commission rates that they pay to us. For example, given the significant losses that carriers sustained in connection with their sale of individual and family health insurance as a result of health care reform, many health insurance carriers with which we have a relationship, including large national health insurance carriers, reduced or eliminated our commissions for selling individual and family health insurance, and in a limited number of cases, our renewal commissions. As a result, we experienced a meaningful reduction in our average commission rates for our aggregate individual and family health insurance plan membership. In addition, the reduction in contractual commission rates and these carriers\u2019 desire to not sell individual and family health insurance reduced the number of plans that we are able to offer on our websites, which resulted in less consumer demand for the individual and family health insurance that we sell and a reduction in our membership. In the future, health insurance carriers may decide to reduce our commissions, rely on their own internal distribution channels to sell their own plans, determine not to sell their plans or otherwise limit or prohibit us from selling their plans. In addition to reducing commission rates, health insurance carriers may determine to exit certain states or increase premiums to a significant degree, which could cause our members\u2019 health insurance to be terminated or our members to purchase new health insurance or determine not to pay for health insurance at all. If we lose these members, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur Medicare plan-related revenue is concentrated in a small number of health insurance carriers. The success of our Medicare-related health insurance business depends upon our ability to enter into new and maintain existing relationships with health insurance carriers on favorable economic terms. We expect that a small number of\nhealth insurance carriers will account for a significant portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future and any impairment of our relationship with, or the material financial impairment of, these health insurance carriers could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may also temporarily or permanently lose the ability to market and sell Medicare plans for one or more of our Medicare plan carriers. The regulations applicable to the business of selling Medicare-related health insurance are complex and frequently change. If we or our health insurance agents violate any of the requirements imposed by CMS, state laws or regulations, a health insurance carrier may terminate our relationship or CMS may penalize a health insurance carrier by suspending or terminating the carrier's ability to market and sell Medicare plans. Given the concentration of our Medicare plan sales in a small number of carriers, if we lose a relationship with a health insurance carrier to market their Medicare plans, even temporarily, or if the health insurance carrier loses its Medicare product membership, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nOur financial results will be adversely impacted if our membership does not grow or if we are not able to successfully retain our existing members and limit health insurance plan termination.\nWe receive commissions from health insurance carriers for health insurance plans sold through us. When one of these plans is canceled, or if we otherwise do not remain the agent on the plan, we no longer receive the related commission payment. Our members and/or health insurance carriers may choose to discontinue their health insurance plans for a variety of reasons. Consumers may also purchase individual and family and Medicare-related health insurance plans directly from other sources, such as our competitors, and we would not remain the agent on the policy and receive the related commission. Medicare Advantage plan and Medicare Part D prescription drug plan enrollees may select another plan during the Medicare annual enrollment period that occurs in the fourth quarter every year. Medicare Advantage plan enrollees may also select another plan during the Medicare Advantage open enrollment period that occurs in the first quarter of the year. In addition, certain individuals are permitted to enroll, disenroll or change their Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D prescription drug plans during special enrollment periods. We experienced an increased attrition rate in our Medicare Advantage and Medicare prescription drug plan membership in 2020 above historical levels prior to that time. While we have implemented measures to improve the attrition rate, if our Medicare Advantage and other health insurance plan termination rates do not decline in subsequent quarters, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed. In addition, enrollment periods could cause us to further experience increased termination rates in the future, which could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAny decrease in the amount of time we retain our members on the health insurance plans that they purchased through us could adversely impact the estimated constrained LTVs we use for purposes of recognizing revenue, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. For example, our Medicare Advantage plan and Medicare Part D prescription drug plan LTVs have been negatively impacted by increased plan termination rates. While we have recently placed a stronger operational focus on member retention, there are no assurances that investments we make to pursue retention initiatives will result in a decline in health insurance plan termination rate and/or improvement in our constrained LTVs in the future. If we are not able to successfully retain our existing members and limit health insurance plan termination, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed. If we experience higher health insurance plan termination rates than we estimated when we recognized commission revenue, we may not collect all of the related commissions receivable, which could result in a reduction in LTV and a write-off of contract assets - commissions receivable, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, the growth of our membership is highly dependent upon our success in attracting new members during the Medicare annual enrollment period and to a lesser extent, the Medicare Advantage open enrollment period and the health care reform open enrollment period. The Medicare-related commission rates that we receive may be higher in the first calendar year of a plan if the plan is the first Medicare-related plan issued to the member. Similarly, the individual and family plan commission rates that we receive are typically higher in the first twelve months of a policy. After the first twelve months, the commission rates generally decline significantly. As a result, if we do not add a sufficient number of members to new plans, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nIf we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our business and operating results will be harmed.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand identity is critical to our relationships with existing members, marketing partners and health insurance carriers and to our ability to attract new members, marketing partners and health insurance carriers. The promotion of our brand in these and other ways may require us to make substantial investments and we anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive, these branding initiatives may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Our brand promotion activities may not be successful or yield increased revenue, and to the extent that these activities yield increased revenue, the increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur and our operating results could be harmed. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brand, our business may not grow and we could lose our relationships with health insurance carriers, marketing partners and/or members, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and public health crises, illness, epidemics or pandemics could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nCOVID-19 and public health crises, illness, epidemics or pandemics, in general, and any associated disruption to our call center and service operations, in particular, could materially impact our business, operations and financial condition. In an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, and to comply with applicable government directives, we generally have directed employees to work from home and implemented new business protocols for employees who have resumed work in our offices. A potential COVID-19 infection of any of our employees could adversely impact our operations, including resulting in the sudden closure of any of our offices. Our business operations may be disrupted if key personnel or significant portions of our employees are unable to work effectively, especially if such disruption occurs during or in our preparation for the Medicare annual enrollment period. We have had to adjust our business operations, including onboarding and training new health insurance agents remotely and asking employees to work from home, which could cause operational difficulties, reduce the effectiveness of our agents in selling health insurance and impair our ability to manage our business. An increased number of employees in a remote work environment may exacerbate certain risks to our business, including an increased demand for information technology resources, increased risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks, and increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information about us or our customers or other third-parties. Our business operations and recruitment efforts could be impacted if government offices, including CMS and state departments of insurance, are adversely impacted by COVID-19 given that some of our marketing materials require CMS approval and health insurance agent licensing and licensing renewals are dependent on state department of insurance processing. Our product development initiatives could also be negatively impacted by extended office closures. Furthermore, if any of our health insurance carriers, business partners or vendors increase the prices of or become unable to continue to provide their products or services as a result of COVID-19, or if health insurance carriers reduce our commission rates or the amount they pay us, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed. The impact of COVID-19 to our Individual, Family and Small Business segment is especially uncertain because of increases in unemployment rate, potential delays in customer premium payments and/or health insurance carrier commission payments, potential changes to the open enrollment period, and potential changes to qualified health plans subsidies, among others. COVID-19 presents uncertainties and risks with respect to the demand for and pricing of health insurance plans, which could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nChanges in our management and key employees could affect our business and financial results.\nOur success is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel for all areas of our organization. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining personnel on a timely basis, on competitive terms or at all. If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary personnel, our business would be harmed. Our executive officers and employees can terminate their employment at any time. The transition and the departure of members of our senior management could result in attrition in our senior management and key personnel and any significant change in leadership over a short period of time could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe loss of the services of any of our executive officers or key employees could harm our business. For example, we are required to appoint a single designated writing agent with each insurance carrier. A small number of our employees act as writing agent and each employee that acts as writing agent does so for a number of carriers. When an employee that acts as writing agent terminates their employment with us, we need to replace such writing agent with another employee who has health insurance licenses. Due to our national reach and the large number of carriers whose plans are purchased by our members, the process of changing writing agents has in the past taken and could take a significant period of time to complete. If the transition is not successful, our ability to sell health insurance plans may be interrupted, our agency relationship with particular insurance carriers may be terminated, our commission payments could be discontinued or delayed and, as a result, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nOur business may be harmed if we are not successful in executing on our strategic investments and initiatives, including our growth strategy and retention initiatives.\nAs part of our strategy, we have determined to invest in initiatives to accelerate growth in our Medicare product sales, to enhance post-enrollment consumer engagement and increase customer retention, to increase online enrollment and enhance operating leverage, to expand our strategic partner relationships, improve our technology platform to optimize the consumer experience and relationship, and to utilize data analytics to increase the productivity of our customer care employees. Pursuing and investing in these and other initiatives we develop will require significant investments in marketing and advertising, technology and product offerings, and customer care and enrollment, among others, and involves risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this Risk Factors section, including the initiatives not achieving our retention, growth or profitability targets, inadequate return of capital on our investments, legal and regulatory compliance risks, potential changes in laws and regulations and other issues that could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our investments and incur unanticipated liabilities. Our pursuit of these strategic initiatives may not be successful. Our cash flow from operations is expected to be negative in the year ending December 31, 2021 and was negative in each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. If we are not successful in executing on our business strategy, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nSeasonality may cause fluctuations in our financial results.\nOpen enrollment periods drive the seasonality of our business. The Medicare annual enrollment period occurs from October 15 to December 7 each year and the individual and family health insurance open enrollment period typically runs from November 1 through December 15 each year. In addition, the Medicare Advantage open enrollment period, where Medicare-eligible individuals who enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan can switch to the original Medicare program or switch to a different Medicare Advantage plan, runs from January 1st through March 31st of each year. We experience an increase in the number of submitted Medicare-related applications and approved members during the fourth quarter and, to a lesser extent, in the first quarter, and an increase in Medicare plan related expense during the third and fourth quarters in connection with the open enrollment periods. In addition, we typically experience the highest plan termination rates from our Medicare Advantage plan members in the first year following the effective date of plan enrollment. If we experience significant growth in Medicare Advantage approved members resulting in an increased number of first year members as a percentage of our total estimated membership, we may also experience increased health insurance plan terminations in the year following such periods of growth.\nThe seasonality of our business could change in the future due to other factors, including as a result of changes in timing of the Medicare or individual and family health plan enrollment periods, adoption of new enrollment periods such as the COVID-related special enrollment period that was adopted in the second quarter of 2020, and changes in the laws and regulations that govern the sale of health insurance. We may not be able to timely adjust to changes in customer demand and the seasonality of our business. If we are not successful in responding to changes in the seasonality of our business, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nThe success of our customer care center operations depends upon our ability to timely hire, train, retain and ensure the productivity of our licensed health insurance agents.\nIn addition to our websites, we rely upon our customer care centers and, during the Medicare annual enrollment period, outsourced call centers to sell Medicare plans. The success of our customer care center operations is largely dependent on licensed health insurance agents and other employees. In order to sell Medicare-related health insurance plans, our health insurance agent employees and employees of outsourced call centers must be licensed by the states in which they are selling plans and certified and appointed with the health insurance carrier that offers the plans in each applicable state. Because a significant number of Medicare plans are sold in the fourth quarter each year during the Medicare annual enrollment period, we contract with outsourced call centers and hire additional employees on a temporary or seasonal basis in a limited period of time to address the expected increase in the volume of health insurance transactions during this period. We depend upon our employees, state departments of insurance, government exchanges and health insurance carriers for the licensing, certification and appointment of our health insurance agents. The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting containment measures have negatively impacted the capacity of health insurance license testing facilities and have caused delays in the completion of background checks and fingerprinting requirements. As a result, these health insurance agents may experience delays in obtaining health insurance licenses and certifications and health insurance carrier appointments. We and our outsourced call centers may experience difficulties hiring a sufficient number of additional licensed agents and retaining existing licensed agents for the Medicare annual enrollment period. If we and our outsourced call centers are not successful in these regards, our ability to sell Medicare-related health insurance plans will be impaired during the Medicare annual enrollment period, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nEven if we or our outsourced call centers are successful in hiring licensed health insurance agents, our success depends on the productivity of these health insurance agents. Health insurance agents may not perform to the standard we expect of them, which could result in lower than expected conversion rates and revenue, higher costs of acquisition per member and higher plan termination rates. We have observed that our health insurance agent employees are more productive than the employees of our outsourced call centers and that experienced health insurance agents are more productive than less-tenured health insurance agents. As a result, the success of our business depends upon our ability to retain existing health insurance agents and hiring and training a sufficient number of internal health insurance agent employees who can perform to the standard we expect of them. Failure to retain, train and ensure the productivity of our health insurance agent employees and employees of outsourced call centers would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nDuring the 2020 annual enrollment period, we experienced reduced conversion rates from health insurance agents that work at an outsourced call center, which impacted our revenue and cost of acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2020. As a result, we have determined to increase the number of our health insurance agent employees to a much more significant degree than we have in the past. Our ability to do so successfully will depend on the success of our recruiting efforts and our ability to train, license and appoint with carriers the newly employed agents so that they are effective in selling plans in time for the Medicare annual enrollment period occurring in 2021. If we are not successful in these efforts, we may need to rely more than we have planned on outsourced health insurance agents or rely on a fewer number of employed agents, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we are not successful in cost-effectively converting visitors to our website and customers who call into our call centers into members for whom we receive commissions, our business and operating results would be harmed.\nOur growth depends in large part upon growth in approved members in a given period. The rate at which consumers visiting our ecommerce platforms and customer care centers seeking to purchase health insurance are converted into approved members directly impacts our revenue. In addition, the rate at which consumers who are approved become paying members impacts the constrained LTV of our approved members, which impacts the revenue that we are able to recognize. A number of factors have influenced, and could in the future influence, these conversion rates for any given period, some of which are outside of our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022changes in consumer shopping behavior due to circumstances outside of our control, such as economic conditions, the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers\u2019 ability or willingness to pay for health insurance, adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, availability of unemployment benefits or proposed or enacted legislative or regulatory changes impacting our business, including health care reform;\n\u2022the quality of and changes to the consumer experience on our ecommerce platforms or with our customer care centers;\n\u2022regulatory requirements, including those that make the experience on our ecommerce platforms cumbersome or difficult to navigate or reduce the ability of consumers to purchase plans outside of enrollment periods;\n\u2022the variety, competitiveness and affordability of the health insurance plans that we offer;\n\u2022system failures or interruptions in the operation of our ecommerce platform or call center operations;\n\u2022changes in the mix of consumers who are referred to us through our direct, marketing partner and online advertising member acquisition channels;\n\u2022health insurance carriers offering the health insurance plans for which consumers have expressed interest, and the degree to which our technology is integrated with those carriers;\n\u2022health insurance carrier guidelines applicable to applications submitted by consumers, the amount of time a carrier takes to make a decision on that application and the percentage of submitted applications approved by health insurance carriers;\n\u2022the effectiveness of health insurance agents in assisting consumers, including the tenure of the health insurance agent and whether the health insurance agent is an employee or works with an outsourced call center with which we have a relationship; and\n\u2022our ability to enroll subsidy-eligible individuals in qualified health plans through government-run health insurance exchanges and the efficacy of the process we are required to use to do so.\nOur conversion rates can be impacted by changes in the mix of consumers referred to us through our member acquisition channels and whether they interact with a more seasoned health insurance agent or a health insurance agent that works with an outsourced call center. We may make changes to our ecommerce platforms in response to regulatory requirements or undertake other initiatives in an attempt to improve consumer experience or for other reasons. These changes have in the past, and may in the future have the unintended consequence of adversely impacting our conversion rates. A decline in the percentage of consumers who submit health insurance applications on our ecommerce platforms or telephonically via our customer care centers and are converted into approved and paying members could cause an increase in our cost of acquiring members on a per member basis and impact our revenue in any given period. To the extent the rate at which we convert consumers visiting our ecommerce platforms or telephonically via our customer care centers into members suffers, our membership may decline, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe depend upon Internet search engines and social media platforms to attract a significant portion of the consumers who visit our website, and if we are unable to effectively advertise on search engines or social media platforms on a cost-effective basis, our business and operating results would be harmed.\nWe derive a significant portion of our website traffic from consumers who search for health insurance through Internet search engines, such as Google, Bing and Yahoo!, and through social media platforms, such as Facebook. A critical factor in attracting consumers to our website is whether we are prominently displayed in response to an Internet search relating to health insurance or on a social media platform. Search engines typically provide two types of search results, algorithmic listings and paid advertisements. We rely on both to attract consumers to our websites and otherwise generate demand for our services.\nAlgorithmic search result listings are determined and displayed in accordance with a set of formulas or algorithms developed by the particular Internet search engine. The algorithms determine the order of the listing of results in response to the consumer\u2019s Internet search. From time to time, search engines revise these algorithms. In some instances, these modifications have caused our website to be listed less prominently in algorithmic search results, which has resulted in decreased traffic to our website. We may also be listed less prominently as a result of other factors, such as new websites, changes we make to our website or technical issues with the search engine itself. For example, government health insurance exchange websites appear prominently in algorithmic search results. In addition, search engines have deemed the practices of some companies to be inconsistent with search engine guidelines and decided not to list their website in search result listings at all. If we are listed less prominently in, or removed altogether from, search result listings for any reason, the traffic to our websites would decline and we may not be able to replace this traffic, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. If we decide to attempt to replace this traffic, we may be required to increase our marketing expenditures, which would also increase our cost of member acquisition and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe purchase paid advertisements on search engines and social media platforms in order to attract consumers to our platforms. We typically pay a search engine for prominent placement of our website when particular health insurance-related terms are searched for on the search engine, regardless of the algorithmic search result listings. The prominence of the placement of our advertisement is determined by a combination of factors, including the amount we are willing to pay and algorithms designed to determine the relevance of our paid advertisement to a particular search term. As with algorithmic search result listings, search engines may revise the algorithms relevant to paid advertisements, and websites other than our ecommerce platform may become more optimized for the algorithms. These changes may result in our having to pay increased amounts to maintain our paid advertisement placement in response to a particular search term. We could also have to pay increased amounts should the market share of major search engines continue to become more concentrated with a single search engine. Additionally, we bid against our competitors, insurance carriers, government health insurance exchanges and others for the display of these paid search engine or social media platform advertisements. We have experienced increased competition for both algorithmic search result listings and for paid advertisements, which competition increases substantially during the enrollment periods for Medicare related health insurance and for individual and family health insurance. The competition has increased the cost of paid internet search advertising and has increased our marketing and advertising expenses. If paid search advertising costs increase or become cost prohibitive, whether as a results of competition, algorithm changes or otherwise our advertising expenses could rise significantly or we could reduce or discontinue our paid search advertisements, either of which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe rely significantly on marketing partners and our business and operating results would be harmed if we are unable to maintain effective relationships with our existing marketing partners or if we do not establish successful relationships with new marketing partners.\nWe frequently enter into contractual marketing relationships with partners that drive consumers to our ecommerce platform and call centers. These marketing partners include financial and online services companies, affiliate organizations, online advertisers and content providers, and other marketing vendors. We also have relationships with strategic marketing partners, including hospitals and pharmacy chains that promote our Medicare platforms to their customers as well as pharmacy service providers and other affinity groups. We compensate many of our marketing partners for their referrals on a submitted health insurance application basis and, if they are\nlicensed to sell health insurance, may share a percentage of the commission we earn from the health insurance carrier for each member referred by the marketing partner. The success of our relationship is dependent on a number of factors, including but not limited to the continued positive market presence, reputation and growth of the marketing partner, the effectiveness of the marketing partner in marketing our website and services, the compliance of each marketing partner with applicable laws, regulations and guidelines, and the contractual terms we negotiate with our marketing partners, including the marketing fees we agree to pay.\nWhile we have relationships with a large number of marketing partners, we depend upon referrals from a limited number of marketing partners for a significant portion of the submitted applications we receive from our marketing partner customer acquisition channel. Given our reliance on our marketing partners, our business operating results and financial condition would be harmed if we are unable to maintain successful relationships with these companies, if we fail to establish successful relationships with new marketing partners, if we experience competition in our receipt of referrals from high volume marketing partners, and if we are required to pay increased amounts to our marketing partners.\nCompetition for referrals from our marketing partners has increased particularly during the enrollment periods for Medicare-related health insurance and individual and family health insurance. We may lose marketing partner referrals if our competitors pay marketing partners more than we do or be forced to pay increased fees to our marketing partners, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. If we lose marketing partner referrals during the Medicare or individual and family health insurance enrollment periods, the adverse impact on our business would be particularly pronounced. In addition, the promulgation of laws, regulations or guidelines, or the interpretation of existing laws, regulations and guidelines, by state departments of insurance or by CMS, could cause our relationships with our marketing partners to be in non-compliance with those laws, regulations and guidelines. We also have relationships with hospital systems and pharmacy chains that utilize aspects of our platform and tools. Our relationships with these hospital systems and pharmacy chains result in the referral of a significant number of individuals to us who are interested in purchasing Medicare-related health insurance plans. If CMS or state departments of insurance were to change existing laws, regulations or guidelines, or interpret existing laws, regulations or guidelines, to prohibit these arrangements, or if hospital systems or pharmacy partners otherwise decided to no longer utilize aspects of our platform and tools, we could experience a significant decline in the number of Medicare-eligible individuals who are referred to our platforms and customer care centers, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur future operating results are likely to fluctuate and could fall short of expectations.\nOur operating results are likely to fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including the factors described elsewhere in this Risk Factors section, many of which are outside of our control. For example and among these factors, the assumptions underlying our estimates of commission revenue as required by ASC 606 may vary significantly over time. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance, particularly in light of the fact that our business and industry are undergoing substantial change as a result of health care reform, competition and initiatives we determined to pursue. If our revenue or operating results differ from our guidance or fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. In the past, when our revenue and operating results differed from our guidance and the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock was impacted.\nIf commission reports we receive from carriers are inaccurate or not sent to us in a timely manner, our business and operating results could be harmed and we may not recognize trends in our membership.\nWe rely on health insurance carriers to timely and accurately report the amount of commissions earned by us, and we calculate our commission revenue, prepare our financial reports, projections and budgets and direct our marketing and other operating efforts based on the reports we receive from health insurance carriers. There have been instances where we have determined that plan cancellation data reported to us by a health insurance carrier has not been accurate. The extent to which health insurance carriers are inaccurate in their reporting of plan cancellations could cause us to change our cancellation estimates, which could adversely impact our revenue. We\nhave designed controls to assess the completeness and accuracy of the data received, whereby we apply judgment and make estimates based on historical data and current trends to independently determine whether or not carriers are accurately reporting commissions due to us. We also operate procedures with carriers on an ongoing basis whereby potential under or over reporting is reconciled and discrepancies are resolved. For instance, we reconcile information health insurance carriers provide to us and may determine that we were not historically paid commissions owed to us, which would cause us to have underestimated our membership. Conversely, health insurance carriers may require us to return commission payments paid in a prior period due to plan cancellations for members we previously estimated as being active. To the extent that health insurance carriers understate or fail to accurately report the amount of commissions due to us in a timely manner or at all, our estimates of constrained LTV may be adversely impacted, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, any inaccuracies in the reports would adversely impact our commission revenue for future periods which is based on historical trends, including trends relating to contracted commission rates and expected health insurance plan cancellation.\nWe do not receive information about membership cancellations from our health insurance carriers directly, which makes it difficult for us to determine the impact of current conditions on our membership retention and to accurately estimate membership as of a specific date.\nWe depend on health insurance carriers and others for data related to our membership. For instance, with respect to health insurance plans other than small business health insurance, health insurance carriers do not directly report member cancellations to us, resulting in the need for us to determine cancellations using payment data that carriers provide. We infer cancellations from this payment data by analyzing whether payments from members have ceased for a period of time, and we may not learn of a cancellation for several months. The majority of our members who terminate their plans do so by discontinuing their insurance premium payments to the health insurance carrier and do not inform us of the cancellation. With respect to our small business membership, many groups notify the carrier directly with respect to increases or decreases in group size and policy cancellations. Our insurance carrier partners often do not communicate this information to us, and it often takes a significant amount of time for us to learn about small business group cancellations and changes in our membership within the group itself. We often are not made aware of policy cancellations until the time of the group\u2019s annual renewal.\nGiven the number of months required to observe non-payment of commissions in order to confirm cancellations, we estimate the number of members who are active on health insurance plans as of a specified date. After we have estimated membership for a period, we may receive information from health insurance carriers that would have impacted the estimate if we had received the information prior to the date of estimation. We may receive commission payments or other information that indicates that a member who was not included in our estimates for a prior period was in fact an active member at that time, or that a member who was included in our estimates was in fact not an active member of ours. As a result of the Medicare annual enrollment and other open enrollment periods, we may not receive information from our carriers on as timely a basis due to the significant increase in health insurance transaction volume, which could impair the accuracy of our membership estimates. For these and other reasons, including if current trends in membership cancellation are inconsistent with past cancellation trends that we use to estimate our membership or if carriers subsequently report changes to the commission payments that they previously reported to us, our actual membership could be different from our estimates, perhaps materially. If our actual membership is different from our estimates, the constrained LTV component of our revenue recognition could also be inaccurate, including as a result of an inaccurate estimate of the average amount of time our members maintain their health insurance plans. As a result of the delay we experience in receiving information about our membership, it is difficult for us to determine with any certainty the impact of current conditions on our membership retention. For example, our estimated membership reported as of March 31, 2020 was higher than our actual membership, because we experienced increased membership cancellation compared to the historical cancellation rates we used to estimate our membership as of March 31, 2020. We were not able to observe the increased membership cancellations that occurred during the first quarter of 2020 until after we reported our estimated membership for the period. Various circumstances, including market-related factors such as changes in timing of enrollment periods and other factors specific to our business, could cause the assumptions and estimates that we make in connection with estimating our membership and constrained LTV to be inaccurate, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur carrier advertising and sponsorship business may not be successful.\nWe develop, host and maintain carrier dedicated Medicare plan websites and may undertake other marketing and advertising initiatives through our Medicare plan advertising program. We also allow health insurance carriers to purchase advertising space for non-Medicare products on our website through our sponsorship program. To the extent that economic conditions, health care reform or other factors impact the amount health insurance carriers are willing to pay for advertising, our advertising and sponsorship program will be adversely impacted. In addition, since we maintain relationships with a limited number of health insurance carriers to sell their Medicare plans, our Medicare plan-related advertising revenue is concentrated in a small number of health insurance carriers and our ability to generate Medicare plan-related advertising revenue would be harmed by the termination or non-renewal of any of these relationships as well as by a reduction in the amount a health insurance carrier is willing to pay for these services. Moreover, in light of the regulations applicable to the marketing and sale of Medicare plans, and given that these regulations are often unclear, change frequently and are subject to changing interpretations, we may in the future not be permitted to sell Medicare plan-related advertising. If we are not successful in generating Medicare plan-related advertising revenue, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nThe success of our sponsorship and advertising program depends on a number of factors, including the amount health insurance carriers are willing to pay for advertising, the effectiveness of the sponsorship and advertising program as a cost-effective method for carriers to obtain additional members, consumer demand for the health insurance carrier\u2019s product, our ability to attract consumers to our ecommerce platform or the dedicated Medicare plan websites and convert those consumers into members, and the cost, benefit and brand recognition of the health insurance plan that is the subject of the advertising, among others.\nOur business may be harmed if we do not enroll subsidy-eligible individuals through government-run health insurance exchanges efficiently.\nIn order to offer the qualified health plans that individuals and families must purchase to receive Affordable Care Act subsidies, agents and brokers must meet certain conditions, such as receiving permission to do so from the applicable government health insurance exchange, entering into an agreement with the health insurance exchange or a partner of the exchange, ensuring that the enrollment and subsidy application is completed through the health insurance exchange and complying with privacy, security and other standards. In the event Internet-based agents and brokers such as us use the Internet for completion of qualified health plan selection purposes, their websites are required to meet certain additional requirements. To the extent we enroll individuals and families into qualified health plans, we do so through the FFM, which runs all or part of the health insurance exchange in 36 states. We may experience difficulty in satisfying the conditions and requirements to offer qualified health plans to our existing members and new potential members, and in getting them enrolled through the FFM. If we are not able to satisfy these conditions and requirements, or if we are not able to successfully adopt and maintain solutions that allow us to enroll large numbers of individuals and families in qualified plans over the Internet both during and outside of open enrollment periods, we will lose existing members and new members, and may incur additional expense, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Beginning in the open enrollment period that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2018, CMS adopted a new enhanced direct enrollment pathway for CMS-approved partners to enroll individuals into qualified health plans and complete all steps in the eligibility and enrollment process on a single website. Before enhanced direct enrollment partners are approved, extensive security and privacy reviews are conducted by an independent third-party auditor and CMS reviews the audit results to ensure the entity satisfies numerous additional privacy and security standards. We entered into an agreement to outsource certain aspects of the enrollment process for qualified health plans to a third party in light of the expense and burden associated with the additional requirements. However, if we do not develop the ability to satisfy the requirements to use the improved qualified health plan enrollment process in the future, or if we are unsuccessful in entering into or maintaining a relationship with a third party who is approved to use the process, we may not be able to enroll individuals into qualified health plans through the FFM or could be required to use an inferior process to do so, which could cause a reduction in our individual and family health insurance plan membership and commission revenue. In addition, if we are not able to adopt or contract with and maintain solutions to integrate with government-run health insurance exchanges or if the health insurance exchange websites and other processes are unstable or not consumer friendly, efficient and compatible with the process we have adopted for enrolling\nindividuals and families into qualified health plans through the exchanges, we would not be successful in retaining and acquiring members, and our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed. The FFM may at any time cease allowing us to enroll individuals in qualified health plans or change the requirements for doing so. If it does so or if the FFM platform does not function properly, our ability to retain existing members and add new members could be negatively impacted, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThere are many risks associated with our operations in China.\nA portion of our operations is conducted by our subsidiary in China. Among other things, we use employees in China to maintain and update our ecommerce platform and perform certain tasks within our finance and customer care and enrollment functions. We rely on the Internet to communicate with our subsidiary in China. Our business would be harmed if our ability to communicate over the Internet with these employees failed, and we were prevented from promptly updating our software or implementing other changes to our database and systems, among other things. From time-to-time we receive inquiries from health insurance carriers relating to our operations in China and the security measures we have implemented to protect data that our employees in China may be able to access. As a part of these inquiries, we have implemented additional security measures relating to our operations in China. We may be required to implement further security measures to continue aspects of our operations in China or health insurance carriers may require us to bring aspects of our operations in China back to the United States, which could be time consuming and expensive and harm our operating results and financial condition. Health insurance carriers may also terminate our relationship due to concerns surrounding protection of data that our employees in China are able to access, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur operations in China also expose us to different and unfamiliar laws, rules and regulations, including different intellectual property laws, which are not as protective of our intellectual property as the laws in the United States. United States and Chinese trade laws may also impose restrictions on the importation of programming or technology to or from the United States. We are also subject to anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, privacy and data security laws, labor laws, tax laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions in China. On June 1, 2017, a national cybersecurity law came into effect in China. The law, along with its implementation regulations, applies to the establishment, operation, maintenance and usage of networks within China and the supervision and management of cybersecurity. Under the law, network operators are required to comply with certain tiered security obligations based on the networks\u2019 relative impact on national security, social order, public interest and individuals\u2019 privacy rights. There remains considerable uncertainty as to how the cybersecurity law will be applied, and the regulatory environment continues to evolve with new draft regulations and standards published frequently. Such laws, regulations and standards are complex, ambiguous and subject to change or interpretation, which create uncertainty regarding compliance. Pursuant to the draft regulations, we may be required to perform self-assessments, obtain third party certifications, report cybersecurity incidents and make filings with public security authorities. We could also be subject to security inspections and evaluations by public security authorities and be restricted to use only network products and services that meet certain standards based on the level of risk applicable to us. Compliance with these laws and regulations could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business operations in China. Violation of applicable laws and regulations could adversely affect our brand, affect our relationship with our health insurance carriers, and could result in regulatory enforcement actions and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties and fines, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by changes in China\u2019s economic or political condition. We have experienced greater competition for qualified personnel in China, which has raised market salaries and increased our compensation costs related to employees in China. If competition for personnel increases further, our compensation expenses could rise considerably or, if we determine to not increase compensation levels, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel in China may be impaired, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. These risks could cause us to incur increased expenses and could harm our ability to effectively and successfully manage our operations in China. Moreover, any significant or prolonged deterioration in the relationship between United States and China could adversely affect our operations in China. Certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in China are solely within the control of the Chinese government, and Chinese law regulates the scope of our foreign investments and business conducted within China. The escalation of trade tensions\ninitiated by the current administration has increased the risk associated with our operations in China. Either the United States or the Chinese government may sever our ability to communicate with our China operations or may take actions that force us to close our operations in China. We employ a large number of our technology and content employees in China, and we have other employees in China that support our business. Any sudden disruption of our operations in China would adversely impact our business. If we are required to move aspects of our operations from China to our offices in the United States as a result of political instability, changes in laws, inquiries from health insurance carriers or for other reasons, we could incur increased expenses, and our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe cannot predict the impact that changing climate conditions, including legal, regulatory and social responses thereto, may have on our business.\nGlobal climate change has added, and will continue to add, to the unpredictability, frequency and severity of natural disasters, including but not limited to hurricanes, tornadoes, freezes, droughts, other storms and fires in certain parts of the world. In response, a number of legal and regulatory measures and social initiatives have been introduced in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas and other carbon emissions that are chief contributors to global climate change. We cannot predict the impact that changing climate conditions will have on our business, though extreme weather events could impact our facilities, technological assets, business continuity and reputation. The legal, regulatory and social responses to climate change could also adversely affect our results of business, operating results and financial conditions.\nOur success in selling Medicare-related health insurance will depend upon a number of factors some of which are outside of our control.\nOur success in selling Medicare-related health insurance is dependent upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022our ability to continue to adapt our ecommerce platforms to market Medicare plans, including our development or acquisition of marketing tools and features important in the sale of Medicare plans online and the effective modification of our user experience;\n\u2022our success in marketing to Medicare-eligible individuals, including television advertising, online marketing and direct mail marketing, and in entering into and maintaining marketing partner relationships to drive Medicare-eligible individuals to our ecommerce platforms or customer care centers on a cost-effective basis;\n\u2022our ability to hire and retain additional employees with experience in Medicare, including our ability to timely implement Medicare sales expertise into our customer care centers;\n\u2022our ability to implement and maintain an effective information technology infrastructure for the sale of Medicare plans, including the infrastructure and systems that support our websites, call centers and call recording;\n\u2022our ability to leverage technology in order to sell, and otherwise become more efficient at selling, Medicare-related plans over the telephone;\n\u2022our ability to comply with the numerous, complex and changing laws, regulations, guidelines and policies of the federal and state government, including CMS guidelines and policies relating to the marketing and sale of Medicare plans and health care reform; and\n\u2022the effectiveness with which our competitors market the availability of Medicare plans from sources other than our ecommerce platforms.\nAs a result of these factors, we may prove unsuccessful in marketing Medicare plans and acting as a health insurance agent in connection with their sale, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, if our efforts to market Medicare plans during enrollment periods were impeded due to lack of timely health insurance carrier or CMS approval, or for other reasons, the impact on our business, operating\nresults and financial condition would be significantly greater given the seasonality of our Medicare-related revenue, membership acquisition and expenses and the fact that much of the sales of Medicare plans occur during this period.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nThe marketing and sale of Medicare plans are subject to numerous, complex and frequently changing laws, regulations and guidelines, and non-compliance with or changes in laws, regulations and guidelines could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe marketing and sale of Medicare plans are subject to numerous laws, regulations and guidelines at the federal and state level. The marketing and sale of Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans are principally regulated by the CMS but are also subject to state laws. The marketing and sale of Medicare Supplement plans are principally regulated on a state-by-state basis by state departments of insurance. The laws and regulations applicable to the marketing and sale of Medicare plans are numerous, ambiguous and complex, and, particularly with respect to regulations and guidance issued by CMS for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans, change frequently. We have altered, and likely will have to continue to alter, our marketing and sales process to comply with these laws, regulations and guidelines.\nHealth insurance carriers whose Medicare plans we sell approve our websites, our call center scripts and some of our marketing material. We must receive these approvals in order for us market and sell Medicare plans to Medicare-eligible individuals as a health insurance agent. We are also required to file many of these materials on a regular basis with CMS. In addition, certain aspects of our Medicare plan marketing partner relationships have been in the past, and will be in the future, subjected to CMS and health insurance carrier review. CMS, state departments of insurance or health insurance carriers may determine to object to or not to approve aspects of our online platforms, sales function or marketing material and processes and may determine that certain existing aspects of our Medicare-related business are not in compliance with legal requirements. Health insurance carriers may terminate our relationship with them or take other corrective action if our Medicare product sales, marketing and operations are not in compliance or give rise to too many complaints. The termination of or change in our relationship with health insurance carriers for this reason would reduce the products we are able to offer, could result in the loss of commissions for past and future sales and would otherwise harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Changes to the laws, regulations and guidelines relating to the sale of Medicare plans, their interpretation or the manner in which they are enforced could impact the manner in which we conduct our Medicare business, our ecommerce platforms or our sale of Medicare plans, or we could be prevented from operating aspects of our Medicare revenue generating activities altogether, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. We have received, and may in the future receive, inquiries from CMS or state departments of insurance regarding our marketing and business practices and compliance with laws and regulations. Inquiries and proceedings initiated by the government could adversely impact our health insurance licenses, require us to pay fines, require us to modify marketing and business practices, result in litigation and otherwise harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\nChanges and developments in the health insurance industry or system as a result of health care reform could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe United States health insurance system is subject to a changing regulatory environment. The future financial performance of our business will depend in part on our ability to adapt to regulatory developments. For example, the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and related regulatory reforms have and will continue to change the industry in which we operate in substantial ways. The implementation of health care reform has increased, and could further increase, our competition in the individual and family health insurance market, reduce demand for the health insurance for individuals and families that we sell, decrease the number of health insurance plans that we sell as well as the number of health insurance carriers offering them, cause carriers to increase premiums or reduce commissions and other amounts they pay for our services, any of which could materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition. These and other impacts of health care reform caused a significant decline in our individual and family plan and revenue membership and other changes in the future could have a similar impact on our Medicare related health insurance business. Our business, operating\nresults, financial condition and prospects may be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to adapt to developments in healthcare reform in the United States.\nThe Affordable Care Act contains a mandate requiring individuals to maintain health insurance plans that comply with the Affordable Care Act or face a tax penalty. As a part of the tax reform law that came into effect in December 2017, the tax penalty for violating the mandate was set at zero effective in 2019, essentially repealing it. The essential repeal of the individual mandate could cause individuals to determine not to purchase or maintain individual and family health insurance and could cause carriers to increase premiums, reduce commissions or exit the business of selling individual and family health insurance, any of which would adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSince the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the law. In December 2018, a federal district court in Texas determined that the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional, because it was not within Congress\u2019s tax power or interstate commerce power. It also determined that the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act were inseverable and therefore invalid. The court, however, did not rule that the operation of the Affordable Care Act be enjoined, so the law continues to operate until determined otherwise by the court or an appellate court. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the district court that the mandate is unconstitutional, but remanded the case back to the district court to address whether the unconstitutionality of the mandate should impact the rest of the law. In March 2020, the Supreme Court agreed to review the case, including whether the individual mandate is unconstitutional, and if the mandate is unconstitutional whether the rest of the Affordable Care Act can survive. Oral argument of the case before the Supreme Court occurred and we are awaiting the court's decision. If the Affordable Care Act were finally determined to be unconstitutional and no longer operated, it is unclear what impact it or its replacement would have on our business. However, it or its replacement could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business depends upon the private sector of the United States health insurance system, which is subject to a changing environment. Changes and developments in the health insurance system in the United States could reduce demand for our services and harm our business. Ongoing healthcare reform efforts and measures may expand the role of government-sponsored coverage, including single payer or so called \u201cMedicare-for-All\u201d proposals, which could have far-reaching implications for the health insurance industry if enacted. Some proposals would seek to eliminate the private marketplace, while others would expand a government-sponsored option to a larger population. We are unable to predict the full impact of healthcare reform initiatives on our operations in light of the uncertainty of whether initiatives will be successful and the uncertainty regarding the terms and timing of any provisions enacted and the impact of any of those provisions on various healthcare and insurance industry participants. Changes to the health insurance system as a result of the change in the balance of power in Congress or as a result of the Biden administration could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In the event that laws, regulations or rules that eliminate or reduce private sources of health insurance are adopted, the demand for our products could be adversely impacted and our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nFrom time to time we are subject to various legal proceedings which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are, and may in the future become, involved in various legal proceedings and governmental inquiries, including labor and employment-related claims, claims relating to our marketing or sale of health insurance, intellectual property claims and claims relating to our compliance with securities laws. Any claims asserted against us, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to settle or litigate and divert management\u2019s attention and other resources. These claims also could subject us to significant liability for damages and harm our reputation. Our insurance and indemnities may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us. If we are unsuccessful in our defense in these legal proceedings, we may be forced to pay damages or fines, enter into consent decrees, stop offering our services or change our business practices, any of which would harm our business, operating results or financial condition.\nOur success in selling health insurance is dependent in part on the actions of federal and state governments. Changes in the laws and regulations governing the offer, sale and purchase of health insurance could harm our business and operating results.\nThe laws and regulations governing the offer, sale and purchase of health insurance are complex and subject to change, and future changes may be adverse to our business. For example, a long-standing provision in most applicable state laws that we believe is advantageous to our business is that once health insurance premiums are set by the carrier and approved by state regulators, they are fixed and not generally subject to negotiation or discounting by insurance companies or agents. Additionally, state regulations generally prohibit carriers, agents and brokers from providing financial incentives, such as rebates, to their members in connection with the sale of health insurance. As a result, we do not currently compete with carriers or other agents and brokers on the price of the health insurance plans offered on our website. If these regulations change, we could be forced to reduce prices or provide rebates or other incentives for the health insurance plans sold through our ecommerce platform, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, a federal law was recently passed that requires disclosure of commissions paid to us to the purchaser of small business, major medical individual and family and short-term health insurance plans. The provisions of the law have not gone into effect. It is unclear what impact the law will have when it goes into effect, but it could cause health insurance carriers to lower our commission rates, which could reduce our revenue.\nStates and federal governments may adopt laws and regulations that are adverse to our business, including laws and regulations that impact the types of health insurance coverage available to consumers, the product features and benefits, our marketing and selling of plans and the role and compensation of agents and brokers in the sale of health insurance.\nChanges to the rules and regulations that apply to our sale of Medicare related health insurance are more likely given that the Biden administration recently took office. CMS may change the rules and regulations applicable to us in connection with our Medicare plan business, and those changes could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. The Biden administration has also indicated that it is in support of changes to the Affordable Care Act. It is difficult to predict what changes the Biden administration may make in the rules and regulations relating to our sale of the products that we sell, but the changes could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we fail to comply with the numerous state insurance laws and regulations that are applicable to the sale of health insurance, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nWe are required to maintain a valid license in each state in which we transact health insurance business and to adhere to sales, documentation and administration practices specific to that state. We must maintain our health insurance licenses to continue selling plans and to continue to receive commissions from health insurance carriers. In addition, each employee who transacts health insurance business on our behalf must maintain a valid license in one or more states. Because we do business in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, compliance with health insurance-related laws, rules and regulations is difficult and imposes significant costs on our business. Each jurisdiction\u2019s insurance department typically has the power, among other things, to:\n\u2022grant, limit, suspend and revoke licenses to transact insurance business;\n\u2022conduct inquiries into the insurance-related activities and conduct of agents and agencies;\n\u2022require and regulate disclosure in connection with the sale and solicitation of health insurance;\n\u2022authorize how, by which personnel and under what circumstances insurance premiums can be quoted and published and an insurance policy sold;\n\u2022approve which entities can be paid commissions from carriers and the circumstances under which they may be paid;\n\u2022regulate the content of insurance-related advertisements, including web pages, and other marketing practices;\n\u2022approve policy forms, require specific benefits and benefit levels and regulate premium rates;\n\u2022impose fines and other penalties; and\n\u2022impose continuing education requirements.\nDue to the complexity, periodic modification and differing interpretations of state insurance laws and regulations, we may not have always been, and we may not always be, in compliance with them. New state insurance laws, regulations and guidelines also may not be compatible with the sale of health insurance over the Internet or with various aspects of our platform or manner of marketing or selling health insurance plans. Failure to comply with insurance laws, regulations and guidelines or other laws and regulations applicable to our business could result in significant liability, additional department of insurance licensing requirements, required modification of our advertising and business practices, changes to our existing technology or platforms, the limitation, suspension and/or revocation of our licenses in a particular jurisdiction, termination of our relationship with health insurance carriers or loss of commissions and/or our inability to sell health insurance plans, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Moreover, an adverse regulatory action in one jurisdiction could result in penalties and adversely affect our license status, business or reputation in other jurisdictions due to the requirement that adverse regulatory actions in one jurisdiction be reported to other jurisdictions. Even if the allegations in any regulatory or other action against us are proven false, any surrounding negative publicity could harm consumer, marketing partner or health insurance carrier confidence in us, which could significantly damage our brand.\nOur business is subject to security risks and, if we experience cyberattacks, security breaches or are otherwise unable to safeguard the security and privacy of confidential data, including personal health information, our business will be harmed.\nOur services involve the collection and storage of confidential and personally identifiable information of consumers and the transmission of this information to their chosen health insurance carriers and to government. For example, we collect names, addresses, credit card and social security numbers and protected health information such as information regarding the medical history of consumers. As a result, we are subject to various laws and regulations and contractual requirements regarding the collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information. We also hold a significant amount of information relating to our current and former employees. We cannot guarantee that our facilities and systems, and those of our third party service providers, will be free of security breaches, cyberattacks, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, malware, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Compliance with privacy and security laws, requirements and regulations, particularly new state legislation such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, may result in cost increases due to new constraints on our business, the development of new processes, the effects of potential non-compliance by us or third party service providers, and enforcement actions. We may be required to expend significant amounts and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by security breaches. Despite our implementation of security measures, techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Additionally, our third party service providers may cause security breaches for which we are responsible.\nAny compromise or perceived compromise of our security or the security of one of our vendors could damage our reputation, cause the termination of relationships with government-run health insurance exchanges and our members, marketing partners and health insurance carriers, reduce demand for our services and subject us to significant liability and expense as well as regulatory action and lawsuits, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. The COVID-19 pandemic generally is increasing the attack surface available to criminals, as more companies and individuals work remotely and otherwise work online. Consequently, the risk of a cybersecurity incident has increased. We cannot provide assurances that our preventative efforts, or those of our vendors or service providers, will be successful. In addition, in the event that additional data security laws are implemented, or our health insurance carrier or other partners determine to impose requirements on us relating to\ndata security, we may not be able to timely comply with such requirements or such requirements may not be compatible with our current processes. Changing our processes could be time consuming and expensive, and failure to timely implement required changes could result in our inability to sell health insurance plans in a particular jurisdiction or for a particular health insurance carrier or subject us to liability for non-compliance, any of which would damage our business, operating results and financial condition. For instance, health insurance carriers may require us to be compliant with additional security standards in order to accept credit card information from consumers or require us to comply with additional privacy and security standards to do business with us at all. Compliance with privacy and security standards is regularly assessed, and we may not always be compliant with the standards. If we are not in compliance, we may not be able to accept credit card information from consumers or conduct health insurance business, and our relationship with health insurance carriers could be adversely impacted or terminated, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAny legal liability, regulatory penalties, or negative publicity for the information on our website or that we otherwise provide could harm our business and operating results.\nWe provide information on our website, through our customer care centers, in our marketing materials and in other ways regarding health insurance in general and the health insurance plans we market and sell, including information relating to insurance premiums, coverage, benefits, provider networks, exclusions, limitations, availability, plan comparisons and insurance company ratings. A significant amount of both automated and manual effort is required to maintain the considerable amount of insurance plan information on our website. We also use the information provided on our website and otherwise collected by us to publish reports designed to educate consumers, facilitate public debate, and facilitate reform at the state and federal level. If the information we provide on our website, through our customer care centers, in our marketing materials or otherwise is not accurate or is construed as misleading, or if we do not properly assist individuals and businesses in purchasing health insurance, members, health insurance carriers and others could attempt to hold us liable for damages, our relationships with health insurance carriers could be terminated or impaired and regulators could attempt to subject us to penalties, force us to stop using our websites, marketing material or certain aspects of them, revoke our licenses to transact health insurance business in a particular jurisdiction, and/or compromise the status of our licenses to transact health insurance business in other jurisdictions, which could result in our loss of our commission revenue and harm our business, operating results and financial condition. In the ordinary course of operating our business, we have received complaints that the information we provided was not accurate or was misleading. We have received, and may in the future receive, inquiries from CMS or state departments of insurance regarding our marketing and business practices and compliance with laws and regulations. Although in the past we have resolved these complaints and governmental inquiries without significant financial cost or impact to our brand or reputation, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future. Our sales of short-term health insurance plans that lack the same benefits as major medical health insurance plans may increase the risk that we receive complaints regarding our marketing and business practices due to the potential for consumer confusion between short-term health insurance and major medical health insurance. In addition, these types of claims could be time-consuming and expensive to defend, could divert our management\u2019s attention and other resources, and could cause a loss of confidence in our services. As a result, whether or not we are able to successfully resolve these claims, they could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business could be harmed if we are unable to contact our consumers or market the availability of our products through specific channels.\nWe use email and telephone, among other channels, to market our services to potential members and as the primary means of communicating with our existing members. The laws and regulations governing the use of email and telephone calls for marketing purposes continue to evolve, and changes in technology, the marketplace or consumer preferences may lead to the adoption of additional laws or regulations or changes in interpretation of existing laws or regulations. If new laws or regulations are adopted, or existing laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced, to impose additional restrictions on our ability to send email or telephone messages to our members or potential members, we may not be able to communicate with them in a cost-effective manner. In addition to legal restrictions on the use of email, Internet service providers, e-mail service providers and others attempt to block the transmission of unsolicited email, commonly known as \u201cspam.\u201d Many Internet and e-mail service providers have relationships with organizations whose purpose it is to detect and notify the Internet and e-mail service providers of entities that the organization believes is sending unsolicited e-mail. If an Internet or e-mail service provider\nidentifies email from us as \u201cspam\u201d as a result of reports from these organizations or otherwise, we can be placed on a restricted list that will block our email to members or potential members.\nWe use telephones to communicate with customers and prospective customers and some of these communications may be subject to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, and other telemarketing laws. The TCPA and other laws, including state laws, relating to telemarketing restrict our ability to market using the telephone in certain respects. For instance, the TCPA prohibits us from using an automatic telephone dialing system to make certain telephone calls to consumers without prior express consent. We have policies in place to comply with the TCPA and other telemarketing laws. However, despite our legal compliance, we have in the past and may in the future become subject to claims that we have violated the TCPA. The TCPA provides for statutory damages of $500 for each violation and $1,500 for each willful violation. In the event that we were found to have violated the TCPA, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. In addition, telephone carriers may block or put consumer warnings on calls originating from call centers. Consumers increasingly screen their incoming emails and telephone calls, including by using screening tools and warnings, and therefore our members or potential members may not reliably receive our emails or telephone messages. If we are unable to communicate effectively by email or telephone with our members and potential members as a result of legislation, blockage, screening technologies or otherwise, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nRisks Related to Finance, Accounting and Tax Matters\nOur operating results will be impacted by factors that impact our estimate of the constrained LTV of commissions per approved member.\nEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). As a result of the adoption of ASC 606, we recognize revenue for plans approved during the period by applying the latest estimated constrained LTVs for that product. Constrained LTVs are estimates and are based on a number of assumptions, which include, but are not limited to, estimates of the conversion rates of approved members into paying members, forecasted average plan duration and forecasted commission rates we expect to receive per approved member's plan. These assumptions are based on historical trends and require significant judgment by our management in interpreting those trends and in applying the constraints. Changes in our historical trends will result in changes to our constrained LTV estimates in future periods and therefore could adversely affect our revenue and financial results in those future periods. As a result, negative changes in the factors upon which we estimate constrained LTVs, such as reduced conversion of approved members to paying members, increased health insurance plan terminations or a reduction in the lifetime commission amounts we expect to receive for selling the plan to a member or other changes could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. Changes in LTV may result in an increase or a decrease to revenue and a corresponding increase or decrease to commission receivables. In addition, if we ultimately receive commission payments that are less than the amount we estimated when we recognized commission revenue, we would need to write off the remaining commission receivable balance, which would adversely impact our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe rate at which approved members become paying members is a significant factor in our estimation of constrained LTVs. To the extent we experience a decline in the rate at which approved members turn into our paying members, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be harmed.\nThe forecasted average plan duration is another important factor in our estimation of constrained LTV. We receive commissions from health insurance carriers for health insurance plans sold through us. When one of these plans is canceled, or if we otherwise do not remain the agent on the policy, we no longer receive the related commission payment. Our forecasted average plan duration and health insurance plan termination rate are calculated based on our historical data by plan type. As a result, a reduction in our forecasted average plan duration or an inability to produce accurate forecasted average plan duration may adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nCommission rates are also a significant factor in our estimation of constrained LTVs. The commission rates we receive are impacted by a variety of factors, including the particular health insurance plans chosen by our\nmembers, the carriers offering those plans, our members\u2019 states of residence, the laws and regulations in those jurisdictions, the average premiums of plans purchased through us and health care reform. Our commission revenue per member has in the past decreased, and could in the future decrease, as a result of reductions in contractual commission rates, a change in the mix of carriers whose products we sell during a given period, and increased health insurance plan termination rates, all of which are beyond our control and may occur on short notice. To the extent these and other factors cause our commission revenue per member to decline, our revenue may decline and our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed. Given that Medicare-related and individual and family health insurance purchasing is concentrated during enrollment periods, we may experience a shift in the mix of Medicare-related and individual and family health insurance products selected by our members over a short period of time. Any reduction in our average commission revenue per member caused by such a shift or otherwise would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe determination of constraints is also a factor that requires significant management judgment. Constraints are applied to LTVs for revenue recognition purposes and help ensure that the total estimated lifetime commissions expected to be collected from an approved member's plan are recognized as revenue only to the extent that is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with future commissions receivable from the plan is subsequently resolved. We determine the constraint for each product by comparing prior calculations of LTV to actual cash received and review the reasons for any variations. We then apply judgment in assessing whether the difference between historical cash collections and LTV is representative of differences that can be expected in future periods. We also analyze whether circumstances have changed and consider any known or potential modifications to the inputs into LTV in light of the factors that can impact the amount of cash expected to be collected in future periods including but not limited to commission rates, carrier mix, plan duration, changes in laws and regulations, and cancellations of insurance plans offered by health insurance carriers with which we have a relationship. We evaluate the appropriateness of our constraints on an ongoing basis, and we update our assumptions when we observe a sufficient amount of evidence that would suggest that the long-term expectation underlying the assumptions has changed. If we underestimate the initial constraint applied to LTVs, we might be required to increase the constraint or record an impairment in a future period which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe closing of the financing transaction with the purchaser of our Series A preferred stock is subject to terms and conditions, many of which are outside our control. We may experience delays and difficulties with the closing of the transaction and no assurance can be given that it will close. The failure to close the transaction could adversely impact our future liquidity and our financial condition.\nOn February 17, 2021, we entered into an investment agreement pursuant to which we have agreed to issue to a purchaser at closing, 2,250,000 shares of our newly designated Series A preferred stock at an aggregate purchase price of $225 million (the \u201cPrivate Placement\u201d). The Private Placement is subject to closing conditions, including, among others: (i) the expiration or early termination of the waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Private Placement under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; (ii) the confirmation by Nasdaq that it has no objection to the terms and conditions of the Private Placement; and (iii) the determination that consummation of the Private Placement would not cause our outside auditor to no longer be deemed independent under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. While we intend to actively pursue the steps necessary to fulfill our closing conditions, some of the conditions are outside of our control and it is possible that not all of the closing conditions to the Private Placement will be satisfied. The failure to close the Private Placement could adversely impact our future liquidity and financial condition.\nThe issuance of shares of our Series A preferred stock dilutes the ownership and relative voting power of holders of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAs of February 17, 2021, the common stock to be issued to the purchaser of our Series A preferred stock upon closing of the transaction in the Private Placement represent approximately 8.8% of our outstanding common stock on an as-converted basis. The Series A preferred stock is convertible at the option of the holders at any time after May 31, 2021 into shares of common stock based on the conversion rate set forth in the certificate of\ndesignations for the Series A preferred stock, which conversion would dilute the ownership interest of existing holders of our common stock. In addition, because holders of our Series A preferred stock are entitled to vote, on an as-converted basis, together with holders of our common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of the holders of our common stock, the issuance of the Series A preferred stock effectively reduces the relative voting power of the holders of our common stock.\nAny sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A preferred stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. Pursuant to the investment agreement, holders of our Series A preferred stock will receive customary resale registration rights for common stock issued upon conversion of the Series A preferred stock upon closing. Any resale of our common stock would increase the number of shares of our common stock available for public trading. Sales by our Series A preferred stockholder of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales might occur, could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nOur Series A preferred stock has rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of our common stockholders, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, result in the interests of holders of our Series A preferred stock differing from those of our common stockholders and make an acquisition of us more difficult.\nHolders of our Series A preferred stock have (i) a liquidation preference (ii) rights to dividends, which are senior to all of our other equity securities, (iii) redemption rights on or after the sixth anniversary of the closing of the Private Placement and (iv) the right to require us to repurchase any or all of their Series A preferred stock in connection with certain change of control events, each subject to the terms, conditions and exceptions contained in the certificate of designations.\nThese dividend and share repurchase and redemption obligations could impact our liquidity and reduce the amount of cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, growth opportunities, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes. Our obligations to the purchaser of our Series A Preferred Stock, as the initial holder of our Series A preferred stock, could also limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. The preferential rights could also result in divergent interests between the Series A preferred stockholder and holders of our common stock. Furthermore, a sale of our company, as a change of control event, may require us to repurchase Series A preferred stock, which could have the effect of making an acquisition of our company more expensive and potentially deterring proposed transactions that may otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders.\nThe purchaser of our Series A preferred stock may exercise influence over us, including through its ability to designate a director on our board of directors.\nThe investment agreement contains certain negative operating covenants which we have agreed to comply with following closing of the Private Placement and for so long as the purchaser continues to own at least 30% of the shares of Series A preferred stock issued to it in the Private Placement.\nFurther, the terms of the investment agreement will entitle the initial purchaser of our Series A preferred stock to nominate one individual for election to our board of directors so long as the purchaser continues to own at least 30% of the common stock issuable or issued upon conversion of the Series A preferred stock originally issued to it in the Private Placement. In addition, if we fail to maintain certain levels of commissions receivable and liquidity, the purchaser will be entitled to nominate one additional director. The director designated by the purchaser will also be entitled to serve on committees of our board of directors, subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules. Notwithstanding the fact that all directors will be subject to fiduciary duties to us and to applicable law, the interests of the director designated by the purchaser of our Series A preferred stock may differ from the interests of our security holders as a whole or of our other directors.\nOur debt obligations contain restrictions that impact our business and expose us to risks that could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nWe are party to a credit agreement with Royal Bank of Canada and other lenders that enables us to borrow up to $75 million pursuant to a revolving credit facility. This credit agreement imposes certain covenants and restrictions on our business and our ability to obtain additional financing. As of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility.\nThe credit agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, including covenants regarding the payment of taxes and other obligations, maintenance of insurance, reporting requirements and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The credit agreement also contains restrictions that, subject to certain exceptions, limit our ability to merge or consolidate, sell or transfer assets outside the ordinary course of business, make certain types of investments and restricted payments, pay dividends, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, or enter into transactions with affiliates without the lender\u2019s consent. Further, the credit agreement contains a financial covenant requiring the Company to maintain a minimum level of excess availability at any time. The facility contains events of default, including, among others, non-payment defaults, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other indebtedness, judgment defaults, collateral defaults, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults and a change of control default.\nIf we experience a decline in cash flow due to any of the factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section or otherwise, we could have difficulty paying interest and principal amounts due on our indebtedness and meeting the financial covenants set forth in our loan facility. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain the funds necessary to make required payments under the credit facility, or if we fail to comply with the requirements of our indebtedness, we could default under our credit facility. Any default that is not cured or waived could result in the acceleration of the obligations under the credit facility, an increase in the applicable interest rate under the credit facility, and would permit our lender to exercise rights and remedies with respect to all of the collateral that is securing the credit facility, which includes substantially all of our assets. Any such default could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nEven if we comply with all of the applicable covenants, the restrictions on the conduct of our business could materially adversely affect our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financings, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be beneficial to the business. Even if the credit facility were terminated, additional debt we could incur in the future may subject us to similar or additional covenants, which could place restrictions on the operation of our business.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements could be impaired, which could adversely affect our operating results, our ability to operate our business and our stock price.\nWe have a complex business organization. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to help ensure that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently and is complicated by the expansion of our business operations and changing accounting requirements. Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors or all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. Over time, controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may occur. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. We cannot assure that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, cause us to fail to timely meet our periodic reporting obligations, or result in material\nmisstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding disclosure controls and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules promulgated thereunder. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, cause us to fail to timely meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our stock price and potential lawsuits against us.\nChanges in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns or changes in tax legislation could adversely affect our results.\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings differing materially from our projections, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, tax effects of stock-based compensation, outcomes as a result of tax examinations or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, including accounting for uncertain tax positions, or interpretations thereof.\nTo the extent that our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility or adverse outcomes as a result of tax examinations, our operating results could be harmed. Significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, relating to accounting for income taxes. In addition, we are subject to examinations of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, and other tax authorities. We assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There may be exposure that the outcomes from these examinations will have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nWe have net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes to offset future taxable income. Our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin expiring in 2034 and 2021, respectively. A lack of future taxable income would adversely affect our ability to utilize these net operating loss carryforwards. In addition, utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership changes that may have occurred or that could occur in the future, as required by Section 382 of the Code and similar state provisions. These ownership change limitations may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, results from a transaction or series of transactions over a three-year period resulting in an ownership change of more than 50 percentage points (by value) of the outstanding stock of a company by certain stockholders. Our ability to use the remaining net operating loss carryforwards may be further limited if we experience a Section 382 ownership change as a result of future changes in our stock ownership.\nRisks Related to our Technology\nOur ability to sell Medicare-related health insurance plans as a health insurance agent depends upon maintenance of functioning information technology systems.\nThe success of our Medicare plan customer care center operations is dependent upon information technology systems. Many of our Medicare plan members utilize our customer care center in connection with their purchase of a Medicare plan. CMS rules require that our health insurance agent employees utilize CMS-approved scripts in connection with the sale of Medicare plans and that we record and maintain the recording of telephonic interactions relating to the sale of Medicare plans. We rely on telephone, call recording, customer relationship management and other systems and technology in our Medicare customer care center operations, and we are dependent upon third parties for some of them, including our telephone and call recording systems. These systems have failed temporarily in the past and may experience additional disruption due to systems upgrades, power\noutages, an increase in remote work or other impacts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The effectiveness and stability of our Medicare customer care center systems and technology are critical to our ability to sell Medicare plans, particularly during the Medicare enrollment periods, and the failure or interruption of any of these systems and technology or any inability to handle increased volume would harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSystem failures or capacity constraints could harm our business and operating results.\nThe performance, reliability and availability of our ecommerce and telephony platforms and underlying network infrastructures are critical to our financial results, our brand and our relationship with members, marketing partners and health insurance carriers. Although we regularly attempt to enhance our platforms and system infrastructure, system failures and interruptions may occur if we are unable to accurately project the rate or timing of increases in our website or call center traffic or for other reasons, some of which are completely outside our control. We could experience significant failures and interruptions, which would harm our business, operating results and financial condition. If these failures or interruptions occurred during the Medicare annual enrollment period, the Medicare Advantage open enrollment period or during the open enrollment period under health care reform, the negative impact on us would be particularly pronounced.\nWe rely in part upon third-party vendors, including data center, cloud infrastructure, and bandwidth providers, to operate our ecommerce and telephony platforms. We cannot predict whether additional network capacity will be available from these vendors as we need it, and our network or our suppliers\u2019 networks might be unable to achieve or maintain a sufficiently high capacity of data transmission. Any system failure that causes an interruption in or decreases the responsiveness of our services would impair our revenue-generating capabilities and harm our business and operating results and damage our reputation. In addition, any loss of data could result in loss of customers and subject us to potential liability. Our facilities and our database and systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error, fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, acts of terrorism, other attempts to harm our systems and similar events. In addition, our operations are vulnerable to earthquakes, fire, severe weather conditions, including those brought about by climate change, and other natural disasters in the San Francisco Bay Area and elsewhere in Northern California, China, and as well as in other parts of the U.S. where we or our outsourced health insurance agents maintain offices.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm our business and operating results.\nWe believe that our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business and that our technology currently gives us a competitive advantage in the distribution of Medicare-related, individual and family and small business health insurance. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights in the United States. The efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective, and our trademarks may be held invalid or unenforceable. Moreover, the law relating to intellectual property is not as developed in China, and our intellectual property rights may not be as respected in China as they are in the United States. We may not be effective in policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property, trade secrets and other confidential information, and even if we do detect violations, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. Any enforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive, could divert our management\u2019s attention and may result in a court determining that our intellectual property or other rights are unenforceable. If we are not successful in cost-effectively protecting our intellectual property rights, trade secrets and confidential information, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nConsumers depend upon third-party service providers to access our website and services, and our business and operating results could be harmed as a result of technical difficulties experienced by these service providers.\nConsumers using our website and accessing our services depend upon Internet, online and other service providers for access to our website and services. Many of these service providers have experienced significant outages, delays and other difficulties in the past and could experience them in the future. Any significant interruption in access to our call centers or our website or increase in our website\u2019s response time as a result of these difficulties could damage our relationship with insurance carriers, marketing partners and existing and potential members and could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance.\nFrom time to time, we have released, and may continue to release guidance in earnings conference calls, earnings releases, or otherwise, regarding our future performance that represents our management's estimates as of the date of release. This guidance, which includes forward-looking statements, has been and will be based on projections prepared by our management. Guidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions underlying the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Our actual results have, and may in the future, vary from our guidance and the variations may be material. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged not to rely upon our guidance in making an investment decision regarding our common stock.\nProjections are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. Among these factors, the assumptions underlying our estimates of commission revenue as required by ASC 606, may vary significantly over time. We may state possible outcomes as high and low ranges. Any range we provide is not intended to imply that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. Any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section could result in the actual operating results being different from our guidance, and the differences may be adverse and material. The principal reason that we release guidance is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors and we may decide to suspend guidance at any time. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such third parties.\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile, and the value of your investment could decline.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile and is likely to continue to fluctuate substantially. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the closing price of our common stock fluctuated from $61.81 to $146.09 per share. The trading price of our common stock depends on a number of factors, including those described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, many of which are beyond our control and may not be related to our operating performance. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock since you might be unable to sell your shares at or above the price you paid. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock include the following:\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022volatility in the market prices and trading volumes of our competitors' shares, including high technology stocks, which have historically experienced high levels of volatility;\n\u2022new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business, including developments relating to the health care industry and the marketing and sale of Medicare plans;\n\u2022actual or anticipated changes in our operating results or the growth rate of our business;\n\u2022changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, and of our competitors;\n\u2022failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022sales of shares of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services;\n\u2022the public reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\u2022negative publicity about us, including accurate and inaccurate third-party commentary or reports regarding us;\n\u2022actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors' businesses, or the competitive landscape generally;\n\u2022our ability to control costs, including our operating expenses;\n\u2022litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n\u2022developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022announced or completed acquisitions of businesses or technologies by us or our competitors;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\n\u2022any significant change in our management; and\n\u2022general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.\nThe effect of such factors on the trading market for our stock may be enhanced by the lack of a large and established trading market for our stock. In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. Additionally, as a public company, we face the risk of shareholder lawsuits, particularly if we experience declines in the price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market prices of a particular company's securities, securities class action lawsuits have often been instituted against affected companies. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to such legal actions.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur certificate of incorporation, bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions which could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying, or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Our corporate governance documents include provisions:\n\u2022creating a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022authorizing undesignated preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend, and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u2022limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u2022limiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings;\n\u2022requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of board of directors and stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022providing our board of directors with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings and to cancel previously scheduled special meetings.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock.\nAny provision of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 91498, "SIC": 6411, "TIC": "EHTH"}
