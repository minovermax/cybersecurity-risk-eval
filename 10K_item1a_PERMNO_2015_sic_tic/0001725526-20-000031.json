{"cik": "1725526", "company": "HighPoint Resources Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business involves a high degree of risk. If any of the following risks, or any risk described elsewhere in this Form 10-K, actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer. The risks described below are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial also may adversely affect our Company.\nRisks Related to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Our Business\nOil and gas prices are volatile and changes in prices can significantly affect our financial results and estimated proved oil and gas reserves.\nOur revenue, profitability and cash flow depend upon the prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs. The markets for these commodities are very volatile, based on supply and demand, and even relatively modest drops in prices can significantly affect our financial results and impede our growth. Changes in oil, natural gas and NGL prices have a significant impact on the value of our reserves and on our cash flow. Prices for oil, natural gas and NGLs may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022\nthe global demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations;\n\u2022\nvariations between product prices at sales points and applicable index prices;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic conditions in oil producing countries, including the Middle East and South America;\n\u2022\nthe ability and willingness of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\"OPEC\") and other oil-producing countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\nnational and global economic conditions;\n\u2022\nproximity and capacity of oil and gas pipelines, refineries and other transportation and processing facilities;\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels; and\n\u2022\nthe strength of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies.\nLower oil, natural gas and NGL prices may not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis, but also may reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can produce economically and therefore the quantity and the estimated present value of our reserves. If this occurs or if our estimates of development costs increase, production data factors change or our exploration or development results deteriorate, successful efforts accounting rules may require us to write down or impair, as a non-cash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties. We are required to perform impairment tests on our assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or whenever management's plans change with respect to those assets.\nOil prices declined significantly in a number of recent periods, including the fourth quarter of 2018. Natural gas and NGL prices have also fallen significantly in some recent periods. These decreases have increased the volatility and amplitude of the other risks facing us as described in this report and have impacted our business and financial condition. If oil prices decrease from current levels, our planned drilling projects may become uneconomic, which could affect future drilling plans and growth rates. Low commodity prices impact our revenue, which we partially mitigate with our hedging program. Continued low commodity prices make it more challenging to hedge production at higher price levels.\nOur drilling efforts and our well operations may not be profitable or achieve our targeted returns.\nDrilling for oil, natural gas and NGLs may result in unprofitable efforts from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient commercial quantities to cover drilling, operating and other costs. In addition, even a commercial well may have production that is less, or costs that are greater, than we projected. The cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and many factors can adversely affect the economics of a well or property. Drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of unexpected drilling conditions, equipment failures or accidents, shortages of equipment or personnel, environmental issues, midstream constraints and for other reasons. We rely to a significant extent on seismic data and other advanced technologies in identifying unproved property prospects. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively, prior to acquisition of unproved property or drilling a well, whether oil, natural gas or NGLs are present or may be produced economically. The use of seismic data and other technologies also requires greater pre-drilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies. Drilling results in some of our plays may be more uncertain than in other plays that are more mature and have longer established drilling and production histories, and we can provide no assurance that drilling and completion techniques that have proven to be successful in other formations to maximize recoveries will be ultimately successful when used in our prospects. As a result, we may incur future dry hole costs and/or impairment charges due to any of these factors.\nWe have acquired significant amounts of proved and unproved property in order to attempt to further our exploration and development efforts. Drilling and production activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be discovered. We acquire proved and unproved properties and lease undeveloped acreage that we believe will enhance our growth potential and increase our earnings over time. We cannot guarantee that all prospects will be economically viable or that we will not abandon our initial investments. Additionally, there can be no assurance that proved or unproved property acquired by us or undeveloped acreage leased by us will be profitably developed, that new wells drilled by us in prospects that we pursue will be productive, that we will recover all or any portion of our investment in such proved or unproved property or wells, or that we will succeed in bringing on additional partners.\nSubstantially all of our producing properties are located in the DJ Basin, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area.\nOur operations are focused on the DJ Basin, which means our current producing properties and new drilling opportunities are geographically concentrated in that area. Because our operations are not as diversified geographically as many of our competitors, the success of our operations and our profitability may be disproportionately exposed to the effect of any regional events, including fluctuations in prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs produced from the wells in the region, natural disasters, restrictive governmental regulations, transportation capacity constraints, weather, curtailment of production or interruption of transportation and processing, and any resulting delays or interruptions of production from existing or planned new wells.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business and the recording of proved reserves. Changes in the regulatory environment could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur exploration, development, production and marketing operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels including those governing emissions to air, wastewater discharges, hazardous and solid wastes, remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, protection of surface and groundwater, land reclamation and preservation of natural resources. Under these laws and regulations, we could be held liable for personal injuries, property damage (including site clean-up and restoration costs) and other damages. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may also result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, including the assessment of natural resource damages. Environmental and other governmental laws and regulations also increase the costs to plan, permit, design, drill, install, operate and abandon oil and natural gas wells and related facilities. Moreover, public interest in environmental protection has increased in recent years, and environmental organizations have opposed, with some success, certain drilling projects, leading to delays.\nThe regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to frequent changes, often in ways that increase our costs and make it more difficult for us to obtain necessary permits in a timely manner. See \"Business and Properties-Operations-Environmental Matters and Regulation\" for a summary of certain environmental regulations that affect our business and related developments, including potential future regulatory developments.\nOur success depends on key members of our management and our ability to attract and retain experienced technical and other professional personnel.\nOur future success depends to a large extent on the services of our key employees. The loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, competition for experienced technical and other\nprofessional personnel remains strong. If we cannot retain our current personnel or attract additional experienced personnel, our ability to compete could be adversely affected. Also, the loss of experienced personnel could lead to a loss of technical expertise.\nMarket conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production.\nMarket conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production. The availability of a ready market for our oil, natural gas and NGL production depends on a number of factors, including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of our reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities. Our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems, pipelines, processing facilities and refineries owned and operated by third parties. We may be required to shut in wells for a lack of a market or because of inadequacy or unavailability of natural gas pipeline, gathering system capacity or processing facilities. If that were to occur, we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until production arrangements were made to deliver the production to market.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and gas operations. In addition, we may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nWe are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured or under-insured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities, including well stimulation and completion activities such as hydraulic fracturing, are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the possibility of:\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other pollution into the environment, including groundwater contamination;\n\u2022\nabnormally pressured or structured formations;\n\u2022\nmechanical difficulties, such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u2022\nfires, explosions and ruptures of pipelines;\n\u2022\npersonal injuries and death; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of:\n\u2022\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u2022\ndamage to and destruction of property and equipment;\n\u2022\ndamage to natural resources due to underground migration of hydraulic fracturing fluids or other fluids or gases;\n\u2022\npollution and other environmental damage, including spillage or mishandling of recovered hydrocarbons, hydraulic fracturing fluids and produced water;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations and penalties;\n\u2022\nsuspension of our operations; and\n\u2022\nrepair and remediation costs.\nWe have elected, and may in the future elect, not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. For example, we do not carry business interruption insurance for these reasons. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Further, we could be unaware of a pollution event when it occurs and therefore be unable to report the event within the time period required under the relevant policy. The occurrence of an event that is not covered or not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our production, revenues and results of operations and overall financial condition.\nOur operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil, natural gas and NGL reserves.\nThe oil and gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the development, production and acquisition of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. To date, we have financed capital expenditures primarily with cash generated by operations, sales of our equity and debt securities, proceeds from bank borrowings and sales of properties. Our cash flow from operations and access to capital is subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022\nour proved reserves;\n\u2022\nthe level of oil, natural gas and NGLs we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u2022\nthe prices at which oil, natural gas and NGLs are sold;\n\u2022\nthe costs required to operate production;\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;\n\u2022\nglobal credit and securities markets;\n\u2022\nthe ability and willingness of lenders and investors to provide capital and the cost of that capital; and\n\u2022\nthe interest of buyers in our properties and the price they are willing to pay for properties.\nIf our revenues or the borrowing base under our Amended Credit Facility decreases as a result of lower oil, natural gas and NGLs prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current or planned levels. We may, from time to time, need to seek additional financing. Our Amended Credit Facility and senior note indentures place certain restrictions on our ability to obtain new financing. There can be no assurance as to the availability or terms of any additional financing. Recent commodity price decreases have made it substantially more difficult for us and other industry participants to raise capital, and will likely have an adverse effect on our borrowing base.\nIf additional capital is needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. If the cash generated by operations or the amount available under our Amended Credit Facility is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to exploration and development of our prospects, which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves as well as our revenues and results of operations.\nOur identified drilling location inventories are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling.\nOur management has specifically identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These identified drilling locations represent a significant part of our strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including the availability of capital, seasonal conditions, regulatory approvals, oil, natural gas and NGLs prices, costs and drilling results. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil, natural gas and NGLs from these or any other potential drilling locations. As such, our actual drilling activities may differ materially from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business.\nCompetition in the oil and gas industry is intense, which may adversely affect our ability to succeed.\nThe oil and gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies that have greater resources. Many of these companies not only explore for, develop and produce oil, natural gas and NGLs, but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies are able to pay more for producing oil, natural gas and NGLs properties and exploration and development prospects or define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, these companies have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil, natural gas and NGLs market prices. Our larger or integrated competitors are better able than we are to absorb the burden of existing and any changes to federal, state, local and Native American tribal laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, because we have fewer financial resources than many companies in our industry, we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for producing properties and exploration and development prospects.\nThe willingness and ability of our lenders to fund their lending obligations under our revolving Amended Credit Facility may be limited, which would affect our ability to fund our operations.\nOur Amended Credit Facility has commitments from 11 lenders. If credit markets become turbulent as a result of an economic downturn, increased regulatory oversight, lower commodity prices or other factors, our lenders may become more restrictive in their lending practices or may be unwilling or unable to fund their commitments, which would limit our access to capital to fund our capital expenditures, operations or meet other obligations. This would limit our ability to generate revenues as well as limit our projected production and reserves growth, leading to declining production and potentially losses.\nA U.S. and global economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nAny or all of the following may occur if, as a result of a crisis in the global financial and securities markets, a deterioration in national or global growth prospects or other factors, an economic downturn occurs:\n\u2022\nThe economic slowdown could lead to lower demand for oil and natural gas by individuals and industries, which in turn could result in lower prices for the oil and natural gas sold by us, lower revenues and possibly losses. Significant recent commodity price declines have been caused in part by concerns about future global economic growth. This factor has at times been exacerbated by increases in oil and gas supply resulting from increases in U.S. oil and gas production.\n\u2022\nThe lenders under our Amended Credit Facility may become more restrictive in their lending practices or unable or unwilling to fund their commitments, which would limit our access to capital to fund our capital expenditures and operations. This would limit our ability to generate revenues as well as limit our projected production and reserves growth, leading to declining production and possibly losses.\n\u2022\nWe may be unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing, which would require us to limit our capital expenditures and other spending. This would lead to lower production levels and reserves than if we were able to spend more than our cash flow. Financing costs may significantly increase as lenders may be reluctant to lend without receiving higher fees and spreads.\n\u2022\nThe losses incurred by financial institutions and the insolvency of some financial institutions heightens the risk that a counterparty to our hedge arrangements could default on its obligations. These losses and the possibility of a counterparty declaring bankruptcy or being placed in conservatorship or receivership may affect the ability of the counterparties to meet their obligations to us on hedge transactions, which could reduce our revenues from hedges at a time when we are also receiving a lower price for our natural gas and oil sales. As a result, our financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\u2022\nOur credit facility bears floating interest rates based on the London Interbank Offer Rate (\"LIBOR\"). As banks were reluctant to lend to each other to avoid risk, LIBOR increased to unprecedented spread levels in 2008. Such increases caused and may in the future cause higher interest expense for unhedged levels of LIBOR-based borrowings. In addition, LIBOR may be eliminated in the near future as a reference index for determining interest rates under credit arrangements. The elimination of LIBOR may cause us to incur increased interest expense.\n\u2022\nOur credit facility requires the lenders to redetermine our borrowing base semi-annually. The redeterminations are based on our proved reserves and hedge position based on price assumptions that our lenders require us to use to calculate reserves pursuant to the credit facility. The lenders could reduce their price assumptions used to determine reserves for calculating our borrowing base due to lower commodities and futures prices and our borrowing base could be reduced. This would reduce our funds available to borrow. In addition, the lenders can request an interim redetermination during each six month period which could reduce the funds available to borrow under our credit facility.\n\u2022\nBankruptcies of financial institutions or illiquidity of money market funds may limit or delay our access to our cash and cash equivalent deposits, causing us to lose some or all of those funds or to incur additional costs to borrow funds needed on a short-term basis that were previously funded from our money market deposits.\n\u2022\nBankruptcies of purchasers of our oil and natural gas could lead to the delay or failure of us to receive the revenues from those sales.\nOur estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these assumptions will materially affect the quantities of our reserves.\nUnderground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGLs cannot be measured in an exact way. Oil, natural gas and NGLs reserve engineering requires estimates of underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGLs and assumptions concerning future oil, natural gas and NGLs prices, production levels and operating and development costs. As a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be inaccurate.\nOur estimates of proved reserves are based on prices and costs determined at the date of the estimate. Any significant variance from these prices and costs could greatly affect our estimates of reserves. We prepare our own estimates of proved\nreserves, which are audited by independent third party petroleum engineers. Over time, our internal engineers may make material changes to reserves estimates taking into account the results of actual drilling, testing and production. For additional information about these risks and their impact on our reserves, see \"Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties-Oil and Gas Data-Proved Reserves\" and \"Supplementary Information to Consolidated Financial Statements-Supplementary Oil and Gas Information (unaudited)-Analysis of Changes in Proved Reserves\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAt December 31, 2019, approximately 59% of our estimated proved reserves (by volume) were undeveloped. These reserve estimates reflect our plans to make significant capital expenditures to convert our PUDs into proved developed reserves, including approximately $1.2 billion during the five years ending December 31, 2024. The estimated development costs may not be accurate, development may not occur as scheduled and results may not be as estimated. If we choose not to develop PUDs, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop them, we will be required to remove the associated volumes from our reported proved reserves. In addition, under the SEC's reserve reporting rules, PUDs generally may be booked only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking, and we may therefore be required to downgrade to probable or possible any PUDs that are not developed within this five-year time frame.\nUnless we replace our oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nProducing oil, natural gas and NGL reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. The rate of decline may be different than we have estimated and may change over time. Our future oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and production, and therefore our cash flow and income, are highly dependent upon our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs.\nProperties that we buy may not produce as projected and we may be unable to determine reserve potential, identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain protection from sellers.\nOne of our strategies is to capitalize on opportunistic acquisitions of oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves. Our reviews of acquired properties are inherently incomplete, because it generally is not feasible to review in depth every individual property involved in each acquisition. Ordinarily, we will focus our review efforts on the higher value properties and will sample the remaining properties for reserve potential. However, even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems, nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential. Inspections may not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems, such as ground water contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, we often assume certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties.\nOur hedging activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our income.\nTo achieve a more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of commodities, we currently, and will likely in the future, enter into hedging arrangements for a portion of our production revenues. Hedging arrangements for a portion of our production revenues expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when:\n\u2022\nthere is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received;\n\u2022\nour production is less than we expect;\n\u2022\nthere is a change in the mark to market value of our derivatives; or\n\u2022\nthe counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contractual obligations.\nIn addition, these types of hedging arrangements limit the benefit we would receive from increases in commodities prices and may expose us to cash margin requirements if we hedge with counterparties who are not parties to our credit facility.\nOur counterparties are financial institutions that are lenders under our Amended Credit Facility or affiliates of such lenders. The risk that a counterparty may default on its obligations increases when overall economic conditions deteriorate. Losses resulting from adverse economic conditions or other factors may affect the ability of the counterparties to meet their obligations to us on hedge transactions, which could reduce our revenues from hedges at a time when we are also receiving lower prices for our production. As a result, our financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nFederal legislation may decrease our ability, and increase the cost, to enter into hedge transactions.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\"Dodd-Frank\") was signed into law in July 2010. Dodd-Frank regulates derivative transactions, including our commodity derivative swaps. We expect that Dodd-Frank and its implementing regulations will increase the cost to hedge as a result of fewer counterparties being in the market and the pass-through of increased capital costs of bank subsidiaries. The imposition of margin requirements or other restrictions on our hedging activities could make hedging more expensive or impracticable. A reduction in our ability to enter into hedging transactions would expose us to additional risks related to commodity price volatility and impair our ability to have certainty with respect to a portion of our cash flow, which could lead to decreases in capital spending and, therefore, decreases in future production and reserves.\nThe inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results.\nSubstantially all of our accounts receivable result from oil, natural gas and NGLs sales or joint interest billings to third parties in the energy industry. This concentration of customers and joint interest owners may impact our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions. In addition, our oil, natural gas and NGLs hedging arrangements expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. An economic downturn and/or an extended period of low commodity prices would increase these risks.\nWe face risks related to rating agency downgrades.\nIf one or more rating agencies downgrades our outstanding debt, future debt issuance could become more difficult and costly. Also, we may be required to provide collateral or other credit support to certain counterparties, which would increase our costs and limit our liquidity.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cyber-security threats, and other disruptions.\nAs an oil and natural gas producer, we face various security threats, including cyber-security threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, acquire cash or other assets through theft or fraud or render data or systems unusable, threats to the safety of our employees, threats to the security of our facilities and infrastructure or third party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines, and threats from terrorist acts. Cyber-security attacks in particular are evolving and include but are not limited to, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data or misappropriation of assets. There can be no assurance that the procedures and controls we use to monitor and mitigate these risks will be sufficient in preventing security threats from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, assets, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nLand owner demands associated with previously divested wells in Wyoming could have adverse effects on our business.\nIn December 2015, the Wyoming Supreme Court issued its \"Pennaco\" decision, the essence of which is that parties to a contract, such as a surface use agreement, remain liable for the obligations under that agreement - even when the agreement and the underlying assets have been sold and assigned to a third party - unless the agreement contains express language releasing and discharging the original party upon such subsequent assignment.\nLandowners across Wyoming are making Pennaco claims against companies that sold assets to other oil and gas companies that are now in default. To date, our exposure relates to coalbed methane (\"CBM\") leases and wells that we sold to entities which are now essentially defunct, if not in actual bankruptcy proceedings. These operators have defaulted on several annual surface use payments, as well as leaving more than 150 CBM wells acquired from us in non-producing (shut-in) status. We have been contacted by several large ranches or their attorneys demanding payment of amounts in arrears, and that we conduct the plugging of the wells and land reclamation. Each case entails determining what contractual obligations are imposed by the applicable surface use agreement, taking into account state and federal plugging and reclamation requirements.\nWe obtained orders from the Wyoming Oil & Gas Conservation Commission (\"WOGCC\") requiring two of the defaulting operators to \"show cause\" as to why the WOGCC should not authorize us to take over the wells in order to conduct plugging and reclamation operations. In response to these orders, we reached contractual agreements that provide us with the authority to plug and abandon any or all of the wells sold to those operators. We have negotiated settlement and release agreements with several ranches that require payments and scheduled plugging and reclamation activities. In certain cases, ranch owners have\nexpressed interest in conversion of CBM wells to water wells. We are under no current WOGCC compulsion to plug wells. A substantial number of wells are federally-permitted, and the Company and the BLM have recently negotiated a plugging and reclamation schedule for these wells. During 2019, the Company plugged 53 wells and 3 wells were converted to water wells by the landowner. In 2020, the Company plans to plug and abandon an additional 65 wells.\nWe do not believe that resolving this matter will have a material financial impact. We believe that, if necessary, the currently identified roster of shut-in wells can be plugged and reclaimed at cost of approximately $15,000 per well. There is no assurance, however, that this issue will not expand to wells sold to other purchasers of Wyoming assets previously owned by us.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nIf we cannot meet the \"price criteria\" for continued listing on the NYSE, the NYSE may delist our common stock, which could have an adverse impact on the trading volume, liquidity and market price of our common stock.\nIf we do not maintain an average closing price of $1.00 or more for our common stock over any consecutive 30 trading-day period, the NYSE may delist our common stock for failure to maintain compliance with the NYSE price criteria listing standards. As of February 4, 2020, the average closing price of our common stock over the immediately preceding 30 consecutive trading-day period was $1.45. The NYSE Listed Company Manual sets out rules and processes to cure non-compliance with this standard. For instance, an issuer generally has six months to cure the listing standard related to stock price (including through a reverse-stock split), during which time the issuer's common stock would continue to be traded on the NYSE, subject to compliance with the other continued listing standards. A delisting of our common stock from the NYSE could negatively impact us because it could reduce the liquidity and market price of our common stock and reduce the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing, and/or diminish the value of equity incentives available to provide to our employees.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of us, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nDelaware corporate law and our current certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay, defer or prevent a change in control of us or our management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\ngiving the board the exclusive right to fill all board vacancies;\n\u2022\nrequiring special meetings of stockholders to be called only by the board;\n\u2022\nrequiring advance notice for stockholder proposals and director nominations;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors; and\n\u2022\nallowing for authorized but unissued common and preferred shares.\nThese provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions that are opposed by our board. As a result, these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, and this may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.\nRisks Related to our Senior Notes and Amended Credit Facility\nWe may not be able to generate enough cash flow to meet our debt obligations, including our obligations and commitments under our senior notes and our Amended Credit Facility.\nWe expect that our earnings and cash flow could vary significantly from year to year due to the cyclical nature of our industry. As a result, the amount of debt that we can manage in some periods may not be appropriate for us in other periods. In addition, our future cash flow may be insufficient to meet our debt obligations and commitments, including our 7.0% Senior Notes due 2022 (\"7.0% Senior Notes\"), 8.75% Senior Notes due 2025 (\"8.75% Senior Notes\") and our Amended Credit Facility. Any insufficiency could negatively impact our business. A range of economic, competitive, business, and industry factors will affect our future financial performance, and, as a result, our ability to generate cash flow from operations and to repay our debt. Many of these factors, such as oil and gas prices, economic and financial conditions in our industry and the global economy or competitive initiatives of our competitors, are beyond our control. In particular, these risks have been significantly exacerbated by the sustained decline in commodity prices.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the total outstanding principal amount of our indebtedness was $765.0 million, and we had $334.0 million in additional borrowing capacity under our Amended Credit Facility, which, if borrowed, would be secured debt effectively senior to the Senior Notes to the extent of the value of the collateral securing that indebtedness. The borrowing base is dependent on our proved reserves and was, as of December 31, 2019, $500.0 million based on our proved reserves and hedge position. Our borrowing capacity is reduced by a $26.0 million letter of credit. As of December 31, 2019, we had $140.0 million outstanding under our Amended Credit Facility.\nThe borrowing base is set at the sole discretion of the lenders. Our next scheduled borrowing base redetermination is scheduled on or about April 1, 2020 based on proved reserves as of December 31, 2019 at updated bank price decks and hedge position. However, in the event of lower capital investment in our properties due to a sustained cycle of low commodity prices, we could see lower quantities of proved developed reserves which would, in combination with lower oil and gas commodity pricing, lead to lower borrowing bases.\nIf we do not generate enough cash flow from operations to satisfy our debt obligations, we may have to undertake one or more alternative financing plans, such as:\n\u2022\nrefinancing or restructuring our debt;\n\u2022\nselling assets;\n\u2022\nreducing or delaying capital investments; or\n\u2022\nseeking to raise additional capital.\nHowever, any alternative financing plans that we undertake may not be completed in a timely manner or at all, and even if completed may not allow us to meet our debt obligations. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations, including our obligations under the senior notes, or to obtain alternative financing, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur debt could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our costs of doing business;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to fund future capital expenditures and working capital, to engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or to otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments of interest and principal on our debt or to comply with any restrictive terms of our debt;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nimpair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt.\nWe may be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations that the restrictive covenants under the indentures governing the senior notes and our Amended Credit Facility impose on us.\nThe Amended Credit Facility also contains certain financial covenants. We are currently in compliance with all financial covenants and have complied with all financial covenants since issuance. We expect to be in compliance with all financial covenants based on our 2020 budget at current commodity prices. However, if commodity prices significantly decline, EBITDAX will be significantly reduced, which is a critical underpinning of our required financial covenants. If this were to occur, it will make it necessary for us to negotiate an amendment to one or more of these financial covenants.\nIf we fail to comply with the covenants or other terms of any agreements governing our debt, our lenders and holders of our notes may have the right to accelerate the maturity of that debt and foreclose upon the collateral, if any, securing that debt. If that occurs, we may not be able to make all of the required payments or borrow sufficient funds to refinance such debt or take other actions to pay the accelerated debt. Even if new financing were available at that time, it may not be on terms that are acceptable to us. A breach of any covenant would also limit the funds available under our Amended Credit Facility. In September 2015, we obtained an amendment to the Amended Credit Facility that replaced our debt-to-EBITDAX covenant in the facility for a limited period of time. Through March 31, 2018, the covenants are secured debt-to-EBITDAX and EBITDAX-to-interest. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain similar amendments, or waivers of covenant breaches, in the future if needed.\nRisks Related to Tax\nWe may incur more taxes as a result of new tax legislation.\nThe Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the \"TCJA\") was passed in December 2017 and included provisions that could limit certain tax deductions:\n\u2022\ninterest expense is limited to 30% of our taxable income (with certain adjustments);\n\u2022\nexpanded Section 162(m) limitations on the deductibility of officers' compensation; and\n\u2022\nnet operating losses (\"NOL\") incurred after 2017 are limited to 80% of taxable income but can be carried forward indefinitely.\nThese changes may increase our future tax liability in some circumstances. In addition, proposals are made from time to time to amend U.S. federal and state income tax laws in ways that would be adverse to us, including by eliminating certain key U.S. federal income tax preferences currently available with respect to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production. The changes could include (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion deduction for crude oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs and (iii) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. Also, state severance taxes may increase in the states in which we operate. This could adversely affect our existing operations in the relevant state and the economic viability of future drilling.\nOur future utilization of NOLs and tax credit carryforwards have been limited by the Merger and may be further limited based on current Internal Revenue Code restrictions.\nWe have significant deferred tax assets for Federal and state NOL carryforwards. Subject to certain limitations and applicable expiration dates, these tax attributes can be carried forward to reduce our federal income tax liability for future periods. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), the ability to utilize NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income is subject to limitation if a greater than 50% ownership change occurs (\"Section 382 change of ownership\"). A Section 382 change of ownership refers to an increase in ownership of more than 50% of our shares by certain groups of shareholders during any three-year period, as determined under certain conventions.\nThe Merger resulted in a Section 382 change of ownership, limiting our ability to use pre-change NOLs and credits against post-change taxable income to an annual limitation amount plus certain built-in gains recognized within five years of the ownership change (\"RBIG\"). The annual limitation amount of $11.7 million was computed by multiplying our fair market value on the date of the ownership change by a published long-term tax-exempt bond rate. Our RBIG is projected to be $176.9 million. We have reduced our federal and state NOLs by $276.1 million and $14.0 million, respectively, and eliminated our state tax credits by $8.2 million to reflect the expected impact of the Section 382 change of ownership. Deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowance have been reduced by $65.0 million for the expected tax-effected impact of the Section 382 change of ownership.", "PERMNO": 90494, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "HPR"}
