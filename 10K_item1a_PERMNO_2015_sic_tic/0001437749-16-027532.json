{"cik": "1071255", "company": "GOLDEN ENTERTAINMENT, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-14", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects could be materially harmed and the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes.\nAny failure to successfully integrate our businesses and businesses we acquire, including Sartini Gaming\u2019s legacy business and the Montana distributed gaming business, could materially adversely affect our business, and we may not realize the full benefits of the Merger or our other strategic acquisitions.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger or our other strategic acquisitions will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to successfully integrate our businesses and businesses we acquire, including Sartini Gaming\u2019s legacy business and the Montana distributed gaming business. Integrating and coordinating certain aspects of the operations and personnel of multiple businesses and managing the expansion in the scope of our operations and financial systems involves complex operational, technological and personnel-related challenges. In particular, our management will be required to devote a significant amount of time and attention to the process of integrating our legacy operations with those of Sartini Gaming. The potential difficulties, and resulting costs and delays, relating to the integration of our business and Sartini Gaming\u2019s legacy businesses, the Montana distributed gaming business or other strategic acquisitions include:\n\u25cf\nthe difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner;\n\u25cf\nthe challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other benefits expected from acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operations;\n\u25cf\nadditional demands on management related to the increased size and scope of our company following the Merger or other acquisitions;\n\u25cf\nthe assimilation of employees and the integration of different business cultures;\n\u25cf\nchallenges in attracting and retaining key personnel;\n\u25cf\nthe need to integrate information, accounting, finance, sales, billing, payroll and regulatory compliance systems;\n\u25cf\nchallenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers; and\n\u25cf\nchallenges in combining product offerings and sales and marketing activities.\nThere is no assurance that we will successfully or cost-effectively integrate our businesses and businesses we acquire, including Sartini Gaming\u2019s legacy business and the Montana distributed gaming business. The costs of achieving systems integration may substantially exceed our current estimates. As non-public companies, neither Sartini Gaming nor the Montana distributed gaming business had to comply with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for internal control over financial reporting and other procedures. Bringing the legacy systems for these businesses into compliance with those requirements may cause us to incur substantial additional expense. Even though management did not perform the evaluation of Sartini Gaming\u2019s internal control over financial reporting in connection with our evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, we became aware of certain material weaknesses in Sartini Gaming\u2019s internal control over financial reporting with respect to preparation and review of account reconciliations and related journal entries and Sartini Gaming\u2019s general information technology controls. For a description of these material weaknesses, see \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\u201d contained in Part II of this report. The existence of one or more internal control deficiencies could result in errors in our financial statements, and substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify internal control deficiencies. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, the market price of our stock could decline significantly, we may be unable to obtain additional financing to operate and expand our business, and our business and financial condition could be harmed.\nIn addition, the integration process may cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our combined business. If management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer and our results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.\nEven if our businesses are successfully integrated, we may not realize the full benefits of the Merger or our other strategic acquisitions, including anticipated synergies, cost savings or growth opportunities, within the expected timeframes or at all. In addition, we have incurred, and may incur additional, significant integration and restructuring expenses to realize synergies. However, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings. Although we expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may offset incremental transaction, Merger-related and restructuring costs over time, we cannot give any assurance that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term, or at all. Any of these matters could materially adversely affect our businesses or harm our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur business may be adversely affected by economic conditions, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, severe weather, contagious diseases and other factors affecting discretionary consumer spending, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe demand for gaming, entertainment and leisure activities is highly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the corresponding impact on discretionary consumer spending. Any actual or perceived deterioration or weakness in general, regional or local economic conditions, unemployment levels, the job or housing markets, consumer debt levels or consumer confidence, as well as any increase in gasoline prices, tax rates, interest rates, inflation rates or other adverse economic or market conditions, may lead to our customers having less discretionary income to spend on gaming, entertainment and discretionary travel, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nActs of terrorism, natural disasters, severe weather conditions and actual or perceived outbreaks of public health threats and pandemics could also significantly affect demand for gaming, entertainment and leisure activities and discretionary travel, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Furthermore, our properties are subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time, as a result of casualty, flooding, forces of nature, adverse weather conditions, mechanical failure, or extended or extraordinary maintenance, among other causes. If there is a prolonged disruption at any of our casino properties due to natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected. Additionally, if extreme weather adversely impacts general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which we draw our patrons or prevents patrons from easily coming to our properties, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\nWe face substantial competition in both of our business segments, and may lose market share.\nThe distributed gaming and casino resort industries are highly competitive. We face direct competition for our space lease, revenue share and participation locations from others involved in the distributed gaming business, as well as substantial competition for customers from other operators of casinos, hotels, taverns and other entertainment venues. With respect to our casinos, we compete for local gaming customers with other locals-oriented casino-hotels, as well as with other casinos and restricted gaming locations in the vicinity of our properties. We compete for customers primarily on the basis of location, customer service, range and pricing of amenities (including food and entertainment), gaming device payout rates, convenience and overall atmosphere. Many of our regional and national competitors have greater brand recognition and significantly greater resources than we have. Their greater resources may also provide them with the ability to expand operations in the future.\nIn addition, we also face ever-increasing competition from online gaming, including mobile gaming applications for smart phones and tablet computers, state-sponsored lotteries, card clubs, and other forms of legalized gaming. In addition, various forms of internet gaming have been approved in Nevada, and legislation permitting internet gaming has been proposed by the federal government and other states. The expansion of internet gaming in Nevada and other jurisdictions could result in significant additional competition. Furthermore, several states are currently considering legalizing casino gaming in designated areas, and Native American tribes may develop or expand gaming properties in markets located more closely to our customer base. Legalized casino gaming in neighboring states and on Native American land could result in strong competition that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, particularly to the extent that such gaming is conducted in areas close to our gaming operations.\nWe are subject to extensive state and local regulation and licensing from gaming and other government authorities, and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations.\nAs the owner and operator of gaming facilities, we are subject to extensive federal, state, and local regulation. State and local government authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate require us to obtain gaming licenses and require our officers, key employees and business entity affiliates to demonstrate suitability to be involved in gaming operations. These are privileged licenses or approvals that are not guaranteed by statute or regulation. State and local government authorities may limit, condition, suspend or revoke a license, impose substantial fines, and take other actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain and maintain the gaming licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct our gaming operations. Any failure to maintain or renew our existing licenses, registrations, permits or approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Furthermore, if additional gaming laws or regulations are adopted, these regulations could impose additional restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us and our business.\nGaming authorities may, in their sole and absolute discretion, require the holder of any securities issued by us to file applications, be investigated, and be found suitable to own our securities if they have reason to believe that the security ownership would be inconsistent with the declared policies of their respective states. Further, the costs of any investigation conducted by any gaming authority under these circumstances is typically required to be paid by the applicant, and refusal or failure to pay these charges may constitute grounds for a finding that the applicant is unsuitable to own the securities. If any gaming authority determines that a person is unsuitable to own our securities, then, under the applicable gaming laws and regulations, we can be sanctioned, including the loss of our privileged licenses or approvals, if, without the prior approval of the applicable gaming authority, we conduct certain business with the unsuitable person.\nOur officers, directors, and key employees are also subject to a variety of regulatory requirements and various privileged licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities. If any gaming authority with jurisdiction over our business were to find an officer, director or key employee of ours unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would have to sever all relationships with that person. Furthermore, such gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Either result could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and prospects.\nApplicable gaming laws and regulations also restrict our ability to issue securities, incur debt, and undertake other financing activities. Such transactions would generally require approval of gaming authorities, and our financing counterparties, including lenders, might be subject to various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities. If state regulatory authorities were to find any person unsuitable with regard to his, her or its relationship to us or any of our subsidiaries, we would be required to sever our relationship with that person, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time, local and state lawmakers, as well as special interest groups, have proposed legislation that would expand, restrict or prevent gaming operations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Any such change to the regulatory environment or the adoption of new federal, state or local government legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFederal, state and local beer, liquor and food service regulations may have a significant adverse impact on our operations.\nOur brewery operations at PT\u2019s Brewing Company in Las Vegas, Nevada require federal, state, and local licenses, permits and approvals. Our restaurant and on-site brewery at PT\u2019s Brewing Company operate pursuant to exceptions to the \u201ctied house\u201d laws, which in Nevada generally prohibit a manufacturer or supplier of brewery products from engaging in the business of wholesaling and prevent a wholesaler from engaging, directly or indirectly, in retail sales.\nThe manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages is a highly regulated and taxed business. Our brewery operations are subject to more restrictive regulations and increased taxation by federal, state and local governmental entities than are those of non-alcohol related beverage businesses. Federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the production and distribution of beer, including permitting, licensing, trade practices, labeling, advertising, marketing, distributor relationships and related matters. Federal, state and local governmental entities also levy various taxes, license fees, and other similar charges and may require bonds to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable federal, state or local laws and regulations could result in higher taxes, penalties, fees, and suspension or revocation of permits, licenses or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nFrom time to time, local and state lawmakers, as well as special interest groups have proposed legislation that would increase the federal and/or state excise tax on alcoholic beverages or certain types of alcoholic beverages. If adopted, such measures could affect some or all of our proprietary craft beer production. If federal or state excise taxes are increased, we may have to raise prices to maintain our current profit margins. Higher taxes may reduce overall demand for beer, thus negatively impacting sales of our beer. Further federal or state regulation may be forthcoming that could further restrict the distribution and sale of alcohol products. Any material increase in taxes or fees, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees or regulations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, each restaurant we operate must obtain a food service license from local authorities. Failure to comply with such regulations could cause our licenses to be revoked or our related restaurant business or businesses to be forced to cease operations. Moreover, state liquor laws may prevent the expansion of restaurant operations into certain markets.\nChanges to state and federal minimum wage laws or other laws could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nOur business segments operate in the larger hospitality and service industry. Many of our employees, especially those that interact with our customers, receive a base salary or wage that is established by applicable state and federal laws that establish a minimum hourly wage that is, in turn, supplemented through tips and gratuities from customers. From time to time, state and federal lawmakers have increased the minimum wage. It is difficult to predict when such increases may take place and whether they will result an adverse operational and financial condition to our business segments. Any such change to the minimum wage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are subject to a variety of other rules and regulations, including zoning, environmental, construction and land-use laws, regulations and permits. Any changes to these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nChanges to applicable tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nGaming companies are generally subject to significant revenue-based taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state, and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. From time to time, federal, state and local legislators and other government officials have proposed and adopted changes in tax laws, or in the administration or interpretation of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. In addition, any worsening of economic conditions and the large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected budget deficits could intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes and/or property taxes. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration or interpretation of such laws. Any material increase, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur business is geographically concentrated, which subjects us to greater risks from changes in local or regional conditions.\nWe currently conduct our distributed gaming (including tavern gaming) business solely in Nevada and Montana and operate casinos solely in Pahrump, Nevada and Flintstone, Maryland. Due to this geographic concentration, our results of operations and financial condition are subject to greater risks from changes in local and regional conditions, such as:\n\u25cf\nchanges in local or regional economic conditions and unemployment rates;\n\u25cf\nadverse weather conditions and natural disasters (including weather or road conditions that limit access to our properties);\n\u25cf\nchanges in local and state laws and regulations, including gaming laws and regulations;\n\u25cf\na decline in the number of residents in or near, or visitors to, our properties; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in the local or regional competitive environment.\nAs a result of the geographic concentration of our businesses, we face a greater risk of a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects in the event that any of the geographic areas in which we operate is more severely impacted by any such adverse condition, as compared to other areas in the United States.\nThe success of our distributed gaming business is dependent on our ability to renew our contracts.\nWe conduct the majority of our distributed gaming business under space lease, revenue share and participation contracts with third parties. Contracts with chain store and street customers are renewable at the option of the owner of the applicable chain store or street account. As our distributed gaming contracts expire, we are required to compete for renewals. If we are unable to renew a material portion of our space lease, revenue share and participation contracts, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. We cannot assure you that our existing space lease, revenue share and participation contracts will be renewed on reasonable or comparable terms, or at all.\nThe casino, hotel and hospitality industry is capital intensive and we may not be able to finance expansion and renovation projects, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur casino and tavern properties have an ongoing need for renovations and other capital improvements to remain competitive, including replacement, from time to time, of furniture, fixtures and equipment. We may also need to make capital expenditures to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Renovations and other capital improvements of casino properties in particular require significant capital expenditures. In addition, any such renovations and capital improvements usually generate little or no cash flow until the projects are completed. We may not be able to fund such projects solely from cash provided from operating activities. Consequently, we may have to rely upon the availability of debt or equity capital to fund renovations and capital improvements, and our ability to carry them out will be limited if we cannot obtain satisfactory debt or equity financing, which will depend on, among other things, market conditions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to renovate and maintain our casino and tavern properties from time to time may put us at a competitive disadvantage to casinos or taverns offering more modern and better maintained facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe incurred significant indebtedness in connection with the Merger and our significant indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\nWe incurred significant indebtedness in connection with the Merger and the associated refinancing of both Sartini Gaming\u2019s senior secured indebtedness and our former financing facility for Rocky Gap. As of December 31, 2015, our total indebtedness was $148.6 million, as compared to $11.7 million as of December 28, 2014. In connection with the closing of our acquisition of Montana distributed gaming assets, we borrowed an additional $15.0 million under our senior secured revolving credit facility (the \u201cRevolving Credit Facility\u201d) in January 2016. As of December 31, 2015, our debt service obligations, comprised of scheduled principal repayments and interest (excluding capital leases and equipment notes), during the next 12 months were approximately $11.0 million. As a result of the increases in our outstanding debt, demands on our cash resources have increased. The increased level of debt could, among other things:\n\u25cf\nrequire us to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to the servicing and repayment of our debt, thereby reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures and acquisitions, and other general corporate requirements;\n\u25cf\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements;\n\u25cf\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;\n\u25cf\nrestrict our ability to make strategic acquisitions or dispositions or to exploit business opportunities;\n\u25cf\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions and increases in interest rates;\n\u25cf\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u25cf\nadversely affect our credit rating or the market price of our common stock.\nAny of these risks could impact our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness, which could further increase the risks associated with our leverage.\nWe may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, which may include financing relating to capital expenditures, potential acquisitions or business expansion, working capital or general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2015, we had undrawn availability of $15.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility in our Credit Agreement with Capital One, National Association (as administrative agent) and the lenders named therein (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), which amount was subsequently drawn in January 2016 in connection with our acquisition of approximately 1,000 gaming devices, as well as certain non-gaming assets and the right to operate within certain locations, from a distributed gaming operator in the state of Montana. In addition, the Credit Agreement permits us, subject to specified limitations, to incur additional indebtedness. In particular, under the Credit Agreement we may elect to increase the size of the Revolving Credit Facility or amount of the term loan or enter into one or more new tranches of term loans in an aggregate amount not to exceed $50.0 million (provided that the Revolving Credit Facility may not be increased by more than $12.5 million), and we may pursue such additional debt financing in the near future. If new indebtedness is added to our current level of indebtedness, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and fund our working capital and capital expenditures, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our indebtedness will depend upon our future operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow in the future, which are subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings, including borrowings under the Credit Agreement, will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or fund our other liquidity needs. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investment and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, such alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The Credit Agreement restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from the disposition, and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to repay or service our indebtedness. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result, our lenders could declare all outstanding amounts to be due and payable, terminate or suspend their commitments to loan money and foreclose against the assets securing such debt, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and could result in you losing your investment in our company.\nCovenants in our debt instruments restrict our business and could limit our ability to implement our business plan.\nThe Credit Agreement contains, and any future debt instruments likely will contain, covenants that may restrict our ability to implement our business plan, finance future operations, respond to changing business and economic conditions, secure additional financing, and engage in opportunistic transactions, such as strategic acquisitions. The Credit Agreement includes covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to do the following:\n\u25cf\nincur, assume or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u25cf\nissue redeemable stock and preferred stock;\n\u25cf\ngrant or incur liens;\n\u25cf\nsell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;\n\u25cf\nmake loans and investments;\n\u25cf\npay dividends, make distributions, or redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u25cf\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u25cf\nconsolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to, another person.\nIn addition, the Credit Agreement requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, including a maximum total leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio. The Credit Agreement is secured by first-priority liens on substantially all of our and the subsidiary guarantors\u2019 present and future personal and real property (subject to receipt of certain approvals).\nIf we default under the Credit Agreement because of a covenant breach or otherwise, all outstanding amounts thereunder could become immediately due and payable. We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with our financial or other covenants under the Credit Agreement or that any covenant violations will be waived. Any violation that is not waived could result in an event of default and, as a result, our lenders could declare all outstanding amounts to be due and payable, terminate or suspend their commitments to loan money and foreclose against the assets securing such debt, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects and could result in you losing your investment in our company.\nOur ability to utilize our NOLs would be negatively impacted if an ownership change (as defined in Section 382 of the Code) occurs.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $74.8 million of NOLs, which begin to expire in 2032. While these NOLs have a potential to be used to offset future ordinary taxable income and reduce future cash tax liabilities, our ability to utilize these NOLs would be negatively impacted if we were to experience an \u201cownership change,\u201d as defined in Section 382 of the Code. In general terms, an \u201cownership change\u201d can occur whenever one or more \u201c5% stockholders\u201d collectively change the ownership of a company by more than 50 percentage points within a three-year period. The occurrence of such a change generally limits the amount of NOLs a company could utilize in a given year to the aggregate fair market value of the company\u2019s common stock immediately prior to the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt interest rate in effect for the month of the ownership change. The issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with the Merger significantly increased the risk of such an ownership change occurring. To help preserve our ability to utilize our NOLs to offset future taxable income following the Merger, we have amended our Rights Agreement to deter acquisitions of shares of our common stock that would result in a shareholder owing 4.99% or more of our common stock. In addition, we have entered into a NOL Preservation Agreement with the former shareholder of Sartini Gaming, Lyle A. Berman (a director and shareholder of the Company) and certain shareholders affiliated with Mr. Berman or another director of Golden which restrict the ability of such shareholders to take specified actions which could cause such an ownership change to occur. Although our Rights Agreement and the NOL Preservation Agreement are intended to reduce the likelihood of an adverse ownership change under Section 382, they may not prevent such an ownership change from occurring. The determination of whether an ownership change has occurred for purposes of Section 382 of the Code is complex and requires significant judgment. Moreover, the number of shares of our common stock outstanding at any particular time for purposes of Section 382 of the Code (and our Rights Agreement) may differ from the number of shares that we report as outstanding in our filings with the SEC. In the event that the measures we have taken to help preserve our NOLs prove ineffective and an ownership change occurs, our ability to utilize our NOLs would be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may be unable to obtain gaming devices or related technology from our third party suppliers on a timely, cost-effective basis.\nWe currently primarily rely on a limited number of suppliers for our gaming devices and related technology. We cannot assure you that we can obtain gaming devices or related technology on a cost-effective basis. As a result, we may be forced to incur significant unanticipated costs to secure alternative third party suppliers or adjust our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may experience seasonal fluctuations that could significantly impact our quarterly operating results.\nWe may experience seasonal fluctuations that could significantly impact our quarterly operating results. Rocky Gap typically experiences higher revenues during summer months and may be significantly adversely impacted by inclement weather during winter months. Our Nevada casinos and distributed gaming businesses have historically experienced lower revenues during the summer as a result of fewer tourists due to higher temperatures, as well as increased vacation activity by local residents. Our distributed gaming operations typically experience higher revenues during the fall which corresponds with several professional sports seasons. While other factors like unemployment levels, market competition and the diversification of our business may either offset or magnify seasonal effects, some seasonality is likely to continue, which could result in significant fluctuation in our quarterly operating results.\nOur reputation and business could be materially harmed as a result of data breaches, data theft, unauthorized access or hacking.\nOur success depends, in part, on the secure and uninterrupted performance of our information technology and other systems and infrastructure. An increasing number of companies have disclosed breaches of their security, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on their computer networks. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If unauthorized parties gain access to our information technology and other systems, they may be able to misappropriate assets or sensitive information (such as personally identifiable information of our customers, business partners and employees), cause interruption in our operations, corruption of data or computers, or otherwise damage our reputation and business. In such circumstances, we could be held liable to our customers or other parties, or be subject to regulatory or other actions for breaching privacy rules. Any compromise of our security could result in a loss of confidence in our security measures, and subject us to litigation, civil or criminal penalties, and negative publicity, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Further, if we are unable to comply with the security standards established by banks and the payment card industry, we may be subject to fines, restrictions, and expulsion from card acceptance programs, which could materially adversely affect our operations.\nOur insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer. In addition, our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain the same insurance coverage in the future.\nWe have comprehensive property and liability insurance policies for our properties in operation, with coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary in their breadth and scope. Market forces beyond our control may nonetheless limit the scope of the insurance coverage we can obtain or our ability to obtain coverage at reasonable rates. Certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods or terrorist acts, or certain liabilities may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify obtaining insurance. As a result, we may not be successful in obtaining insurance without increases in cost or decreases in coverage levels. In addition, in the event of a substantial loss, the insurance coverage we carry may not be sufficient to pay the full market value or replacement cost of our lost investment or in some cases could result in certain losses being totally uninsured. As a result, we could lose some or all of the capital we have invested in a property, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property, and we could remain obligated for debt or other financial obligations related to the property, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may be subject to litigation which, if adversely determined, could expose us to significant liabilities, damage our reputation and result in substantial losses.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in a variety of lawsuits, claims, investigations and other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings concerning labor and employment matters, personal injury claims, breach of contract claims, commercial disputes, business practices, intellectual property, tax and other matters. See Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for additional information. Certain litigation claims may not be covered entirely or at all by our insurance policies, or our insurance carriers may seek to deny coverage. In addition, litigation claims can be expensive to defend and may divert our attention from the operations of our businesses. Further, litigation involving visitors to our properties, even if without merit, can attract adverse media attention.\nWe evaluate all litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves and/or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. We caution you that actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from those envisioned by our current assessments and estimates. As a result, litigation can have a significant adverse effect on our businesses and, because we cannot predict the outcome of any action, it is possible that adverse judgments or settlements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe depend on a limited number of key employees who would be difficult to replace.\nWe depend on a limited number of key personnel to manage and operate our business, including our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Operating Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. We believe our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. The competition for these types of personnel is intense and we compete with other potential employers for the services of our employees. As a result, we may not succeed in hiring and retaining the executives and other employees that we need. An inability to hire quality employees or the loss of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur executive officers and directors own or control a large percentage of our common stock, which permits them to exercise significant control over us.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our executive officers and directors and entities affiliated with them owned, in the aggregate, approximately 53% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, these shareholders will be able to substantially influence all matters requiring approval by our shareholders, including the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions and the composition of our Board of Directors. This concentration of ownership may also delay, defer or even prevent a change in control of our company and would make some transactions more difficult or impossible without their support. Circumstances may arise in which the interests of these shareholders could conflict with the interests of our other shareholders.\nOur shareholders may be required to provide information that is requested by gaming authorities and we have the right, under certain circumstances, to redeem a shareholder\u2019s securities; we may be forced to use our cash or incur debt to fund redemption of our securities.\nOur Articles of Incorporation require our shareholders to provide information that is requested by authorities that regulate our current or proposed gaming operations. Our Articles of Incorporation also permit us to redeem the securities held by persons whose status as a security holder, in the opinion of our Board of Directors, jeopardizes our existing gaming licenses or approvals. The price paid for these securities is, in general, the average closing price for the 30 trading days prior to giving notice of redemption.\nIn the event a shareholder\u2019s background or status jeopardizes our current or proposed gaming licensure, we may be required to redeem such shareholder\u2019s securities in order to continue gaming operations or obtain a gaming license. This redemption may divert our cash resources from other productive uses and require us to obtain additional financing which, if in the form of equity financing, would be dilutive to our shareholders. Further, any debt financing may involve additional restrictive covenants and further leveraging of our fixed assets. The inability to obtain additional financing to redeem a disqualified shareholder\u2019s securities may result in the loss of a current or potential gaming license.\nThere is a limited public market for our common stock.\nThere is a limited public market for our common stock. The average daily trading volume in our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately 17,000 shares per day. We cannot provide assurances that a more active trading market will develop or be sustained. As a result of low trading volume in our common stock, the purchase or sale of a relatively small number of shares of our common stock could result in significant price fluctuations and it may be difficult for holders to sell their shares without depressing the market price for our common stock.\nWe expect our stock price to be volatile, and you may lose some or all of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile. The market price of our common stock may be significantly affected by many factors, including:\n\u25cf\nchanges in general or local economic or market conditions;\n\u25cf\nquarterly variations in operating results;\n\u25cf\nstrategic developments by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\ndevelopments in our relationships with our customers, distributors and suppliers;\n\u25cf\nregulatory developments or any breach, revocation or loss of any gaming license;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our revenues, expense levels or profitability;\n\u25cf\nchanges in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; and\n\u25cf\nfailure to meet the expectations of securities analysts.\nAny of these events may cause the market price of our common stock to fall. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced significant volatility, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance.\nFuture sales of our common stock could lower our stock price and dilute existing shareholders.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock to finance future acquisitions through the use of equity. For example, we issued a total of approximately 8.5 million shares of our common stock in connection with the Merger. The holder of approximately 8.0 million of such shares has the right to require us to register with the SEC resales of such shares from time to time. In January 2016, we issued a further 50,252 shares of our common stock in a private placement in connection with the acquisition of gaming devices and other non-gaming assets, including the right to operate within certain locations, from a distributed gaming operator in the state of Montana. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options and other equity awards pursuant to our employee benefit plans. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or the effect, if any, that future sales and issuances of shares of our common stock will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued in connection with the Merger, upon the exercise of stock options and warrants or in connection with acquisition financing), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock. In addition, these sales may be dilutive to existing shareholders.\nProvisions in our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, our Rights Plan or the Credit Agreement may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control or prevent an acquisition of our business at a premium price.\nSome of the provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and our Bylaws and Minnesota law could discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of our business, even if a change in control would be beneficial to the interests of our shareholders and was made at a premium price. These provisions:\n\u25cf\npermit our Board of Directors to increase its own size and fill the resulting vacancies;\n\u25cf\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that our Board of Directors could issue to increase the number of outstanding shares to discourage a takeover attempt; and\n\u25cf\npermit shareholder action by written consent only if the consent is signed by all shareholders entitled to notice of a meeting.\nAlthough we have amended our Bylaws to provide that Section 302A.671 (Control Share Acquisitions) of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act does not apply to or govern us, we remain subject to 302A.673 (Business Combinations) of the Minnesota Business Corporation Act, which generally prohibits us from engaging in business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d shareholder for a period of four years following the shareholder\u2019s share acquisition date, which may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company.\nOn January 25, 2015, our Board of Directors amended and restated our Rights Agreement to help protect our ability to utilize the tax benefits of certain of our NOLs. The rights under the Rights Agreement continue in effect until July 31, 2018 unless, prior to such time, our Board has determined that the NOLs are no longer available to be utilized or are immaterial to our business. Under the Rights Agreement, rights to purchase common stock were issued to holders of common stock as of December 12, 2013, the original date of adoption of the agreement, and to all shares of common stock issued subsequent to that date. These rights become exercisable under certain circumstances in which someone acquires 5% or more, subject to certain exceptions, of our outstanding common stock. As a result of the Rights Agreement, anyone wishing to take over the company may be forced under certain circumstances to negotiate a transaction with our Board and management or comply with certain bid criteria in order not to trigger the exercise of rights. The need to negotiate with our Board or management or to comply with certain bid criteria could add complexity to a proposed takeover. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for an event of default upon the occurrence of certain specified change of control events.", "PERMNO": 86578, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "GDEN"}
