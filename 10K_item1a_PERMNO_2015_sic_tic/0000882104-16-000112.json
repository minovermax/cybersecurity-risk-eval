RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included and incorporated by reference in this Annual Report, including the risk factors listed below. Any of these risks, as well as other risks and uncertainties, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, which in turn could materially and adversely affect the trading price of shares of our common stock. Additional risks not currently known or currently material to us may also harm our business. Keep these risk factors in mind when you read forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report and the documents incorporated by reference in this Annual Report. These statements relate to our expectations about future events and time periods. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cpredicts,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d \u201ccontinue\u201d or \u201copportunity,\u201d the negative of these words or words of similar import. Similarly, statements that describe our reserves and our future plans, strategies, intentions, expectations, objectives, goals or prospects are also forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and future events and circumstances could differ significantly from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.\nWe have historically derived a significant portion of our royalty revenues from Genentech and other Queen et al. patent licensees which, in the case of our largest licensee, Genentech, are scheduled to expire in early 2016. Failure to acquire additional sources of revenue, including royalty revenue, after expiration of our Queen et al. patents and the related licenses may cause us to have insufficient revenues and positive cash flows to continue operations.\nOur revenues to date have consisted almost entirely of royalties from licensees of our Queen et al. patents, which expired in December 2014. Of this revenue from licensees, for example, the Genentech Products accounted for 70%, 71% and 81% of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our license agreement with Genentech expires in the first quarter of 2016, and our other licensees, and efforts to identify and replace those sources of revenues in the future might not be successful. Failure to replace Queen et al. patent licensee revenues in an amount sufficient to continue our operations would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business plan is to continue to acquire additional income generating assets. However, we do not expect that these acquisitions will, in the near term, replace the revenues we generate from our license agreements related to the Queen et al. patents. Specifically, in 2016, our revenues are likely to materially decrease after we stop receiving payments from these Queen et al. patents license agreements, and the continued success of the Company will become more dependent on the timing and our ability to acquire new income-generating assets in order to generate revenues going forward and support the business model for the Company. We may be unable to acquire sufficient income-generating assets for a number of reasons, including the fact that the acquisition of royalty or other income-generating assets in the healthcare industry is a highly competitive area in which other companies, financial institutions and private funds compete for assets of interest to us. Those entities may have access to lower costs of capital, strategic opportunities or competitive advantages that may not be available to us. Other factors that may prevent us from acquiring favorable income generating assets include the following:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to acquire income generating assets on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate level of return from the asset;\n\u2022\nour asset investments may be less successful in the marketplace than may be necessary to generate an appropriate level of return from the asset; or\n\u2022\nwe may be forced to undertake more risk in obtaining the assets we pursue.\nIf we are unable to acquire suitable income generating assets in the near term, our business may suffer and we may determine that a wind-down, sale, or liquidation of the Company is in the best interests of our stockholders.\nOur current and future acquisitions of other material income generating asset transactions may not produce anticipated revenues, and if such transactions are secured by collateral, we may be, or may become, under-secured by the collateral or such collateral may lose value and we will not be able recuperate our capital expenditures in the acquisition.\nWe are engaged in a continual review of opportunities to acquire income generating assets, whether royalty-based or otherwise, or to acquire companies that hold royalty or other income generating assets. We currently, and generally at any time, have acquisition opportunities in various stages of active review, including, for example, our engagement of consultants and advisors to analyze particular opportunities, technical, financial and other confidential information, submission of indications of interest and involvement as a bidder in competitive auctions or other processes for the acquisition of income generating assets. Many potential acquisition targets do not meet our criteria, and for those that do, we may face significant competition for these acquisitions from other financial investors and enterprises whose cost of capital may be lower than ours. Competition for future asset acquisition opportunities in our markets is competitive and we may be forced to increase the price we pay for such assets or face reduced potential acquisition opportunities. In addition, seven out of fifteen of our acquisitions to date have been or are dependent on, or\nsecured by, a single product revenue stream, which increases the risk of payments based on the competitive factors in the market as well as the pricing of the product. The success of our income generating asset acquisitions is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation, timing and amount of payments, which is highly complex and uncertain. The failure of any of these acquisitions to produce anticipated revenues may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of these income generating acquisitions expose us to credit risk in the event of default by the counterparty, and we expect the credit-based mix of assets in our portfolio to increase in the future. To mitigate this risk, on occasion, we may obtain a security interest as collateral in the assets of such counterparty. Our credit risk in respect of such counterparty may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount we are due pursuant to the terms of the particular income generating assets. This could occur in circumstances where the original collateral was not sufficient to cover a complete loss (e.g., our interests were only partially secured) or may result from the deterioration in value of the collateral, so that, in either such case, we are unable to recover our full capital outlay and any anticipated return. Any such losses resulting therefrom could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties may be unable to maintain regulatory approvals for currently licensed products, or to obtain regulatory approvals or favorable pricing for new products, and they may voluntarily remove currently licensed products from marketing and commercial distribution. Any of such events, whether due to safety issues or other factors, could reduce our revenues.\nOur licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties are subject to stringent regulation with respect to product safety and efficacy by various international, federal, state and local authorities. Of particular significance are the FDA requirements covering research and development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling and promotion of drugs for human use in the United States. As a result of these requirements, the length of time, the level of expenditures and the laboratory and clinical information required for approval of a biologic license application or new drug application are substantial and can require a number of years. In addition, even if our licensees\u2019, borrowers' and royalty-agreement counterparties' products receive regulatory approval, they remain subject to ongoing FDA and other international regulations including, but not limited to, obligations to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing, changes to the product label, new or revised regulatory requirements for manufacturing practices, written advisements to physicians and/or a product recall or withdrawal. Our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties may not maintain necessary regulatory approvals for their existing licensed products or our licensees may not obtain necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all, for any of the licensed products our licensees are developing or manufacturing. Moreover, the current political environment in the U.S. is focused on potential reductions in pricing for pharmaceutical and other health care products, which may negatively impact any existing or new products from which our revenues would be derived. The occurrence of adverse events reported by any licensee, borrower or royalty-agreement counterparty may result in the revocation of regulatory approvals or decreased sales of the applicable product due to a change in physicians\u2019 willingness to prescribe, or patients\u2019 willingness to use the applicable product. Our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties could also choose to voluntarily remove their licensed products from marketing and commercial distribution. In any of these cases, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected. For example, in November 2011, the FDA removed the indication for breast cancer from Avastin\u2019s label. In 2005, Tysabri, was temporarily suspended and then returned to the market. In such cases, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, the current regulatory framework could change, or additional regulations could arise at any stage during our licensees\u2019 product development or marketing which may affect our licensees\u2019 ability to obtain or maintain approval of their licensed products. Delays in our licensees receiving regulatory approval for licensed products or their failure to maintain existing regulatory approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMany of our potential income generating investments are in companies or assets that have limited commercialized revenue-generating products or are dependent on the actions of unrelated third parties, which may negatively impact our investment returns.\nIn anticipation of the expiration of some or all of our Queen et al. patents and related license payments in 2016, we have made and will likely continue to make investments in income generating assets, such as loans in exchange for a profit share or royalty streams, in the healthcare industries, many of which investments are in companies that, at the time of investment, have limited or no commercialized revenue-generating products. If the assets are not successfully commercialized, the value of our investments would be negatively affected and our investment returns would be negatively impacted. The ultimate success of our investments in many of our potential income generating assets in these industries will depend on the ability of our counterparty or their licensees to innovate, develop and commercialize their products, in increasingly competitive and highly regulated markets. Their inability to do so would negatively affect our investment. In addition, in connection with many of our potential income generating\ninvestments, we are dependent, to a large extent, on third parties to enforce certain rights for our benefit. For example, we acquired certain royalty rights from Depomed, which, as the licensor of certain patents, retains various rights, including the contractual right to audit its licensees and to ensure those licensees are complying with the terms of the underlying license agreements. Depomed also retains full responsibility to protect and maintain the intellectual property rights underlying the licenses. While we have contractual rights to require Depomed to take action regarding many of these rights, because Depomed\u2019s economic interest in the license agreements is limited, it may not enforce or protect those rights as it otherwise would have had it retained the full economic interest in the payments under the license agreements. Moreover, in respect of the royalty stream relating to the Glumetza diabetes medication that we acquired from Depomed, which is the royalty right producing the highest revenues from our Depomed acquired royalties, a single generic manufacturer entered the market in February 2016 and two additional generic manufacturers will be permitted to enter the market starting in August 2016 as provided for in settlement agreements between Depomed and these generic manufacturers. We were aware of these settlement agreements, considered them in the cost of the acquiring this asset and expect the entry of these generic products to reduce our Glumetza revenues.\nOur licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties face significant market pressures with respect to their products, and the amount of royalties we receive are subject to various competitive and market factors that may be outside of our control.\nOur licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties face competition from other pharmaceutical, biotechnology, device and diagnostic companies. The introduction of new competitive products may result in lost market share for our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties, reduced use of their products, lower prices and/or reduced product sales, any of which could reduce our royalty revenues, or the revenues on which we rely to produce the returns on our acquisitions, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe amount of any royalties and returns on our investments that we receive will depend on many factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe timing and availability of generic product competition for our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nthe size of the market for our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nthe extent and effectiveness of the sales and marketing and distribution support our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nthe existence of novel or superior products to our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nthe availability of reduced pricing and discounts applicable to our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nstocking and inventory management practices related to our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nlimitations on indications for which our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products can be marketed; the competitive landscape for approved products and developing therapies that compete with our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nthe ability of patients to be able to afford our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products or obtain health care coverage that covers those products;\n\u2022\nacceptance of, and ongoing satisfaction with, our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products by the care providers, patients receiving therapy and third party payors; or\n\u2022\nthe unfavorable outcome of any potential litigation relating to our licensees, borrowers and royalty-agreement counterparties\u2019 products.\nFor example, in 2015, Valeant Pharmaceuticals announced two price increases on Glumetza, a royalty-bearing product under our Depomed Royalty Agreement. The impact of Valeant\u2019s price adjustments on our Depomed royalty entitlement is difficult to predict. While the price increases would be expected to increase revenues and thus our royalties, the entry of one generic manufacturer into this market in February of 2016 and two additional generic manufacturers in August 2016 will likely result in a significant reduction in market share for Glumetza. Due to the uncertainties caused by the price increases and generic competition, we may not be able to accurately estimate the impact on royalties on such sales paid to PDL.\nOur licensees must protect their intellectual property rights for us to succeed.\nOur success is dependent in significant part on the ability of third parties in control of the assets in which we've invested to protect the scope, validity and enforceability of their intellectual property, including the patents, SPCs and license agreements, all of which support our revenues. The scope, validity, enforceability and effective term of patents and SPCs can be highly uncertain\nand often involve complex legal and factual questions and proceedings. In addition, the legal principles applicable to patents in any given jurisdiction may be altered through changing court precedent and legislative action, and such changes may affect the scope, strength and enforceability of our patent rights or the nature of proceedings which may be brought related to the relevant patent rights. A finding in a proceeding related to patent rights which support our revenues which narrows the scope or which affects the validity or enforceability of some or all of our patent rights could have a material impact on our ability to continue to collect royalty payments from our investments or collect revenue from our income generating investments.\nOur common stock may lose value, our common stock could be delisted from NASDAQ and our business may be liquidated due to several factors, including the expiration of our Queen et al. patents, the failure to acquire additional sources of revenue, the payment of dividends or distributions to our stockholders and failure to meet analyst expectations.\nOur revenues to date have consisted mostly of royalties from licensees of our Queen et al. patents, which expired in December of 2014, although we have agreements in place that extended certain license payments related to the Queen et al. patents, particularly those from Genentech, until the first quarter of 2016. The approaching expiration of our license payments related to the Queen et al. patents and its effect on our dividend policy will likely reduce the price of our common stock. If the price of our common stock were to fall and remain below NASDAQ listing standards, our common stock may be delisted. If our common stock were delisted, market liquidity for our common stock could be severely affected and our stockholders\u2019 ability to sell securities in the secondary market could be limited. Delisting from NASDAQ would negatively affect the value of our common stock. Delisting could also have other negative results, including, but not limited to, the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nOur revenues in Europe depend on the validity and enforceability of our SPCs and an adverse judgment could reduce our future revenues.\nOur \u2018216B Patent in Europe was granted in 1996 by the EPO. The \u2018216B Patent expired on December 28, 2009. To extend the period of enforceability of the \u2018216B Patent against specific products which received marketing approval in Europe as of the expiration date of the \u2018216B Patent, we applied for SPCs in various European national patent offices to cover the SPC Products to the extent these products are made and/or sold in Europe. While these SPCs generally expired in 2014, they continue to confer rights upon which we receive royalties until the first quarter of 2016.\nOur SPCs extended the period of enforceability of our \u2018216B Patent against the SPC Products, but their enforcement will be subject to varying, complex and evolving national requirements and standards relevant to enforcement of patent claims pursuant to SPCs. In the event that our SPCs are challenged in the national patent offices or national courts of the various countries in Europe in which we own granted SPCs, such a challenge could be directed against the validity of the SPC, the validity of the underlying patent claims, whether the product named in the SPC is protected by the underlying patent in accordance with controlling European law and/or whether the SPC was properly granted pursuant to controlling European law. Such a proceeding would involve complex legal and factual questions. In addition, the European Court of Justice has the authority to interpret the SPC regulation and could do so in a manner that materially impacts the enforceability of our SPCs against the SPC Products. As a result of these factors, we are unable to predict the extent of protection afforded by our SPCs.\nWe depend on our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties for the determination of royalty payments. While we have rights to audit our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties, the independent auditors may have difficulty determining the correct royalty calculation, we may not be able to detect errors and payment calculations may call for retroactive adjustments. We may have to exercise legal remedies to resolve any disputes resulting from the audit.\nThe royalty payments we receive are determined by our licensees based on their reported sales. Each licensee's calculation of the royalty payments is subject to and dependent upon the adequacy and accuracy of its sales and accounting functions, and errors may occur from time to time in the calculations made by a licensee. Our license and royalty agreements provide us the right to audit the calculations and sales data for the associated royalty payments; however, such audits may occur many months following our recognition of the royalty revenue, may require us to adjust our royalty revenues in later periods and may require expense on the part of the Company. Further, our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties may be uncooperative or have insufficient records, which may complicate and delay the audit process.\nAlthough we regularly exercise our royalty audit rights, we rely in the first instance on our licensees and royalty-agreement counterparties to accurately report sales and calculate and pay applicable royalties and, upon exercise of such royalty audit rights, we rely on licensees' and royalty-agreement counterparties' cooperation in performing such audits. In the absence of such cooperation, we may be forced to exercise legal remedies to enforce our agreements.\nThe lack of liquidity for the assets in our acquisitions may adversely affect our business and, if we need to sell any of our acquired assets, we may not be able to do so at a favorable price. As a result, we may suffer losses.\nWe generally acquire patents, royalty rights and debt instruments that have limited secondary resale markets. The illiquidity of most of our assets may make it difficult for us to dispose of them at a favorable price and, as a result, we may suffer losses if we are required to dispose of any or all such assets in a liquidation or otherwise. In addition, if we liquidate all or a portion of our assets quickly or in connection with a liquidation, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we had previously recorded these assets.\nWe may use a certain amount of cash from time to time in order to satisfy the obligations relating to our convertible notes. The maturity or conversion of any of our convertible notes may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results, which could adversely affect the amount or timing of dividends to our stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2015, $246.4 million in principal remained outstanding under our February 2018 Notes that requires us to repay the full principal amount on February 1, 2018 if not previously converted.\nHolders of the February 2018 Notes may convert their notes at their option under the following circumstances at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding August 1, 2017: (i) during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2014, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days in a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter exceeds 130% of the conversion price for the notes on the last day of such preceding fiscal quarter; (ii) during the five business-day period immediately after any five consecutive trading-day period, which we refer to as the measurement period, in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of that measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the notes for each such day; or (iii) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. The February 2018 Notes are not currently convertible. These notes are net-share settled. If one or more holders elect to convert their notes when conversion is permitted, we would be required to make cash payments to satisfy up to the face value of our conversion obligation in respect of each note, which could adversely affect our liquidity.\nWe may use a certain amount of cash from time to time in order to satisfy repurchase or other obligations relating to our convertible notes which could adversely affect the amount or timing of any distribution to our stockholders or any income generating transactions. In addition, we may redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire the convertible notes in the open market in the future, any of which could adversely affect the amount or timing of any cash distribution to our stockholders.\nThe conversion or any future exchanges of any of the February 2018 Notes into shares of our common stock would have a dilutive effect that could cause our stock price to go down.\nUntil August 1, 2017, the February 2018 Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock only if specified conditions are met and thereafter convertible at any time, at the option of the holder. We have reserved shares of our authorized common stock for issuance upon conversion of these convertible notes. Upon conversion, the principal amount is due in cash, and to the extent that the conversion value exceeds the principal amount, the difference is due in shares of common stock. If any or all of these convertible notes are converted into shares of our common stock, our existing stockholders will experience immediate dilution of voting rights and our common stock price may decline. Furthermore, the perception that such dilution could occur may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe entered into purchased call option and warrant transactions in connection with the issuance of each of our February 2018 Notes that may affect the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the issuance of the February 2018 Notes, we entered into purchased call option transactions. Separately, we also entered into warrant transactions at that time. The purchased call option transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution with respect to our common stock upon conversion of the February 2018 Notes. The warrants in connection with these purchased call option transactions could separately have a dilutive effect from the issuance of our common stock pursuant to the warrants.\nThe purchased call option and warrant transactions are accounted for as an adjustment to our stockholders\u2019 equity. In connection with hedging these transactions, the counterparties to the hedge transactions or their respective affiliates may enter into, or may unwind, various derivative transactions and/or purchase or sell our common stock in secondary market transactions prior to maturity of the February 2018 Notes (and are likely to do so during any cash settlement averaging period related to any\nconversion of the February 2018 Notes). Such activities could have the effect of decreasing the trading price of our common stock during any cash settlement averaging period related to a conversion of the February 2018 Notes.\nIn addition, we intend to exercise the purchased call options whenever February 2018 Notes are converted, if ever. In order to unwind their hedge positions with respect to those exercised options, the hedge counterparties or their respective affiliates may sell shares of our common stock in secondary market transactions or unwind various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock during the cash settlement averaging period for the converted notes. The effect, if any, of any of these transactions and activities on the trading price of our common stock will depend, in part, on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time, but any of these activities could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nFurther, a failure by the hedge counterparties or their respective affiliates (due to bankruptcy or otherwise) to pay or deliver, as the case may be, amounts owed to us under the purchased call option transactions will not reduce the consideration we are required to deliver to a holder upon its conversion of the February 2018 Notes and may result in an increase in dilution with respect to our common stock.\nChanges in the third-party reimbursement environment may affect product sales from which we receive royalty revenues.\nSales of products from which we receive royalties and our borrowers generate revenues will depend significantly on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatments will be available to physicians and patients from various levels of United States and international government health authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Third-party payers and government health administration authorities increasingly attempt to limit and/or regulate the reimbursement of medical products and services, including branded prescription drugs. Changes in government legislation or regulation, such as the Affordable Care Act; the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010; the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2009 and the Medicare, Medicaid and State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program Extension Act of 2007 and changes in formulary or compendia listing or changes in private third-party payers\u2019 policies toward reimbursement for such products may reduce reimbursement of the cost of such products to physicians, pharmacies and distributors. Decreases in third-party reimbursement could reduce usage of such products and sales to collaborators, which may have a material adverse effect on our royalties and the revenues of our borrowers. In addition, macroeconomic factors may affect the ability of patients to pay or co-pay for costs or otherwise pay for products from which we generate royalties and our borrowers generate revenues by, for example, decreasing the number of patients covered by insurance policies or increasing costs associated with such policies.\nWe have implemented a corporate structure taking into consideration our limited operations and potentially applicable tax impact on our royalty and other income, and any changes in applicable tax laws and regulations or enforcement positions of tax authorities may negatively impact our financial condition and operating results.\nWe have established our corporate structure to be closely aligned with the financial nature of our business. There can be no assurance that the applicable tax laws and regulations will continue in effect or that the taxing authorities in any or all of the applicable jurisdictions will not challenge one or more aspects or characterizations of our corporate structure and the treatment of transactions or agreements within our corporate structure, or determine that the manner in which we operate our business is not consistent with our corporate structure. We may also have disputes with one or more state tax authorities regarding whether the Company is subject to that state\u2019s tax and, if the Company is subject to such state\u2019s tax, what proportion of the Company\u2019s revenues is subject to taxation in such state. For example, we are currently subject to an audit by the California Franchise Tax Board and, while we may disagree with their conclusions regarding such issues, the proceedings extend over long periods of time and we may ultimately be required to pay taxes either in a settlement or a final decision of an agency or court. Any unfavorable changes in laws and regulations or positions by tax authorities could harm our financial position and results of operations.\nWe may experience increases and decreases in our royalty revenues due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and we may be unsuccessful in our attempts to mitigate this risk.\nA material portion of our royalties are calculated based on sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currency rates, particularly the Euro, relative to the U.S. dollar can significantly affect our revenues and operating results. While foreign currency conversion terms vary by license agreement, generally most agreements require that royalties first be calculated in the currency of sale and then converted into U.S. dollars using the average daily exchange rates for that currency for a specified period at the end of the calendar quarter. For example, when the U.S. dollar weakens in relation to other currencies, the converted amount is greater than it would have been had the U.S. dollar exchange rates remained unchanged. More than 50% of our licensees\u2019 product sales are in currencies other than U.S. dollars; as such, our revenues may fluctuate due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and is subject to foreign currency exchange risk. For example, in a quarter in which we generate $70 million in royalty revenues and when approximately $35 million is based on sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, if the\nU.S. dollar strengthens across all currencies by 10% during the conversion period for that quarter, when compared to the same amount of local currency royalties for the prior year, U.S. dollar converted royalties will be approximately $3.5 million less in the current quarter than in the prior year.\nTo compensate for Euro currency fluctuations, we hedge Euro currency exposures with Euro forward and option contracts, to offset the risks associated with these Euro currency exposures. We may suspend the use of these contracts from time to time or we may be unsuccessful in our attempt to hedge our Euro currency risk. We will continue to experience foreign currency related fluctuations in our royalty revenues in certain instances when we do not enter into foreign currency exchange contracts or where it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our foreign currency related exposures. Currency related fluctuations in our royalty revenues will vary based on the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency exchange contracts to offset these exposures and other factors. All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows, the timing of which is variable and generally outside of our control.\nWe must attract, retain and integrate key employees in order to succeed. It may be difficult to recruit, retain and integrate key employees.\nTo be successful, we must attract, retain and integrate qualified personnel. Our business is intellectual property asset management and acquisition, investing in income generating assets and maximizing the value of our patent portfolio and related assets, which requires only a small number of employees. Due to the remote location of our company, it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain qualified personnel. If we are unsuccessful in attracting, retaining and integrating qualified personnel, our business could be impaired.\nOur agreements with Facet may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm\u2019s-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties.\nThe agreements associated with the Spin-Off of Facet in December 2008, including the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tax Sharing and Indemnification Agreement and Cross License Agreement, were negotiated in the context of the Spin-Off while Facet was still part of PDL and, accordingly, may not reflect more favorable terms that may have resulted from arm\u2019s-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties.\nWe may have obligations for which we may not be able to collect under our indemnification rights from Facet.\nUnder the terms of the Separation and Distribution agreement with Facet, we and Facet agreed to indemnify the other from and after the Spin-Off with respect to certain indebtedness, liabilities and obligations that were retained by our respective companies. These indemnification obligations could be significant. The ability to satisfy these indemnities, if called upon to do so, will depend upon the future financial strength of each of our companies. We cannot assure you that, if Facet has to indemnify us for any substantial obligations, Facet will have the ability to satisfy those obligations. If Facet does not have the ability to satisfy those obligations, we may be required to satisfy those obligations instead. For example, in connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into amendments to the leases for the facilities in Redwood City, California, which formerly served as our corporate headquarters, under which Facet was added as a co-tenant under the leases and a Co-Tenancy Agreement under which Facet agreed to indemnify us for all matters related to the leases attributable to the period after the Spin-Off date. Should Facet default under its lease obligations, we would be held liable by the landlord as a co-tenant and, thus, we have in substance guaranteed the payments under the lease agreements for the Redwood City facilities, the disposition of which could have a material adverse effect on the amount or timing of any distribution to our stockholders. As of December 31, 2015, the total lease payments for the duration of the guarantee, which runs through December 2021, are approximately $67.7 million. We would also be responsible for lease-related payments including utilities, property taxes and common area maintenance that may be as much as the actual lease payments. In April 2010, Abbott Laboratories acquired Facet and renamed the company Abbott Biotherapeutics Corp., and in January 2013, Abbott Biotherapeutics Corp. was renamed AbbVie Biotherapeutics, Inc. and spun off from Abbott as a subsidiary of AbbVie Inc. We do not know how Abbott\u2019s acquisition of Facet will impact our ability to collect under our indemnification rights or whether Facet\u2019s ability to satisfy its obligations will change. In addition, we have limited information rights under the Co-Tenancy Agreement. As a result, we are unable to determine definitively whether Facet continues to occupy the space and whether it has subleased the space to another party or the basis upon which our potential co-tenant obligation may be triggered. See \u201cItem 2 - Properties.\u201d\nAs we continue to develop our business, our mix of assets and our sources of income may require that we register with the SEC as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d in accordance with the Investment Company Act of 1940.\nWe have not been and have no current intention to register as an \"investment company\" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the 40 Act, because we believe the nature of our assets and the sources of our income currently exclude us from the definition of an investment company pursuant to Sections (3)(a)(1)(A) and (3)(a)(1)(C) under the 40 Act and Rule 270.3a-1 of Title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Accordingly, we are not currently subject to the provisions of the 40 Act, such as compliance with the 40 Act\u2019s registration and reporting requirements, capital structure requirements, affiliate transaction restrictions, conflict of interest rules, requirements for disinterested directors, and other substantive provisions. Generally, to avoid being a company that is an \"investment company\" under the 40 Act, it must both: (a) not be or hold itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, and (b) either (i) not be engaged or propose to engage in the business of investing in securities or own or propose to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis or (ii) not\nhave more than 45% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) consist of or more than 45% of its net income after taxes (for the last four fiscal quarters combined) be derived from securities. In addition, we would not be an \u201cinvestment company\u201d if an exception, exemption, or safe harbor under the 40 Act applies.\nWe monitor our assets and income for compliance with the tests under the 40 Act and seek to conduct our business activities to ensure that we do not fall within its definitions of \u201cinvestment company.\u201d If we were to become an \u201cinvestment company\u201d and be subject to the strictures of the 40 Act, the restrictions imposed by the 40 Act would likely require changes in the way we do business and add significant administrative burdens to our operations. In order to ensure that we do not fall within the 40 Act, we may need to take various actions which we might otherwise not pursue. These actions may include restructuring the Company and/or modifying our mixture of assets and income.\nSpecifically, our mixture of debt vs. royalty assets is important to our classification as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d or not. In this regard, while we currently believe that none of the definitions of \u201cinvestment company\u201d apply to us, we may in the future rely on an exception under the 40 Act provided by Section 3(c)(5)(A). To qualify for Section 3(c)(5)(A), as interpreted by the staff of the SEC, we would be required to have at least 55% of our total assets in \"notes, drafts, acceptances, open accounts receivable, and other obligations representing part or all of the sales price of merchandise, insurance, and services\" (or Qualifying Assets). In a no-action letter issued to Royalty Pharma on August 13, 2010, the SEC staff stated that royalty interests are Qualifying Assets under this exception. If the SEC or its staff in the future adopts a contrary interpretation or otherwise restricts the conclusions in the staff's no-action letter such that our royalty interests are no longer Qualifying Assets for purposes of Section 3(c)(5)(A), we could be required to register under the 40 Act.\nThe rules and interpretations of the SEC and the courts, relating to the definition of \"Investment Company\" are highly complex in numerous respects. While, we currently intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company, we can give no assurances that we will not determine it to be in the Company\u2019s and our stockholders\u2019 interest to register as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d, not be deemed an \"investment company\" and not be required to register under the 40 Act.\nWe have in the past and are currently involved in, and expect that in the future we will from time to time be involved in, litigation, either as a defendant or a plaintiff, which could have a negative impact on our operations and results.\nMonitoring and defending against or prosecuting legal actions is time-consuming for our management and may detract from our ability to fully focus our internal resources on our core business goal of acquiring and managing income generating assets. In addition, legal fees and costs incurred in connection with such activities may be significant. Depending on the nature of the lawsuit, a decision adverse to our interests could result in the payment of substantial damages and could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial position or impact our rights in an adverse way.\nFailure in our information technology and storage systems could significantly disrupt the operation of our business.\nOur ability to execute our business plan depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems. IT systems are vulnerable to damage from a variety of sources, including telecommunications or network failures, malicious human acts and natural disasters. Moreover, despite network security and back-up measures, some of our servers may be vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses and similar disruptive problems. Despite the precautionary measures we have taken to prevent unanticipated problems that could affect our IT systems, sustained or repeated system failures that interrupt our ability to generate and maintain data could adversely affect our ability to operate our business.", "PERMNO": 77292, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "PDLI"}
