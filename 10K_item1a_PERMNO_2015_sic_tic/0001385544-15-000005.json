RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which we have made forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that we do not currently consider to be significant that may adversely affect our business, performance or financial condition in the future.\nRisks related to our business\nWe may be unable to resolve the operational issues that have delayed ramp-up of production at our new zinc facility or experience new issues that may cause further delays, each of which would materially harm our profitability, liquidity, financial condition and operations.\nIn April 2014, we permanently closed our Monaca, Pennsylvania facility and in May 2014, we began production at our new zinc facility. Our new zinc facility has experienced operational difficulties that have resulted in production interruptions and have delayed the ramp-up to full production. We believe our new zinc facility is capable of producing over 155,000 tons of zinc metal per year; however, the facility produced approximately 12,000 tons of zinc metal in the fourth quarter of 2014, approximately 4,300 tons in the third quarter of 2014 and approximately 3,400 tons in the second quarter of 2014. The primary bottleneck thus far has been the removal of solids at the front end of the process. We have made progress through better control of the process and by equipment modifications and the facility has been operating continuously since early August 2014. During January 2015, we produced approximately 4,600 tons of zinc metal. We reduced the plating rate for several days in January to perform some needed maintenance in the cell house. We also experienced intermittent equipment reliability issues, particularly with some key pumps, which were further exacerbated by recent extreme cold weather conditions. On February 20, 2015, we began a planned seven day outage to address several of these issues. We expect to ramp-up production following this outage. Our interim target is to demonstrate that no bottlenecks exist to operating the facility at 75% of nameplate capacity, or 330 tons per day, by the end of the first quarter of 2015. We believe that our ability to achieve this higher level of production will depend primarily on the\nabsence of further unplanned equipment issues. We cannot guarantee that our efforts to remediate known issues will be sufficient or that we will not encounter additional issues that may result in further delays. We are also unable to foresee the severity of any such issues. If we are unable to continue to increase production levels and sustain such levels of production, our profitability, liquidity, financial condition and operations would be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not have sufficient funds to correct operational issues experienced by our new zinc facility.\nIf we are not able to correct the operational issues currently experienced by our new zinc facility, if new unforeseen operational issues appear, or if the costs of correcting such issues is greater than expected, we could require additional financing, which we may not be able to obtain on acceptable terms in a timely manner or at all. If we cannot obtain additional financing to address any operational issues at our new zinc facility, our liquidity, financial condition and operations would be materially adversely affected.\nThe projected benefits from the new zinc facility may fail to materialize.\nThe benefits that we project to receive from the new zinc facility are based on numerous assumptions, and if these assumptions are incorrect, it could negatively impact such projected benefits. The technology that we are using at this new zinc facility has only been implemented in a limited number of production environments, and our assumptions with regard to this technology may be incorrect. Some aspects of the technology in the new zinc facility have not been tested in exactly the same manner on a production scale or the equipment in the new zinc facility may not be operated in exactly the same manner as the other production environments. For example, since we started production in May 2014, although we have been able to produce SHG zinc, we have had periods following operational disruptions during which we have been limited to producing other grades of zinc that sell for less than SHG zinc. If we are not able to remediate these operational issues, our ability to produce SHG zinc could be impaired, reducing the expected revenues from sales and limiting the markets for sales of our zinc metal. We may also not be able to realize the reduced recycling costs or the logistical benefits that come from directly converting WOX to SHG zinc or other grades of zinc. Further, we may be unable to penetrate the market for the SHG zinc or other grades of zinc that we plan to produce.\nThe projected benefits from the new zinc facility are based on numerous assumptions, all of which are subject to change, including the recovery rate and prices of zinc and the other metals we expect to recover, the prices of other metals we expect to sell, energy consumption requirements, energy prices, the number of employees required to operate the new zinc facility and labor and maintenance costs at the new zinc facility, some of which are dependent upon our ability to ramp-up production. The actual incremental benefits that we expect to achieve from our new zinc facility may be significantly less than expected. If any of our assumptions are incorrect, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from the new zinc facility, which could negatively impact our future business and results of operations.\nEquipment or power failures, delays in deliveries or catastrophic loss at any of our facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales, increase our costs and/or negatively impact our results of operations.\nAn interruption in production or service capabilities at any of our production facilities as a result of equipment or power failure or other reasons could limit our ability to deliver products to our customers, reducing our net sales and net income, increasing our costs and potentially damaging relationships with our customers. Any significant delay in deliveries to our customers could lead to increased returns or cancellations, damage to our reputation and/or permanent loss of customers. Any such production stoppage or delay could also require us to make unplanned capital expenditures, which together with reduced sales and increased costs, could adversely affect our results or operations. For instance, since the start-up of our new zinc facility we have encountered operational difficulties that have prevented ramp-up to full production. These operational difficulties have resulted in production interruptions.\nFurthermore, because many of our customers are, to varying degrees, dependent on deliveries from our facilities, customers that have to reschedule their own production due to our missed deliveries could pursue financial claims against us. Our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, adverse weather conditions or other refinery incidents. We have experienced, and may experience in the future, periods of reduced production as a result of repairs that are necessary to our operations. If any of these events occur in the future, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our insurance policies may not cover all of our losses and we could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from, among other things, loss of life, physical damage, business interruptions and product liability.\nThe metals industry is highly cyclical. Fluctuations in the availability of zinc and nickel and in levels of customer demand have historically been severe, and future changes and/or fluctuations could cause us to experience lower sales volumes, which would negatively impact our profit margins.\nThe metals industry is highly cyclical. The length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time and by product but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions, levels of industry capacity and availability of usable raw materials. The overall levels of demand for our products containing zinc or nickel reflect fluctuations in levels of end-user demand, which depend in large part on general macroeconomic conditions in North America and regional economic conditions in our markets. For example, many of the principal consumers of zinc metal and zinc-related products operate in industries such as transportation, construction or general manufacturing, that themselves are heavily dependent on general economic conditions, including the availability of affordable energy sources, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and housing demand. These cyclical shifts in our customers\u2019 industries tend to result in significant fluctuations in demand and pricing for our products and services. As a result, in periods of recession or low economic growth, metals companies, including ours, have generally tended to under-perform compared to other industries. We generally have high fixed costs, so changes in industry demand that impact our production volume also can significantly impact our profit margins and our overall financial condition. Economic downturns in the national and international economies and prolonged recessions in our principal industry segments have had a negative impact on our operations and on those of our predecessor both recently and in the past, and a continuation or further deterioration of current economic conditions could have a negative impact on our future financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in the prices of zinc and nickel will have a significant impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe derive most of our revenue from the sale of zinc and a portion of our revenue from nickel-based products. Changes in the market prices of zinc and nickel impact the selling prices of our products, and therefore our profitability is significantly affected by decreased zinc and nickel prices. Market prices of these metals are dependent upon supply and demand and a variety of factors over which we have little or no control, including:\n\u2022\nU.S. and world economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe balance between supply and demand;\n\u2022\navailability and relative pricing of metal substitutes;\n\u2022\nlabor costs;\n\u2022\nenergy prices;\n\u2022\nenvironmental laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nweather;\n\u2022\nimport and export restrictions; and\n\u2022\nthe effect of financial commodity speculations.\nDeclines in the price of zinc have had a negative impact on our operations in the past, and future declines could have a negative impact on our future financial condition or results of operations. In 2002, record low zinc prices, together with high operational and legacy environmental costs and inefficiencies, caused our predecessor, HII, to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Market conditions beyond our control determine the prices for our products, and the price for any one or more of our products may fall below our production costs, requiring us to either incur short-term losses and/or idle or permanently shut down production capacity. Market prices for zinc and nickel may decrease, and therefore our operating results may be significantly harmed.\nSome of our products and services are vulnerable to long-term declines in demand due to competing technologies, materials or imports, which would significantly reduce our sales.\nOur zinc and nickel-based products compete with other materials in many of their applications. For example, PW zinc is used by steel fabricators in the hot dip galvanizing process, in which steel is coated with zinc in order to protect it from corrosion. Steel fabricators also can use paint, which we do not sell, for corrosion protection. Demand for our zinc as a galvanizing material may shift depending on how customers view the respective merits of hot dip galvanizing and paint. In addition, SHG zinc and CGG zinc are used by continuous galvanizers to produce galvanized flat-rolled sheet steel for the automotive market. There have been recent plans by automotive companies to use lighter weight aluminum sheet to replace galvanized steel. Any such shifts in industry uses could affect our sales.\nOur nickel-based products are used in the stainless steel industry. Demand for our products and services may decline if demand for stainless steel lessens. Nickel-bearing stainless steel faces competition from stainless steels containing a lower level of nickel or no nickel. Domestic production of stainless steel may be negatively impacted by imports.\nIn addition, in periods of high zinc and nickel prices, consumers of these metals may have additional incentives to invest in the development of technologically viable substitutes for zinc and nickel-based products. Similarly, customers may develop ways to manufacture their products by using less zinc and nickel-based material than they do currently. If one or more of our customers successfully identify alternative products that can be substituted for our zinc or nickel-based products, or find ways to reduce their zinc or nickel consumption, our sales to those and other customers would likely decline.\nDemand for our EAF dust or nickel-bearing waste recycling operations may decline to the extent that steel mini-mill producers identify less expensive or more convenient alternatives for the disposal of their EAF dust or nickel-bearing waste or if the EPA were to no longer classify EAF dust as a listed hazardous waste. We may in the future face increased competition from other EAF dust or nickel-bearing waste recyclers, including new entrants into those recycling markets, or from landfills implementing more effective disposal techniques. Furthermore, our current recycling customers may seek to capitalize on the value of the EAF dust or nickel-bearing waste produced by their operations, or may seek to recycle their material themselves, or reduce the price they pay to us for the material they deliver to us. Any of these developments would have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe may be unable to compete effectively against manufacturers of zinc and nickel products in one or more of our markets, which would limit our market share or reduce our sales and our operating profit margins.\nWe face intense competition from regional, national and global companies in each of the markets we serve, where we face also the potential for future entrants and competitors. We compete on the basis of product quality, on-time delivery performance and price, with price representing a more important factor for our larger customers and for sales of standard zinc products than for smaller customers and customers to whom we sell value-added zinc-based products. Our competitors include other independent zinc producers as well as vertically integrated zinc companies that mine and produce zinc. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Our competitors may also foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do, sell products at a lower price than we can and/or adapt more quickly to new technologies or industry and customer requirements. We operate in a global marketplace, and zinc metal imports have historically represented approximately 75% of U.S. zinc metal consumption.\nIn the future, foreign zinc metal producers may develop new ways of packaging and transporting zinc metal that could mitigate the freight cost and other shipping limitations that we believe currently limit their ability to more fully penetrate the U.S. zinc market. If our customers in any of the end-user markets we serve were to shift their production outside the United States and Canada, then those customers would likely source zinc overseas, and, as a result, our net sales and results of operations would be adversely affected. If we cannot compete other than by reducing prices, we may lose market share and suffer reduced profit margins. If our competitors lower their prices, it could inhibit our ability to compete for customers with higher value-added sales and could lead to a reduction in our sales volumes and profit. If our product mix changed as a result of competitive pricing, it could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay the notes or other debt we may occur.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal or pay interest on or to refinance our 3.80% Convertible Notes (the \"Convertible Notes\"), our 10.50% Senior Secured Notes (the \"Senior Secured Notes\"), our 9.00% Senior Unsecured Notes (the \"Unsecured Notes\"), our credit facilities or other indebtedness we may incur, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control including a delay to ramp-up production at our new zinc facility because of our inability to correct current operational issues or future unforeseen operational issues. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on the Convertible Notes, the Senior Secured Notes, the Unsecured Notes, our credit facilities or other debt obligations we may incur.\nWork stoppages and other labor matters could interrupt our production or increase our costs, either of which would negatively impact our operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had 747 employees, 281, or approximately 38%, of whom were covered by six union contracts. The collective bargaining agreements for our Palmerton, Pennsylvania and Rockwood, Tennessee facilities expire in April and July of 2015 and the rest of our collective bargaining agreements expire between 2016 and 2017. We may be unable to resolve any present or future contract negotiations without work stoppages or significant increases in costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and operating results. We may be unable to maintain satisfactory relationships with our employees and their unions, and we may encounter strikes, further unionization efforts or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees, which may interfere with our production or increase our costs, either of which would negatively impact our operating results.\nFluctuations in the cost or availability of electricity, coke, and/or natural gas would lead to higher manufacturing costs, thereby reducing our profit margins and limiting our cash flows from operations.\nEnergy is one of our most significant costs, comprising approximately $55 million of our production costs during 2014 at our Monaca facility until its permanent closure in April 2014, our Mooresboro facility since it's startup of operations in May 2014 and our recycling facilities. Our processes rely on electricity, coke and natural gas in order to operate, and our freight operations depend heavily on the availability of diesel fuel. Energy prices, particularly for electricity, natural gas, coke and diesel fuel, have been volatile and have exceeded historical averages in recent years. These fluctuations impact our manufacturing costs and contribute to earnings volatility. We estimate that a hypothetical 10% increase in electricity, natural gas and coke costs would have reduced our income from operations by approximately $5.5 million for 2014. In addition, at most of our facilities we do not maintain sources of secondary power, and therefore any prolonged interruptions in the supply of energy to our facilities could result in lengthy production shutdowns, increased costs associated with restarting production and waste of production in progress. We have experienced rolling power outages in the past, and any future outages would reduce our production capacity, reducing our net sales and potentially impacting our ability to deliver products to our customers.\nIf we were to lose order volumes from any of our major customers, our sales could decline significantly and our cash flows may be reduced.\nIn 2014, our ten largest customers were responsible for 44% of our consolidated sales. In 2014, three of INMETCO\u2019s customers provided 77% of its sales. A loss of order volumes from, or a loss of industry share by, any major customer could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations by lowering sales volumes, increasing costs and lowering profitability. In addition, some of our customers could become involved in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings and could default on their obligations to us. We may be required to record significant additional reserves for accounts receivable from customers which may have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, approximately 46% by volume of our zinc product shipments in 2013 were to customers who do not have long-term contractual arrangements, and we currently do not have long-term contractual arrangements with our zinc customers because of the current ramp-up process at our new zinc facility. Therefore, zinc customers currently purchase products and services from us on a spot basis and may choose not to continue to purchase our products and services. The loss of these customers or a significant reduction in their purchase orders could have a negative impact on our sales volume and business.\nOur operations are subject to numerous federal and state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of our employees, and changes in health and safety regulation could result in significant costs, which would reduce our profit margins and adversely affect our cash flow from operations.\nWe are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d), and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and customers. We are also subject to federal and state laws regarding operational safety. Costs and liabilities related to worker safety may be incurred and any violation of health and safety laws or regulations could impose substantial costs on us. Possible future developments, including stricter safety laws for workers or others, regulations and enforcement policies and claims for personal injury or property damages resulting from our operations could result in substantial costs and liabilities that could reduce the amount of cash that we would otherwise have to distribute or use to service our indebtedness or further enhance our business.\nIf we fail to implement our business strategy, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur ability to achieve our business and financial objectives is subject to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. For example, factors such as increased competition, legal and regulatory developments, general economic conditions or increased operating costs could prevent us from increasing our capacity, implementing further productivity improvements, investing in technology upgrades or continuing to enhance our business and product mix.\nAn important part of our strategy is to grow our business by expanding our capacity to process EAF dust. One new kiln to process EAF dust was placed into service in 2008 at our Rockwood, Tennessee facility and two new kilns were placed into service in 2010 at our new recycling facility in Barnwell, South Carolina. In addition, we began production at our new zinc facility in May 2014 and may initiate other construction projects in the future. Our costs in connection with construction projects may also increase to levels that would make our facilities unprofitable to operate. Our planned projects may also suffer significant delays or cost overruns as a result of a variety of factors, such as operational issues, shortages of workers or materials, transportation\nconstraints, adverse weather, unforeseen difficulties or labor issues, any of which could prevent us from completing our expansion plans as currently expected. Our project plans may also result in other unanticipated adverse consequences, such as the diversion of management\u2019s attention from our existing operations. Even if we are able to implement our strategy, projected volumes with respect to our products may not materialize to the extent we expect, or at all, resulting in under-utilized capacity. In addition, as part of our business strategy, we seek to identify and enter new markers and to increase our production capacity, product offerings, customers base, operating flexibility and product margins through strategic acquisitions and internal expansion opportunities and have estimated potential investment amounts involved in such opportunities. However, there is no guarantee that we will pursue these opportunities, that the actual investment amounts will equal our estimates or that we will obtain any benefits from these investments, if pursued.\nAny failure to successfully implement our business strategy, including for any of the above reasons, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We may, in addition, decide to alter or discontinue certain aspects of our business strategy at any time.\nCurrent or future credit and financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations in several ways.\nFinancial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia have experienced disruption, including, among other things, volatility in securities prices, diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. Despite improvements in credit and financial markets, there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in these markets and confidence in economic conditions. These economic developments affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways. Tightening of credit in financial markets may delay or prevent our customers from securing funding adequate to honor their existing contracts with us or to enter into new contracts to purchase our products and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products. Our customers may also seek to delay deliveries of our products under existing contracts, which may postpone our ability to recognize revenue on contracts in our order backlog.\nOur business is also adversely affected by decreases in the general level of economic activity, including the levels of purchasing and investment in general. Strengthening of the rate of exchange for the U.S. dollar against certain major currencies may adversely affect our results or may adversely affect our domestic customers\u2019 ability to export their product. We may also face increased risk that the counterparty or clearing agent to a hedging transaction that we enter or have entered into may default on its obligation to pay or deliver under the forward contract. We are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of disruptions in financial markets and sluggish economic conditions in the United States and other countries, and any resulting effects or changes, including those described above, may have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be harmed if we do not successfully manage the integration of businesses that we acquire in the future or we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions we make in the future.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have and may continue to acquire other businesses that complement our core capabilities, including the acquisition of Zochem on November 1, 2011 and HZP on November 16, 2012. The benefits of an acquisition, including our recent acquisitions, may often take considerable time to develop and may not be realized. Business acquisitions entail a number of inherent risks such as:\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key customers and employees of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nthe in-ability to achieve the operating and financial synergies anticipated from an acquisition;\n\u2022\ndisruptions that can arise from the integration of the acquired business; and\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities or other difficulties associated with the acquired businesses.\nAs a result of the aforementioned and other risks, we may not realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions, which could adversely affect our business.\nLitigation related to worker safety or employment laws may result in significant liabilities and limit our profitability.\nWe may be involved in claims and litigation filed on behalf of persons alleging injuries suffered predominantly because of occupational exposure to substances at our facilities, or allegations of violations of laws prohibiting discrimination, or harassment or providing other rights relating to the employment relationship. It is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these claims and lawsuits due to the unpredictable nature of personal injury or employment law litigation. If these claims and lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, were finally resolved against us, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to stringent environmental regulation, which may cause us to incur significant costs and liabilities that could materially harm our operating results.\nOur business is subject to a variety of environmental regulations and our operations expose us to various potential environmental liabilities. For example, we recycle EAF dust, which is listed and regulated as a hazardous waste under the EPA\u2019s solid waste Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\"). Failure to properly process and manage EAF dust could result in significant liability for us, including, among other things, costs for health-related claims or for remediation of hazardous substances in the environment. In addition, as part of the purchase of assets out of bankruptcy, we inherited responsibility for several environmental issues from our predecessor at our Palmerton, Pennsylvania and Bartlesville, Oklahoma facilities. The issues related to our Palmerton, Pennsylvania facility are cited in a 1995 EPA and Pennsylvania Department of Protection (\"PADEP\") consent decree, and the matters relating to our Bartlesville, Oklahoma facility are covered in a RCRA post-closure care permit issued by the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality. A reserve in the amount of $2.2 million was originally established as of December 31, 2010, to cover the cost of construction of a storage building for calcine kiln feed materials at our Palmerton, Pennsylvania facility ($1.5 million) and for ongoing post-closure groundwater monitoring and maintenance activities at our Bartlesville, Oklahoma facility ($0.7 million). The reserve ($1.5 million) for the Palmerton, Pennsylvania facility was removed during 2011 since the PADEP concurred with our assessment that construction of the storage building for calcine feed was not necessary. Consequently, no further reserves have been recorded.\nOur Barnwell, South Carolina facility and our Rockwood, Tennessee facility have been the subject of EPA and state agency investigations alleging violations under RCRA. In connection with these investigations, we are currently working on a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, EPA Region 4, and the state agencies. Although the various agencies have acknowledged our efforts to cooperate with these investigations and the improvements and investments made at the facilities to address identified issues, if a settlement is not reached, the government may seek penalties and/or issue permanent injunctions against us. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to reach a satisfactory settlement on these matters, nor can we anticipate the amount of penalties, if any, that may be involved, or other actions that we may be required to complete.\nWe may also incur costs related to future compliance with or violations of applicable environmental laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, air emission regulations under possible future \u201cMaximum Achievable Control Technology\u201d (\u201cMACT\u201d) rules relating to the Company's operations such as regulations relating to non-ferrous secondary metals production. Our total cost of environmental compliance at any time depends on a variety of regulatory, legal, technical and factual issues, some of which cannot be anticipated. For example, in June 2014, we received a notice and findings of violation from Illinois EPA and EPA Region 5 alleging violations of certain provisions of our Calumet, Illinois facility\u2019s Title V Operating Permit and state and federal air regulations. Although we do not believe that these allegations represent a material risk for us, we believe that the entry into a consent order is likely to occur in this case. We cannot speculate as to the content of the consent order or in any other way guarantee the outcome of these investigations and the impact they could have on our environmental compliance costs. Additional environmental issues could arise, or laws and regulations could be passed and promulgated, resulting in additional costs, which our reserves may not cover and which could materially harm our operating results.\nPotential federal climate change legislation or greenhouse gas regulation could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for our products.\nOver the past several years, Congress has considered legislation that would cap and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases GHGs for most industrial sectors, although to date no major climate change bill has been enacted. In June 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy Security Act of 2009, which was introduced by Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA) and Rep. Edward Markey (D-MA) and commonly known as \u201cWaxman-Markey.\u201d This bill would have established an economy-wide cap-and-trade system for emissions of GHGs, seeking to reduce them 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 and 83% below 2005 levels by 2050. Under Waxman-Markey, sources that emit GHGs would have been required to hold an emission allowance or an offset credit for each carbon dioxide-equivalent ton of a GHG emitted or produced on site. Broadly, Waxman-Markey and similar regulatory programs would likely have resulted in increased costs associated with the production and combustion of carbon-intensive fuels such as coal, oil, refined petroleum products, and gas. This bill was originally passed in the U.S. House, but was defeated in the Senate in 2009. It is possible that similar legislation could be proposed again in the near future.\nIn addition, the EPA has begun regulating GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act (the \"CAA\") in response to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2007 decision in Massachusetts v. EPA. In December 2009, the EPA published its findings that atmospheric concentrations of GHGs endanger public health and welfare pursuant to the CAA and that GHG emissions from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines are contributing to air pollution endangering public health and welfare pursuant to the CAA (the \u201cendangerment finding\u201d). Although these findings do not by themselves impose any requirements with respect to sources emitting\nGHGs and contain no specific emission reduction targets, they have resulted in subsequent efforts by the EPA to regulate GHGs under the CAA.\nFollowing the endangerment finding, the EPA conducted several rulemakings that, if ultimately implemented, would regulate GHGs from certain stationary sources under the CAA. Separately, the EPA has promulgated a series of rulemakings requiring the reporting of GHG emissions. The adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur significant costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations.\nOn October 30, 2009, the EPA promulgated the Final Rule for the Mandatory Reporting of GHG. This rule became effective on December 29, 2009. As part of this rulemaking the EPA identified zinc production as a Source Category consisting of zinc smelters and secondary zinc recycling facilities in Subpart GG of 40 CFR Part 98. This requires the reporting of carbon dioxide (\u201cCO2\u201d), methane (\u201cCH4\u201d), and nitrous oxide (\u201cN2O\u201d) from each Waelz kiln and electrothermic furnace used for zinc production. Additionally CO2, CH4 and N2O from each stationary combustion unit other than the Waelz kilns must also be reported. Starting in 2010, GHG emissions for sources emitting greater than 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalents (CO2(e)) are to be reported into a national database set up by the EPA. Some states such as Pennsylvania are now asking that this also be reported as part of an annual inventory submittal.\nIn addition to the reporting rule on May 13, 2010, the EPA issued a GHG Tailoring Rule that sets thresholds for GHG emissions that define when permits under the New Source Review Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Title V Operating Permit programs are required for new and existing sources. Following judicial challenges to the Tailoring Rule, the United States Supreme Court determined in June 2014, in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, that the CAA does not authorize application of PSD to proposed new stationary sources or major modifications of existing sources if the only pollutants for which the project would be determined to be significant are GHGs. Similarly, the obligation to obtain a Title V Operating Permit would not be triggered for such sources. However, the Court also found that if a source is otherwise required to have a PSD permit based on emissions of conventional, non-GHG pollutants, the permit may contain GHG limits based on the application of Best Available Control Technology standards (BACT), and likewise, Title V Operating Permits may incorporate and assure compliance with GHG BACT limits that remain applicable requirements under a PSD permit issued to such sources. Furthermore, the Court\u2019s ruling does not preclude imposition of GHG permitting requirements at the state level. Although EPA has issued guidance to assist permitting authorities in addressing the implications of the Court\u2019s decision in the short term, additional regulatory revisions are\nanticipated at both the federal and state levels to fully implement the Court\u2019s decision relative to affected permitting programs.\nEPA rules regulating GHG emissions have resulted and will continue to result in electric utilities increasing their rates to pay for compliance measures, and our electric power costs could significantly increase as a result.\nWe believe we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations applicable to our current operations. However, accidental spills or releases or other events may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot give any assurance that we will not incur substantial costs and liabilities as a result of such spills or releases or other events, including those relating to claims for damage to property, persons, natural resources or the environment. Moreover, we cannot give any assurance that the passage of more stringent laws or regulations in the future will not have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur hedging strategies may fail to protect us from changes in the prices for natural gas, zinc and nickel, which could reduce our gross margin and cash flow.\nWe pursue various hedging strategies, including entering into forward purchase contracts and call and put options, in order to reduce our exposure to losses from adverse changes in the prices for natural gas, zinc and nickel. Our hedging activities may fail to protect or could harm our operating results because, among other things:\n\u2022\nhedging can be expensive, particularly during periods of volatile prices;\n\u2022\navailable hedges may not correspond directly with the risks that we are seeking to protect ourselves against;\n\u2022\nthe duration of the hedge may not match the duration of the risk that we are seeking to protect ourselves against;\n\u2022\nthe counterparty or clearing agent to a hedging transaction may default on its obligation to pay or deliver under the forward contract; and\n\u2022\nwe may need to post collateral with counterparties for certain hedging transactions.\nWe depend on the service of key individuals, the loss of whom could materially harm our business.\nOur success will depend, in part, on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees, none of whom are covered by key person insurance policies. These individuals possess sales, marketing, engineering, manufacturing, financial and administrative skills that are critical to the operation of our business. If we lose or suffer an extended interruption in the services of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted. Moreover, the market for qualified individuals may be highly competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel to succeed members of our management team or other key employees, should the need arise.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property, particularly our proprietary technology related to the recycling of EAF dust and the processing of nickel-bearing materials. Our market share and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe rely upon proprietary know-how and continuing technological and operating innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. Our competitors could gain knowledge of our know-how or trade secrets, either directly or through one or more of our employees or other third parties. If one or more of our competitors can use or independently develop such know-how or trade secrets, our market share, sales volumes and profit margins could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on third parties for transportation services, and their failure to deliver raw material to us or finished products to our customers could increase our costs and harm our reputation and operating results.\nWe rely primarily on third parties for transportation of the products we manufacture, as well as the delivery of EAF dust to our recycling plants and other raw materials, including recycled zinc, to our production facilities. In particular, a substantial portion of the raw materials we use is transported by railroad, which is highly regulated. If any of our third-party transportation providers were to fail to deliver our products in a timely manner, we may be unable to sell those products at full value or at all. Similarly, if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to meet customer demand. In addition, if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us, we may be unable to replace them at reasonable cost. Any failure of a third-party transportation provider to deliver raw materials or finished products in a timely manner could disrupt our operations, harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nWe depend on our supplier relationships, and adverse changes in these relationships or our ability to enter into new relationships could negatively affect our revenue.\nWe rely significantly on our suppliers. Adverse changes in any of our relationships with suppliers or the inability to enter into new relationships with suppliers could negatively impact our operation and performance. Our current arrangements with suppliers may not remain in effect on current or similar terms and the impact of changes to those arrangements may adversely impact our revenue.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the agreements governing our indebtedness.\nAs a result of the issuance of our Convertible Notes, our Senior Secured Notes, our Unsecured Notes, borrowings on our Credit Agreement and borrowings under our credit facility for Horsehead, our credit facility for Zochem and our credit facility for INMETCO, we currently have a significant amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2014, we had $409.1 million of total indebtedness outstanding (excluding $7.9 million of letters of credit outstanding under our ABL Facility and 2014 Zochem Facility) and $11.2 million of surety bonds outstanding). We have an aggregate $5.5 million of available letter of credit and borrowing capacity under our three credit facilities and our Credit Agreement. Our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness could have other important consequences and significant effects on our business.\nFor example, it could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy, or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt, which would reduce the funds available to us for other purposes;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions, in government regulations and in our business by limiting our flexibility in planning for, and making it more difficult for us to react quickly to, changing conditions; and\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including payments on our outstanding series of notes and our credit facilities.\nOur ability to make payments on and refinance our debt depends on our ability to generate cash flow. To some extent, this is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations at levels sufficient to permit us to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, and our cash needs may increase. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt and meet our other cash needs, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell or curtail assets or operations, seek additional capital, or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. If we must sell or curtail our assets or operations, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenue.\nRestrictive covenants in the indentures and credit agreements governing the Convertible Notes, Senior Secured Notes, Unsecured Notes and in the credit agreements governing our four credit facilities limit our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to pursue our business strategies.\nThese indentures and credit agreements contain and the agreements evidencing or governing other future indebtedness may contain, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests.\nThese indentures and credit agreements limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\ndeclare or pay dividends, redeem capital stock or make other distributions to stockholders;\n\u2022\nmake investments and acquire assets;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements that restrict distributions from restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nsell or transfer certain assets;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ncreate liens or use assets as security in other transactions;\n\u2022\nenter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate, or sell, transfer, lease or dispose of substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nmake certain payments on indebtedness.\nOur ability to comply with these covenants will likely be affected by many factors, including events beyond our control, and we may not satisfy those requirements. A breach of the covenants or restrictions under these indentures and credit agreements could result in a default under the applicable indebtedness. Such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In the event the lenders under our credit facilities and holders of our notes accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we cannot assure you that we and our subsidiaries would have sufficient assets to repay such indebtedness.\nThe restrictions contained in these indentures and agreements governing our other indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to:\n\u2022\nfinance our operations;\n\u2022\nmake needed capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nmake strategic acquisitions or investments or enter into alliances;\n\u2022\nwithstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general;\n\u2022\nengage in business activities, including future opportunities, that may be in our interest; and plan for or react to market conditions or otherwise execute our business strategies.\nRisks related to our Common Stock\nThe market price for shares of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations.\nThe market for equity securities has been subject to significant disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of these and other securities, which may or may not have corresponded to the business or financial performance of the particular company. The market price for shares of our common stock has been affected in the past may continue to be affected by general market conditions unrelated to our operating performance.\nSome specific factors that may have a significant effect on the future market price of our shares of common stock include:\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully ramp-up production of SHG zinc at the new zinc facility on the timetable currently contemplated and, once fully operational, our ability to realize the benefits we expect to achieve from that facility;\n\u2022\nactual or expected fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nactual or expected changes in our growth rates or our competitors\u2019 growth rates;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic conditions or conditions in our industry generally;\n\u2022\nchanges in market prices for our products or for our raw materials, including changes in the price of zinc;\n\u2022\nchanges in revenue or earnings estimates, publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in stock market analyst research and recommendations regarding the shares of our common stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community generally or relating to our reputation or our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in conditions in the financial markets;\n\u2022\nour ability to raise additional capital;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our equity or equity-related securities;\n\u2022\nour compliance with environmental laws and regulations and our exposure to liabilities and potential investigations and enforcement actions with respect to such laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nadverse market reaction to any increased indebtedness we incur in the future;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings; and\n\u2022\nactions by our stockholders;\nAs a result of these and other factors, you may be unable to resell your shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid for such shares.\nWe do not have any current plan to pay, and are restricted in our ability to pay, any dividends on our common stock, and as a result, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in our common stock is if the price of our common stock increases.\nWe anticipate that we will retain all future earnings and other cash resources for the future operation and development of our business. Accordingly, we do not intend to declare or pay regular cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. Payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account many factors, including our operating results, financial conditions, current and anticipated cash needs and plans for expansion. The declaration and payment of any dividends on our common stock is also restricted by the terms of our credit facilities and the indenture governing our Senior Secured Notes and Senior Unsecured Notes. As a result, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in us will be if the price of our common stock increases and if you are able to sell your shares at a profit. You may not be able to sell shares of our common stock at a price that exceeds the price that you paid.\nProvisions of our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws could delay or prevent a takeover of us by a third party and may prevent attempts by stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws and of Delaware corporate law may make it difficult and expensive for a third party to pursue a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by our management and board of directors. These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change of control or change our management and board of directors.\nOur Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nprohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow holders of less than a majority of stock to elect some directors;\n\u2022\nrequire super-majority voting by our stockholders to effect amendments to provisions of our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation concerning the number of directors;\n\u2022\nrequire super-majority voting by our stockholders to effect any stockholder-initiated amendment to any provision of our Amended and Restated By-laws;\n\u2022\nlimit who may call special meetings of our stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations of candidates for election to the board of directors or for stockholder proposals that can be acted upon at annual meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nrequire that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly-created directorships to be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder. These provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and limit the return, if any, you are able to achieve on your investment in us.", "PERMNO": 92232, "SIC": 3341, "TIC": "ZINCQ"}
