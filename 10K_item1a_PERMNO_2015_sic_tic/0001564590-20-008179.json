{"cik": "1723128", "company": "Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. In deciding whether to invest in our common stock, you should consider carefully the following risk factors, as well as the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The materialization of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nGlobal economic conditions could harm us.\nWhile global economic conditions have been fairly stable as a whole in recent years, continued concerns about the systemic impact of potential geopolitical issues and economic policy uncertainty, particularly in areas in which we operate, could potentially cause economic and market instability in the future and could adversely affect our business, including our financial performance.\nChallenging economic conditions could result in tighter credit conditions. The cost and availability of credit may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads, which could adversely affect the ability of our third-party distributors, partners, manufacturers and suppliers to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial performance.\nGlobal efforts to contain health care costs continue to exert pressure on product pricing and market access to pharmaceutical products. In many international markets, government-mandated pricing actions have reduced prices of patented drugs. And it is possible that the United States may adopt similar measures to reduce drug prices to consumers. Some countries may be subject to periods of financial instability, may have reduced resources to spend on healthcare or may be subject to economic sanctions, and our business in these countries may be disproportionately affected by these changes. In addition, the currencies of some countries may depreciate against the U.S. dollar substantially and if we are unable to offset the impact of such depreciation, our financial performance within such countries could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop or commercialize new products, our operating results will suffer.\nDeveloping and commercializing a new product is time consuming, costly and subject to numerous factors that may delay or prevent such development and commercialization. Our future results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon our ability to successfully commercialize new products in a timely manner. We face several challenges when developing and commercializing new products, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to develop products in a timely and cost-efficient manner and in compliance with regulatory requirements, including delays associated with the FDA listing and approval process and our ability to obtain required regulatory approvals in a timely manner, or at all, and maintain such approvals if obtained;\n\u2022\nthe success of our clinical testing process to ensure that new products are safe and effective or bioequivalent to the reference listed drug;\n\u2022\nthe risk that any of our products presently under development, if and when fully developed and tested, will not perform as expected;\n\u2022\nthe risk that legal action may be brought against our generic drug products by our branded drug product competitors, including patent infringement claims among others;\n\u2022\nthe availability, on commercially reasonable terms, of raw materials, including APIs and other key ingredients necessary to the development of our drug products; and\n\u2022\nOur ability to scale-up manufacturing methods to successfully manufacture commercial quantities of drug product in compliance with regulatory requirements.\nAs a result of these and other difficulties, our products currently in development may or may not receive necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, which may result in unsuccessful development or commercialization of new products. If any of our products, when acquired or developed and approved, cannot be successfully or timely commercialized, our operating results could be adversely affected. We cannot guarantee that any investment we make in developing or marketing products will be recouped, even if we are successful in commercializing those products.\nIf we fail to obtain exclusive marketing rights for our products or fail to introduce our products on a timely basis, our revenues, gross margin and operating results may decline significantly.\nThe Hatch-Waxman amendments to the FDCA provide for a period of 180 days of generic marketing exclusivity for any applicant that is first to file an ANDA containing a certification of invalidity, non-infringement or unenforceability related to a patent listed with respect to the corresponding branded drug (commonly referred to as a \"Paragraph IV certification\"). \"First filers\" are often able to price the applicable generic drug to yield relatively high gross margins during this 180-day marketing exclusivity period.\nWith respect to our generic products, ANDAs containing Paragraph IV certifications generally become the subject of patent litigation that can be both lengthy and costly. There is no certainty that we will prevail in any such litigation, that we will be the first to file and thus granted the 180-day marketing exclusivity period, or, if we are granted the 180-day marketing exclusivity period, that we will not forfeit such period. Even where we are awarded marketing exclusivity, we may be required to share our exclusivity period with other first filers. In addition, branded drug product companies often authorize a generic version of the corresponding branded drug product to be sold during any period of marketing exclusivity that is awarded (described further below), which reduces gross margins during the marketing exclusivity period. Branded drug product companies may also reduce the price of their branded drug product to compete directly with generic drug products entering the market, which would similarly have the effect of reducing gross margins. Furthermore, timely commencement of the litigation by the patent owner imposes an automatic stay of ANDA approval by the FDA for 30 months, unless the case is decided in the ANDA applicant\u2019s favor during that period. Finally, if the court decision is adverse to the ANDA applicant, the ANDA approval will be delayed until the challenged patent expires, and the applicant forfeits the 180-day marketing exclusivity.\nOur future profitability depends, to a significant extent, upon our ability to introduce, on a timely basis, new generic drug products that are either the first-to-market (or among the first-to-market) or that otherwise can gain significant market share. The timeliness of our product introductions is dependent upon, among other things, the timing of regulatory approval of our products, which to a large extent is outside of our control, as well as the timing of the introduction of competing products. As additional distributors introduce comparable generic pharmaceutical products, price competition intensifies, market access narrows, and product sales prices and gross margins decline, often significantly and rapidly, regardless of whether consumers ultimately pay less for the drug. Accordingly, our revenues and future profitability are dependent, in large part, upon our ability or the ability of our development partners to file ANDAs with the FDA in a timely and effective manner or, alternatively, to enter into contractual relationships with other parties that have obtained marketing exclusivity. No assurances can be given that we will be able to develop and introduce successful products in the future within the time constraints necessary to be successful. If we or our development partners are unable to continue to timely and effectively file ANDAs with the FDA or to partner with other parties that have obtained marketing exclusivity, our revenues, gross margin and operating results may decline significantly, and our prospects and business may be materially adversely affected.\nWith respect to our branded products, generic equivalents for branded pharmaceutical products are typically sold at lower prices than the branded products. The regulatory approval process in the United States and European Union exempts generic products from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy and relies instead on the safety and efficacy of prior products. After the introduction of a competing generic product, a significant percentage of the prescriptions previously written for the branded product are often written for the generic version. In addition, legislation enacted in most U.S. states allows, or in some instances mandates, a pharmacist to dispense an available generic equivalent when filling a prescription for a branded product, in the absence of specific instructions from the prescribing physician. Pursuant to the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act, manufacturers of branded products often bring lawsuits to enforce their patent rights against generic products released prior to the expiration of branded products\u2019 patents, but it is possible for generic manufacturers to offer generic products while such litigation is pending. As a result, branded products typically experience a significant loss in revenues following the introduction of a competing generic product, even if subject to an existing patent. Our branded pharmaceutical products are or may become subject to competition from generic equivalents because there is no proprietary protection for some of the branded pharmaceutical products we sell, because our patent protection expires or because our patent protection is not sufficiently broad or enforceable.\nWe face intense competition in the pharmaceutical industry from both brand and generic drug product companies, which could significantly limit our growth and materially adversely affect our financial results.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. The principal competitive factors in the pharmaceutical market include:\n\u2022\nintroduction of other generic drug manufacturers\u2019 products in direct competition with our generic drug products;\n\u2022\nintroduction of authorized generic drug products in direct competition with our products, particularly during exclusivity periods;\n\u2022\nthe ability of generic drug product competitors to quickly enter the market after the expiration of patents or exclusivity periods, diminishing the amount and duration of significant profits;\n\u2022\nconsolidation among distribution outlets through mergers and acquisitions and the formation of buying groups;\n\u2022\nthe willingness of generic drug customers, including wholesale and retail customers, to switch among products of different pharmaceutical manufacturers;\n\u2022\npricing pressures by competitors and customers, even if similar price savings are not passed on to consumers;\n\u2022\na company\u2019s reputation as a manufacturer and distributor of quality products;\n\u2022\na company\u2019s level of service (including maintaining sufficient inventory levels for timely deliveries);\n\u2022\nproduct appearance and labeling; and\n\u2022\na company\u2019s breadth of product offerings.\nMany of our competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial, R&D, marketing and other resources than we do. Consequently, some of our competitors may be able to develop products and/or processes competitive with, or superior to, our products. Furthermore, we may not be able to (i) differentiate our products from those of our competitors, (ii) successfully develop or introduce new products, on a timely basis or at all, that are less costly than those of our competitors, or (iii) offer customers payment and other commercial terms as favorable as those offered by our competitors. The markets in which we compete and intend to compete are undergoing, and are expected to continue to undergo, rapid and significant change. We expect competition to intensify as technology advances and consolidation continues. New developments by other manufacturers and distributors could render our products uncompetitive or obsolete.\nWe believe our principal competitors in the U.S. generic pharmaceutical products market, where we primarily compete, are Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Mylan N.V., Endo International plc, Sandoz International GmbH, Pfizer Inc., Fresenius Kabi KGAa, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Hikma Pharmaceuticals PLC and Aurobindo Pharma Limited.\nThese companies, among others, collectively compete with the majority of our products. We also face price competition generally as other generic manufacturers enter the market. Any such price competition may be especially pronounced where our competitors source their products from jurisdictions where production costs may be lower (sometimes significantly) than our production costs, especially lower-cost foreign jurisdictions. Any of these factors could result in reductions in our sales prices and gross margin. This price competition has led to an increase in demands for downward price adjustments by generic pharmaceutical distributors. Our principal strategy in addressing our competition is to offer customers a consistent supply of our generic drug products, as well as to pursue product opportunities with the potential for limited competition, such as high-barrier-to-entry first-to-file or first-to-market products. There can be no assurance, however, that this strategy will enable us to compete successfully in the generic drug product industry or that we will be able to develop and implement any new or additional viable strategies.\nCompetition in the generic drug industry has also increased due to the proliferation of authorized generic pharmaceutical products. Authorized generic drug products are generic drug products that are introduced by brand companies, either directly or through third parties, under the brand\u2019s NDA approval for our own branded drug. Authorized generics do not face any regulatory barriers to introduction and are not prohibited from sale during the 180-day marketing exclusivity period granted to the first-to-file ANDA applicant. The sale of authorized generics adversely impacts the market share of a generic drug product that has been granted 180 days of marketing exclusivity. This is a significant source of competition for us, because an authorized generic drug product can materially decrease the profits that we could receive as an otherwise exclusive marketer of a generic drug product. Such actions have the effect of reducing the potential market share and profitability of our generic drug products and may inhibit us from developing and introducing generic pharmaceutical drug products corresponding to certain branded drugs.\nIf we are unable to execute acquisitions or other strategic transactions, or manage our growth therefrom, our business will suffer.\nWe may seek to expand our business through complementary or strategic acquisitions of other businesses, products or assets, or through joint ventures, strategic agreements or other arrangements. Any such acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations may involve significant integration challenges, operational complexities and time consumption and require substantial resources and effort. It may also disrupt our ongoing businesses, which may adversely affect our relationships with customers, employees, regulators and others with whom we have business or other dealings. Further, if we are unable to realize synergies or other benefits expected to result from any acquisitions, joint ventures or other business combinations, or to generate additional revenue to offset any unanticipated inability to realize these expected synergies or benefits, our growth and ability to compete may be impaired, which would require us to focus additional resources on the integration of operations rather than other profitable areas of our business, and may otherwise cause a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Acquisitions may also have hidden costs, including unforeseen pre-acquisition liabilities or the impairment of customer relationships or certain acquired assets such as goodwill. We may also incur costs and inefficiencies to the extent an acquisition expands the industries, markets or geographies in which we operate due to our limited exposure to and experience in a given industry, market or region. Finally, acquisitions can also involve post-transaction disputes with the counterparty regarding a number of matters, including a purchase price or other working capital adjustment or liabilities for which we believe we were indemnified under the relevant transaction agreements.\nAs our competitors introduce their own generic equivalents of our generic drug products, our revenues and gross margin from such products generally decline, often rapidly.\nRevenues and gross margin derived from generic pharmaceutical products often follow a pattern based on regulatory and competitive factors that we believe are unique to the generic pharmaceutical industry. As the patent(s) for a brand name product or the statutory marketing exclusivity period (if any) expires, the first generic manufacturer to receive regulatory approval for a generic equivalent of the product is often able to capture a substantial share of the market. However, as other generic manufacturers receive regulatory approvals for their own generic versions, that market share, and the price of that product, will typically decline depending on several factors, including the number of competitors, the price of the branded product and the pricing strategy of the new competitors. In fiscal 2019, we experienced significant competition with many of our generic products, and as a result, our revenue and gross margin from such products declined significantly. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to continue to develop such products or that the number of our competitors for any given product will not increase to such an extent that we may stop marketing a generic drug product for which we previously obtained approval, which may have a material adverse impact on our revenues and gross margin.\nThe illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of our products or of stolen products could have a negative impact on our reputation and a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThird parties could illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet the rigorous manufacturing and testing standards that our products undergo. Counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective and can be life-threatening. Counterfeit medicines may contain harmful substances, the wrong dose of the active pharmaceutical ingredient or no active pharmaceutical ingredients at all. However, to distributors and users, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version.\nReports of adverse reactions to counterfeit drugs or increased levels of counterfeiting could materially affect patient confidence in the authentic product. It is possible that adverse events caused by unsafe counterfeit products will mistakenly be attributed to the authentic product. In addition, thefts of inventory at warehouses, plants or while in-transit, which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business.\nPublic loss of confidence in the integrity of pharmaceutical products as a result of counterfeiting or theft could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is highly dependent on market perceptions of us and the safety and quality of our products. Our business, products or product pricing could be subject to negative publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMarket perceptions of our business are very important to us, especially market perceptions of the safety and quality of our products. If any of our products or similar products that other companies distribute are subject to market withdrawal or recall or are proven to be, or are claimed to be, harmful to consumers, then this could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Also, because our business is dependent on market perceptions, negative publicity associated with product quality, illness or other adverse effects resulting from, or perceived to be resulting from, our products could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe generic pharmaceutical industry has also in recent years been the subject of significant publicity regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical products more generally, including publicity and pressure resulting from prices charged by competitors and peer companies for new products as well as price increases by competitors and peer companies on older products that the public has deemed excessive. Even if we may have reduced the prices we charge our customers for certain products, often consumers do not see similar reductions in the prices they paid. Any downward pricing pressure on the price of certain of our products arising from social or political pressure to lower the cost of pharmaceutical products could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAccompanying the press and media coverage of pharmaceutical pricing practices and public complaints about the same, there has been increasing U.S. federal and state legislative and enforcement interest with respect to drug pricing. For instance, the DOJ issued subpoenas to pharmaceutical companies, including to the Company, seeking information about the sales, marketing and pricing of certain generic drugs. See Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies for additional information on the DOJ investigation. In addition to the effects of any investigations or claims brought against us, our business, results of operations and financial condition could also be adversely affected if any such inquiries, of us or of other pharmaceutical companies or the industry more generally, were to result in legislative or regulatory proposals that limit our ability to increase the prices of our products.\nA substantial portion of our total revenues is expected to be derived from sales of a limited number of products.\nWe expect that we will continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of a limited number of products. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our significant product families accounted for 32% of our consolidated net revenue. The sale of our products may be significantly influenced by market conditions, as well as regulatory actions. We may experience decreases in the sale of our products in the future as a result of actions taken by our competitors, such as price reductions, or as a result of regulatory actions related to our products or to competing products, which could have a material impact on our results of operations. Actions which could be taken by our competitors, which may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, may include, without limitation, pricing changes and entering or exiting the market for specific products.\nOur growth is dependent on our ability to continue to successfully develop and commercialize new products in a timely manner.\nOur financial results will depend upon our ability to introduce and commercialize additional generic and branded products in a timely manner. In the generic pharmaceutical products market, revenue from newly launched generic products is typically relatively high during the period immediately following launch and can be expected generally to decline over time. Revenue from generic drugs in general, including prices of generic products that have generic alternatives on the market, can generally be expected to decline over time. Revenue from branded pharmaceutical products can be expected to decline as the result of entry of new competitors, particularly of companies producing generic versions of the branded products. Our growth is therefore dependent upon our ability to successfully introduce and commercialize new generic and branded products.\nOur ability to develop or license, or otherwise acquire, and introduce new products on a timely basis in relation to our competitors\u2019 product introductions involves inherent risks and uncertainties.\nProduct development is inherently risky, especially for new drugs for which safety and efficacy have not been established and the market is not yet proven. Likewise, product licensing involves inherent risks including uncertainties due to matters that may affect the achievement of milestones, as well as the possibility of contractual disagreements with regard to terms such as license scope or termination rights. The development and commercialization process, particularly with regard to new drugs, also requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. The process of obtaining FDA approval to manufacture and market new pharmaceutical products is rigorous, time consuming, costly and largely unpredictable. We, or a partner, may not be successful in obtaining FDA approval or in commercializing any of the products that we are developing or licensing.\nOur approved products may not achieve expected levels of market acceptance.\nEven if we are able to obtain regulatory approvals for our new products, the success of those products is dependent upon market acceptance. Levels of market acceptance for our new products could be affected by several factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe availability of alternative products from our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe prices of our products relative to those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe timing of our market entry;\n\u2022\nthe ability to market our products effectively at the retail level;\n\u2022\nthe perception of patients and the healthcare community, including third-party payers, regarding the safety, efficacy and benefits of our drug products compared to those of competing products; and\n\u2022\nthe acceptance of our products by government and private formularies.\nSome of these factors will not be in our control, and our products may not achieve expected levels of market acceptance. Additionally, continuing and increasingly sophisticated studies of the proper utilization, safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products are being conducted by the industry, government agencies and others which can call into question the utilization, safety and efficacy of products currently or previously marketed by us. In some cases, studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of product marketing or other risk management programs such as the need for a patient registry.\nWe may discontinue the manufacture and distribution of certain existing products, which may adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe continually evaluate the performance of our products and may determine that it is in our best interest to discontinue the manufacture and distribution of certain of our products. We cannot guarantee that we have correctly forecasted, or will correctly forecast in the future, the appropriate products to discontinue or that our decision to discontinue various products is prudent if market conditions change. In addition, we cannot assure you that the discontinuance of products will reduce our operating expenses or will not cause us to incur material charges associated with such a decision. Furthermore, the discontinuance of existing products entails various risks, including, in the event that we decide to sell the discontinued product, the risk that we will not be able to find a purchaser for such products or that the purchase price obtained will not be equal to at least the book value of the net assets for such products. Other risks include managing the expectations of, and maintaining good relations with, our customers who previously purchased products from our discontinued products, which could prevent us from selling other products to them in the future. Moreover, we may incur other significant liabilities and costs associated with our discontinuance of products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nManufacturing or quality control problems may damage our reputation for quality production, demand costly remedial activities and negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a pharmaceutical company, we are subject to substantial regulation by various governmental authorities. For instance, we must comply with requirements of the FDA, DEA and other healthcare regulators with respect to the manufacture, labeling, sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, promotion and development of pharmaceutical products. We must register our facilities, whether located in the United States or elsewhere, with the FDA as well as regulators outside the United States, and our products must be made in a manner consistent with cGMP, or similar standards in each territory in which we manufacture. The failure of one of our facilities, or a facility of one of our third-party suppliers, to comply with applicable laws and regulations may lead to breach of representations made to our customers or to regulatory or government action against us related to products made in that facility.\nIn addition, the FDA, DEA and other agencies periodically inspect our manufacturing facilities. Following an inspection, an agency may issue a notice listing conditions that are believed to violate cGMP or other regulations, or a warning letter for violations of \"regulatory significance\" that may result in enforcement action if not promptly and adequately corrected. We remain committed to continuing to improve our quality control and manufacturing practices; however, we cannot be assured that the FDA will continue to be satisfied with our corrective actions and with our quality control and manufacturing systems and standards. Failure to comply strictly with these regulations and requirements may damage our reputation and lead to financial penalties, compliance expenditures, the recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, withdrawal or suspension of the applicable regulator\u2019s review of our submissions, enforcement actions, injunctions and criminal prosecution. Further, other federal agencies, our customers and partners in our alliance, development, collaboration and other partnership agreements with respect to our products and services may take any such FDA observations or warning letters into account when considering the award of contracts or the continuation or extension of such partnership agreements. Because regulatory approval to manufacture a drug is site-specific, the delay and cost of remedial actions, or obtaining approval to manufacture at a different facility, could negatively impact our business. Any failure by us to comply with applicable laws and regulations and/or any actions by the FDA and other agencies as described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings and may be involved in future legal proceedings, all of which are uncertain, and existing and future proceedings may require us to incur substantial expense to defend and/or expose us to substantial liability.\nThe development, manufacture and sale of our drug products involves an inherent risk of product liability and other claims and the associated adverse publicity, and insurance against such potential claims is expensive and may be difficult to obtain. Litigation is inherently subject to uncertainties and we may be required to expend substantial amounts in the defense or resolution of this and similar matters. We regularly monitor the use of our products for trends or increases in reports of adverse events or product complaints, and regularly report such matters to the FDA. In some cases, an increase in adverse event reports may be an indication that there has been a change in a product\u2019s specifications or efficacy. Such changes could lead to a recall of the product in question or, in some cases, increases in product liability claims related to the product in question. If the coverage limits for product liability and other insurance policies are not adequate, or if certain of our products are excluded from coverage, a claim brought against us, whether covered by insurance or not, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We also rely on self-insurance to cover product liability and other claims, and these claims may exceed the amounts we have reserved under our self-insurance program.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may also be subject to a variety of other types of claims, proceedings, investigations and litigation initiated by government agencies or third parties. These matters may include compliance matters, product regulation or safety, taxes, employee benefit plans, employment discrimination, health and safety, environmental, antitrust, securities law, customs, import/export, government contract compliance, financial controls or reporting, intellectual property, allegations of misrepresentation, false claims or false statements, commercial claims, claims regarding promotion of our products and services, or other similar matters. In addition, government investigations related to the use of our generic drug products may cause reputational harm to us. Negative publicity, whether accurate or inaccurate, about the efficacy, safety or side effects of our generic drug products or product categories, whether involving us or a competitor, could materially reduce market acceptance of our products, cause consumers to seek alternatives to our products, result in product withdrawals and cause our stock price to decline. Negative publicity could also result in an increased number of product liability claims, whether or not these claims have a basis in scientific fact. Any such claims, proceedings, investigations or litigation, regardless of the merits, might result in substantial costs to defend or settle, restrictions on product use or sales, or otherwise injure our business.\nWe manufacture and derive a portion of our revenue from the sale of pharmaceutical products in the opioid class of drugs. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has declared the wide spread addiction to and abuse of such products a public health emergency, and in recent months, the federal government has also announced plans to increase federal oversight on opioid sale and consumption. These plans, along with changing public and clinical perceptions of opioid products and the risks relating to their use may result in the imposition of even stricter regulation of such products and further restrictions on their sale and use. For instance, the DEA has recently increased its scrutiny and regulation over the manufacture, distribution and sale of opioid products, which may require us to incur significant expenses to comply with such regulations. State governments have also taken steps to impose surcharges or taxes on opioid manufacturers or distributors. Any new or stricter regulations imposed by governmental authorities such as the DEA related to opioid products, as well as a potential increase in opioid-related litigation involving us, could result in material adverse effects on our business and results of operations. See Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies - Prescription Opioid Litigation for more information regarding opioid-related litigation involving the Company.\nWe are subject to United States federal and state laws related to healthcare fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security, and the failure to comply with such laws may adversely affect our business.\nIn the United States, many of our products are eligible for reimbursement under federal and state health care programs such as Medicaid, Medicare, TriCare, and/or state pharmaceutical assistance programs, and as a result, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are, and will be, applicable to our business. We could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse and patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to: (i) the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, which applies to our marketing and research practices, educational programs, pricing policies and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities, by prohibiting, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, as a means of inducing, or in exchange for, either the referral of an individual or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; (ii) federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent; (iii) the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (\"HIPAA\"), which among other things created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters, and HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and our implementing regulations, which impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information and place restrictions on the use of such information for marketing communications; (iv) the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which among other things, requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under a federal healthcare program to report annually information related to \"payments or other transfers of value\" made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by certain healthcare professionals and their immediate family members, and similar state laws; (v) the government pricing rules applicable to the Medicaid, Medicare Part B, 340B Drug Pricing Program, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs program, the TRICARE program, and state price reporting laws; and (vi) state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above U.S. laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers, and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, such as the requirements under the European Union General Data Protection Regulation which became effective in May 2018, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. Violations of the fraud and abuse laws may result in severe penalties against us and/or our responsible employees, including jail sentences, large fines, and the exclusion of our products from reimbursement under federal and state programs. Defense of litigation claims and government investigations can be costly, time-consuming, and distract management, and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements that would require us to change the way we operate our business. We are committed to conducting the sales and marketing of our products in compliance with the healthcare fraud and abuse laws, but certain applicable laws may impose liability even in the absence of specific intent to defraud. Furthermore, should there be ambiguity, a governmental authority may take a position contrary to a position we have taken, or should an employee violate these laws without our knowledge, a governmental authority may impose civil and/or criminal sanctions.\nAny adverse outcome in these types of actions, or the imposition of penalties or sanctions for failing to comply with fraud and abuse laws, could adversely affect us and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Some of the statutes and regulations that govern our activities, such as federal and state anti-kickback and false claims laws, are broad in scope, and while exemptions and safe harbors protecting certain common activities exist, they are often narrowly drawn. While we manage our business activities to comply with these statutory provisions, due to their breadth, complexity and, in certain cases, uncertainty of application, it is possible that our activities could be subject to challenge by various government agencies. In particular, the FDA, the DOJ and other agencies have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the sales, marketing, research and similar activities of pharmaceutical companies in recent years, and many pharmaceutical companies have been subject to government investigations related to these practices. A determination that we are in violation of these and/or other government regulations and legal requirements may result in civil damages and penalties, criminal fines and prosecution, administrative remedies, the recall of products, the total or partial suspension of manufacturing and/or distribution activities, seizure of products, injunctions, whistleblower lawsuits, failure to obtain approval of pending product applications, withdrawal of existing product approvals, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and other sanctions.\nAny of these types of investigations or enforcement actions could affect our ability to commercially distribute our products and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nApprovals for our new generic drug products may be delayed or become more difficult to obtain if the FDA institutes changes to its approval requirements.\nThe FDA may institute changes to its ANDA approval requirements, such as implementing new or additional fees similar to the fees imposed by the GDUFA and its second iteration (GDUFA II), which may make it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain approval for our new generic products. The FDA may also implement other changes that may directly affect some of our ANDA filings pending approval from the FDA, such as changes to guidance from the FDA regarding bioequivalency requirements for particular drugs. Such changes may cause our development of such generic drugs to be significantly more difficult or result in delays in FDA approval or result in our decision to abandon or terminate certain projects. Any changes in FDA requirements may make it more difficult for us to file ANDAs or obtain approval of our ANDAs and generate revenues and thus have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFederal regulation of arrangements between manufacturers of branded and generic products could adversely affect our business.\nWe are involved in numerous patent litigations in which we challenge the validity or enforceability of innovator companies' listed patents and/or their applicability to our generic pharmaceutical products, as well as patent infringement litigation in which generic companies challenge the validity or enforceability of our patents and/or their applicability to their generic pharmaceutical products, and therefore settling patent litigations has been and is likely to continue to be an important part of our business. As part of the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003, companies, including us, are required to file with the FTC and the DOJ agreements entered into between branded and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the manufacture, marketing and sale of generic versions of branded drugs for their review. The FTC has publicly stated that, in its view, some of the brand-generic settlement agreements violate the antitrust laws and has brought actions against some brand and generic companies that have entered into such agreements. In June 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court in its decision in FTC v. Actavis determined that \"reverse payment\" settlement agreements between brand and generic companies could violate antitrust laws. The Supreme Court held that such settlement agreements are neither immune from antitrust attack nor presumptively illegal but rather should be analyzed under the \"Rule of Reason.\" It is currently uncertain the effect the Supreme Court\u2019s decision will have on our existing settlement agreements or its impact on our ability to enter into such settlement agreements in the future or the terms thereof. The Supreme Court\u2019s decision may result in heightened scrutiny from the FTC of such settlement agreements and we may become subject to increased FTC investigations or enforcement actions arising from such settlement agreements. Further, private plaintiffs, including direct and indirect purchasers of our products, may also become more active in bringing private litigation claims against us and other brand and generic pharmaceutical companies alleging that such settlement agreements violate antitrust laws. Accordingly, we have in the past received and may receive formal or informal requests from the FTC for information about a particular settlement agreement, and there is a risk that the FTC, or others, such as customers, may commence an action against us alleging violations of the antitrust laws. Such settlement agreements may further expose us to claims by purchasers of the products for unlawfully inhibiting competition. We have been involved in private antitrust actions involving certain settlement agreements as described in Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies - Other Litigation Related to the Company's Business.\nAntitrust investigation and claims are generally expensive and time consuming, and we can give no assurance as to the timing or outcome of such investigations or claims or of any future private litigation or government action alleging that one of our settlement agreements violates antitrust laws. The impact of federal regulation of arrangements between manufacturers of brand and generic products, further legislation and the potential for private-party lawsuits associated with such arrangements could adversely affect our business.\nHealthcare reform and a reduction in the coverage and reimbursement levels by governmental authorities, HMOs, MCOs or other third-party payers may adversely affect our business.\nAs part of commercializing our products, we have obtained authorization to receive reimbursement at varying levels for the cost of certain products and related treatments from governmental authorities and private health insurers and other organizations, such as health maintenance organizations (\"HMOs\") and managed care organizations (\"MCOs\"). The trend toward managed healthcare in the United States, the growth of organizations such as HMOs and MCOs, and legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs could significantly influence the purchase of pharmaceutical products, resulting in lower prices and a reduction in product demand. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 were signed into law on March 23, 2010 and March 30, 2010, respectively. These laws are referred to herein as \"healthcare reform.\" A number of provisions of the healthcare reform laws continue to have a negative impact on the price of our products sold to U.S. government entities. For example, the legislation includes measures that (i) significantly increase Medicaid rebates through both the expansion of the program; (ii) substantially expand the Public Health System (340B) program to allow other entities to purchase prescription drugs at substantial discounts; (iii) extend the Medicaid rebate rate to a significant portion of Managed Medicaid enrollees; (iv) apply a 75% discount to Medicare Part D beneficiary spending in the coverage gap for branded and authorized generic prescription drugs; and (v) levy a significant excise tax on the industry to fund healthcare reform. Such cost containment measures and healthcare reform affect our ability to sell our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Benefit established a voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries (primarily the elderly over 65 and the disabled). These beneficiaries may enroll in private drug plans. There are multiple types of Part D plans and numerous plan sponsors, each with its own formulary and product access requirements. The plans have considerable discretion in establishing formularies and tiered co-pay structures and in placing prior authorization and other restrictions on the utilization of specific products. In addition, Part D plan sponsors are permitted and encouraged to negotiate rebates with manufacturers. The Medicare Part D program, which went into effect January 1, 2006, is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\"CMS\") within the Department of Health and Human Services.\nThe CMS has issued extensive regulations and other sub-regulatory guidance documents implementing the Medicare Part D benefit, and the OIG has issued regulations and other guidance in connection with the Medicare Part D program. The federal government can be expected to continue to issue guidance and regulations regarding the obligations of Part D sponsors and their subcontractors. Participating drug plans may establish drug formularies that exclude coverage of specific drugs and payment levels for drugs negotiated with Part D drug plans may be lower than reimbursement levels available through private health plans or other payers. Moreover, beneficiary co-insurance requirements could influence which products are recommended by physicians and selected by patients. There is no guarantee that any drug that we market will be offered by drug plans participating under the Medicare Part D program or of the terms of any such coverage, or that covered drugs will be reimbursed at amounts that reflect current or historical levels. Additionally, any reimbursement granted may not be maintained, or limits on reimbursement available from third-party payers may reduce the demand for, or negatively affect the price of those products, which could significantly harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We may also be subject to lawsuits relating to reimbursement programs that could be costly to defend, divert management\u2019s attention and adversely affect our operating results. Most state Medicaid programs have established preferred drug lists, and the process, criteria and timeframe for obtaining placement on the preferred drug list varies from state to state. Under the Medicaid drug rebate program, a manufacturer must pay a rebate for Medicaid utilization of a product. The rebate for single source products (including authorized generics) is based on the greater of (i) a specified percentage of the product\u2019s average manufacturer price or (ii) the difference between the product\u2019s average manufacturer price and the best price offered by the manufacturer. The rebate for multiple source products is a specified percentage of the product\u2019s average manufacturer price. In addition, many states have established supplemental rebate programs as a condition for including a drug product on a preferred drug list. The profitability of our products may depend on the extent to which they appear on the preferred drug lists of a significant number of state Medicaid programs and the amount of the rebates that must be paid to such states. In addition, there is significant fiscal pressure on the Medicaid program, and amendments to lower the pharmaceutical costs of the program are possible. Such amendments could materially adversely affect our anticipated revenues and results of operations. Due to the uncertainties regarding the outcome of future healthcare reform initiatives and their enactment and implementation, we cannot predict which, if any, of the future reform proposals will be adopted or the effect such adoption may have on our business. Future rulemaking and reform, including repeal of existing law, with respect to the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries, could increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for healthcare products and services, or require additional reporting and disclosure. We cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking, reform or repeal of healthcare laws.\nThe majority of our products are produced at a few locations and a business interruption at one or more of these locations or within our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe produce the majority of the products that we manufacture at our manufacturing facilities in New York, New Jersey and India, as well as at certain third-party suppliers one of which is located in Taiwan. Disruptions at these facilities or within our supply chain can occur for many reasons, including events unrelated to us or beyond our control, such as fires and other industrial accidents, floods and other severe weather events, natural disasters, environmental incidents or other catastrophes, utility and transportation infrastructure disruptions, shortages of raw materials, pandemic diseases or viral contagions such as the recent coronavirus outbreak, and acts of war or terrorism. Work stoppages, whether union-organized or not, can also disrupt operations. Business interruption could also be caused by compliance failures. A significant disruption at any of these facilities or otherwise within our supply chain, even on a short-term basis, could impair our ability to produce and ship products to the market on a timely basis or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nOur profitability depends on our major customers. If these relationships do not continue as expected, our business, condition (financial and otherwise), prospects and results of operations could materially suffer.\nWe currently have over 200 customers, some of which are part of large purchasing groups. Our three largest customers, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Drug Co., accounted for approximately 81%, 83% and 79% of total gross sales of products for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The loss of any one or more of these or any other major customer or the substantial reduction in orders from any one or more of our major customers could have a material impact on our future operating results and financial condition.\nWe may experience declines in the sales volume and prices of our products as a result of the continuing trend of consolidation of certain customer groups, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize any generic or branded pharmaceutical product depends in large part upon the acceptance of the product by third parties, including pharmacies, government formularies, other retailers, physicians and patients. Therefore, our success will depend in large part on market acceptance of our products. We make a significant amount of our sales to a relatively small number of drug wholesalers and retail drug chains. These customers represent an essential part of the distribution chain of our pharmaceutical products. Drug wholesalers and retail drug chains have undergone, and are continuing to undergo, significant consolidation. This consolidation may result in these groups gaining additional purchasing leverage and, consequently, increasing the product pricing pressures facing our business. Additionally, the emergence of large buying groups representing independent retail pharmacies and other drug distributors, and the prevalence and influence of managed care organizations and similar institutions, potentially enable such groups to demand larger price discounts on our products. For example, there has been a recent trend of large wholesalers and retailer customers forming partnerships, such as the alliance between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen Corporation, the alliance between Rite Aid and McKesson Drug Company, and the alliance between CVS Caremark and Cardinal Health. The result of these developments may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nFrom time to time we may need to rely on licenses to proprietary technologies, which may be difficult or expensive to obtain.\nWe may need to obtain licenses to patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties to develop, manufacture and market products. If we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to commercially market our products may be inhibited or prevented, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend to a large extent on third-party suppliers and distributors for the raw materials for our products, particularly the chemical compounds comprising the APIs that we use to manufacture our products, as well as for certain finished goods. A prolonged interruption in the supply of such products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nThe bulk of the raw materials essential to our manufacturing business are purchased from third parties. If we experience supply interruptions or delays, or if a supplier discontinues the sale of certain products, we may have to obtain substitute materials or products, which in turn would require us to obtain amended or additional regulatory approvals, subjecting us to additional expenditures of significant time and resources. In addition, changes in our raw material suppliers could result in significant delays in production, higher raw material costs and loss of sales and customers, because regulatory authorities must generally approve raw material sources for pharmaceutical products, which may be time consuming. For example, we would need as long as 18 months to find and qualify a new sole-source supplier. If we receive less than one year\u2019s termination notice form a sole-source supplier that intends to cease supplying raw materials, it could result in disruption of our ability to produce the drug involved. Any significant supply interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, condition (financial and otherwise), prospects and results of operations. To date, although we have experienced occasional interruptions in supplies, we have experienced no significant difficulties in obtaining raw materials. However, because the federal drug application process requires specification of raw material suppliers, if raw materials from a specified supplier were to become unavailable, FDA approval of a new supplier would be required. The amount of time required for the FDA to qualify a new supplier and confirm that our manufacturing processes meet the necessary standards could cause delays in the manufacturing and marketing of one or more of our products and could, depending on the particular product, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe time necessary to develop generic and branded drugs may adversely affect whether, and the extent to which, we receive a return on our capital.\nWe generally begin our development activities for a new generic drug product several years in advance of the patent expiration date of the brand-name drug equivalent. The development process, including drug formulation, testing, and FDA review and approval, often takes three or more years. This process requires that we expend considerable capital to pursue activities that do not yield an immediate or near-term return. Also, because of the significant time necessary to develop a product, the actual market for a product at the time it is available for sale may be significantly less than the originally projected market for the product. If this were to occur, our potential return on our investment in developing the product, if approved for marketing by the FDA, would be adversely affected and we may never receive a return on our investment in the product. It is also possible for the manufacturer of the brand-name product for which we are developing a generic drug to obtain approvals from the FDA to switch the brand-name drug from the prescription market to the OTC market. If this were to occur, we would be prohibited from marketing our product other than as an OTC drug, in which case revenues could be substantially less than we anticipated.\nDeveloping and commercializing branded pharmaceutical products is generally more costly than developing and commercializing generic products. In order to grow and achieve success in our branded product business, we must continually identify, develop, acquire and license new products that we can ultimately market. There are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and development, and there is a high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including late in the process after substantial investment. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and payer reimbursement, limited scope of approved uses, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Products that do reach the market may ultimately be subject to recalls or other suspensions in sales. Delays and uncertainties in the FDA approval process and the approval processes in other countries can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. Because there is a high rate of failure inherent in the research and development process of new products, there is a significant risk that funds invested in research and development will not generate financial returns. We cannot be certain when or whether any of our products currently under development will be approved or launched or whether, once launched, such products will be commercially successful. We may be required to spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials. The length of time, number of trial sites and patients required for clinical trials vary substantially, and we may have difficulty finding a sufficient number of sites and subjects to participate in our trials. Delays in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, delays in regulatory approvals and delays in product candidates reaching the market. We rely on independent third-party clinical investigators to recruit subjects and conduct clinical trials in accordance with applicable study protocols and laws and regulations. If regulatory authorities determine that we have not complied with regulations in the development of a product candidate, they may refuse to accept trial data from the site and/or not approve the product candidate, and we would not be able to market and sell that product. If we are not able to market and sell our products after significant expenditures to develop and test them, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe testing required for the regulatory approval of our products is conducted primarily by independent third parties. Any failure by any of these third parties to perform this testing properly and in a timely manner may have an adverse effect upon our ability to obtain regulatory approvals.\nOur applications for regulatory approval of our products, including both internally developed and in-licensed products, incorporate the results of testing and other information that is conducted or gathered primarily by independent third parties (including, for example, manufacturers of raw materials, testing laboratories, contract research organizations or independent research facilities). Our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval of the products being tested is dependent upon the quality of the work performed by these third parties, the quality of the third parties\u2019 facilities, and the accuracy of the information provided by third parties. We have little or no control over any of these factors. If this testing is not performed properly, our ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals, and to launch or continue selling products, could be restricted or delayed.\nWe depend on third-party agreements for a portion of our product offerings and any failure to maintain these arrangements or enter into similar arrangements with new partners could result in a material adverse effect.\nWe have broadened our product offering by entering into a variety of third-party agreements covering any combination of joint development, supply, marketing and/or distribution of products. We cannot provide assurance that the development, supply, marketing and/or distribution efforts of our contractual partners will continue to be successful, that we will be able to renew such agreements or that we will be able to enter into new agreements for additional products. Any alteration to, or termination of, our current distribution and marketing agreements, failure to enter into new and similar agreements, or interruption of our product supply under the such agreements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, condition (financial and otherwise), prospects or results of operations.\nWe may make acquisitions of, or investments in, complementary businesses or products, which may be on terms that may not turn out to be commercially advantageous, may require additional debt or equity financing, which could increase our leverage and dilute equity holders.\nWe regularly review the potential acquisition of technologies, products, product rights and complementary businesses and are currently evaluating, and intend to continue to evaluate, potential product and/or company acquisitions and other business development opportunities. We may choose to enter into such transactions at any time. Nonetheless, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates. To the extent that we do identify candidates that we believe to be suitable, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to reach an agreement with the selling party or parties, that the terms we may agree to will be commercially advantageous to us, or that we will be able to successfully consummate such investments or acquisitions even after definitive documents have been signed. If we make any acquisitions or investments, we may finance such acquisitions or investments through our cash reserves, debt financing, which may increase our leverage, or by issuing additional equity interests, which could dilute the holdings of our then-existing owners. If we require financing, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain required financing when needed on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur operations in, and potential expansion into additional, international markets subjects us to increased regulatory oversight both in those international markets and domestically and regulatory, economic, social and political uncertainties, which could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain risks associated with having assets and operations located in foreign jurisdictions, including our operations in India and Ireland. We may also in the future expand our international business and operations into jurisdictions in which we have limited operating experience, including with respect to seeking regulatory approvals, marketing or selling products.\nOur operations in these jurisdictions may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and economic and fiscal policy, including changes in exchange rates and controls, interest rates and taxation policies, increased government regulation, and, with respect to India, any reversal of India\u2019s recent economic liberalization and deregulation policies, as well as social stability and political, economic or diplomatic developments in the future. Certain jurisdictions have, from time to time, experienced instances of civil unrest and hostilities, both internally and with neighboring countries. Rioting, military activity, terrorist attacks, or armed hostilities could cause our operations in such jurisdictions to be adversely affected or suspended. We generally do not have insurance for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist attacks, military conflicts and wars. In addition, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws may conflict with some local customs and practices in foreign jurisdictions. Our international operations may subject us to heightened scrutiny under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), the UK Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws, and could subject us to liability under such laws despite our best efforts to comply with such laws. As a result of our policy to comply with the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws, we may be at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that are not subject to, or do not comply with, such laws. Further, notwithstanding our compliance programs, there can be no assurances that our policies will prevent our employees or agents from violating these laws or protect us from any such violations. Additionally, we cannot predict the nature, scope or impact of any future regulatory requirements that may apply to our international operations or how foreign governments will interpret existing or new laws. Alleged, perceived or actual violations of any such existing or future laws by us or due to the acts of others, may result in criminal or civil sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have increased exposure to tax liabilities, including foreign tax liabilities.\nAs a U.S. company with subsidiaries in, among other countries, India, Germany, Switzerland, Ireland and the U.K., we are subject to, or potentially subject to, income taxes as well as non-income based taxes in these jurisdictions as well as the United States. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate. In addition, we have potential tax exposures resulting from the varying application of statutes, regulations and interpretations, which include exposures on intercompany terms of cross-border arrangements among foreign subsidiaries in relation to various aspects of our business, including research and development activities and manufacturing. Tax authorities in various jurisdictions may disagree with, and subsequently challenge, the amount of profits taxed in such jurisdictions; such challenges may result in increased tax liability, including accrued interest and penalties, which would cause our tax expense to increase and which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations.\nOur Tax Receivable Agreement with APHC Holdings, LLC (formerly known as Amneal Holdings LLC) dated May 4, 2018 (the \"Tax Receivable Agreement\") requires us to make cash payments to them in respect of certain tax benefits to which we may become entitled, and we expect that the payments we will be required to make will be substantial.\nWe are a party to the Tax Receivable Agreement with APHC Holdings, LLC (formerly known as Amneal Holdings LLC), which we refer to as \"Holdings.\" Under the Tax Receivable Agreement, we will be required to make cash payments to Holdings and its permitted transferees equal to 85% of certain tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in certain circumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of redemptions or exchanges of Amneal common units by Holdings and its permitted transferees as set forth in the agreement. We expect that the amount of the cash payments that we will be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be significant. Any payments made by us to Holdings or its permitted transferees under the Tax Receivable Agreement will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us.\nAs discussed in Note 8, Income Taxes, to the notes to our consolidated financial statements, we have determined it is more-likely-than-not we will be unable to utilize all of our deferred tax assets (\u201cDTAs\u201d) subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement and, therefore, reversed the liability under the Tax Receivable Agreement related to the tax savings we may realize from common units sold or exchanged through December 31, 2019. If utilization of these DTAs becomes more-likely- than-not in the future, at such time, we will record liabilities under the Tax Receivable Agreement of up to an additional $195 million as a result of basis adjustments under Internal Revenue Code Section 754, which will be recorded through charges to our consolidated statement of operations. However, if the tax attributes are not utilized in future years, it is reasonably possible no amounts would be paid under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Should we determine that a DTA with a valuation allowance is realizable in a subsequent period, the related valuation allowance will be released and if a resulting Tax Receivable Agreement payment is determined to be probable, a corresponding liability will be recorded. As a result, our future results of operations and earnings could be significantly impacted as results of these matters.\nThe actual amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of redemptions or exchanges by the holders of Amneal common units, the amount of gain recognized by such holders, the amount and timing of the taxable income we generate in the future, and the federal tax rates then applicable.\nIn certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement to Holdings or its permitted transferees may be accelerated or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement provides that upon certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control or if, at any time, we elect an early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement, then our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement to make payments would be based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nAs a result of the foregoing, we could be required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that (i) are greater than the actual benefits we ultimately realize in respect of the tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement and (ii) are based on the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of the Tax Receivable Agreement, which payment may be required to be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits. In these situations, our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to fund or finance our obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nWe will not be reimbursed for any payments made to Holdings or its permitted transferees under the Tax Receivable Agreement in the event that any tax benefits are disallowed.\nPayments under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine, and the Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\") or another tax authority may challenge all or part of the tax benefits we claim, as well as other related tax positions we take, and a court could sustain such challenge. If the outcome of any such challenge would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect a recipient\u2019s rights or obligations (including the amount or timing of payments) under the Tax Receivable Agreement, then we will not be permitted to settle or fail to contest such challenge without the consent of Holdings. We will not be reimbursed for any cash payments previously made to Holdings or its permitted transferees under the Tax Receivable Agreement in the event that any tax benefits initially claimed by us and for which payment has been made to Holdings or its permitted transferees are subsequently challenged by a taxing authority and are ultimately disallowed. Instead, any excess cash payments made by us to Holdings or its permitted transferees will be netted against any future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make to Holdings or its permitted transferees under the terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement. However, we might not determine that we have effectively made an excess cash payment to Holdings or its permitted transferees for a number of years following the initial time of such payment. As a result, payments could be made under the Tax Receivable Agreement in excess of the tax savings that we ultimately realize in respect of the tax attributes with respect to Holdings or its permitted transferees.\nOur competitors or other third parties may allege that we are infringing upon their intellectual property, forcing us to expend substantial resources in litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. Any unfavorable outcome of such litigation, including losses related to \"at-risk\" product launches, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nCompanies that produce branded pharmaceutical products routinely bring litigation against ANDA or similar applicants that seek regulatory approval to manufacture and market generic forms of their branded products alleging patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. Patent holders may also bring patent infringement suits against companies that are currently marketing and selling approved generic products. Litigation often involves significant expense and can delay or prevent introduction or sale of our generic products. If valid and enforceable patents are infringed by our products, we would need to delay selling the infringing generic product unless we could obtain a license from the patent holder, and, if we were already selling the infringing product, cease selling and potentially destroy existing product stock.\nThere may be situations in which we may make business and legal judgments to market and sell products that are subject to claims of alleged patent infringement prior to final resolution of those claims by the courts, based upon our belief that such patents are invalid, unenforceable, or are not infringed by our marketing and sale of such products. This is referred to in the pharmaceutical industry as an \"at-risk\" launch. The risk involved in an at-risk launch can be substantial because, if a patent holder ultimately prevails against us, the remedies available to such holder may include, among other things, damages measured by the profits lost by the patent holder or treble damages, which can be significantly higher than the profits we make from selling the generic version of the product. We could be liable for substantial damages from adverse court decisions in such matters. We may also be harmed by the loss of any value of such inventory that we are unable to market or sell.\nThe use of legal, regulatory and legislative strategies by brand competitors, including authorized generics and citizen\u2019s petitions, as well as the potential impact of proposed legislation, may have an adverse effect on our business.\nBrand drug companies often pursue strategies that may serve to prevent or delay competition from our generic alternatives to their branded products. These strategies include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nmarketing an authorized generic version of a branded product at the same time that we introduce a generic equivalent of that product, directly or through agreement with a generic competitor;\n\u2022\nfiling \"citizen\u2019s petitions\" with the FDA to thwart generic competition by causing delays of our product approvals;\n\u2022\nusing risk evaluation and mitigation strategies (\"REMS\"), related distribution restrictions or other means of limiting access to their branded products, to prevent us from obtaining product samples needed to conduct bioequivalence testing required for ANDA approval, thereby delaying or preventing us from obtaining FDA approval of a generic version of such branded products;\n\u2022\nseeking to secure patent protection of certain \"Elements to Assure Safe Use\" of a REMS program, which are required medical interventions or other actions healthcare professionals need to execute prior to prescribing or dispensing the drug to the patient, in an attempt to thwart our ability to avoid infringement of the patents in question or secure approval;\n\u2022\nseeking to establish regulatory and legal obstacles that would make it more difficult for us to demonstrate a generic product\u2019s bioequivalence or \"sameness\" to the related branded product;\n\u2022\ninitiating legislative and administrative efforts in various states to limit the substitution of generic versions of branded pharmaceutical products for the corresponding branded products;\n\u2022\nfiling suits for patent infringement that automatically delay FDA approval of our generic products;\n\u2022\nintroducing \"next-generation\" products prior to the expiration of market exclusivity for their branded product, which often materially reduces the demand for the generic product for which we may be seeking FDA approval;\n\u2022\nobtaining extensions of market exclusivity by conducting clinical trials of branded drugs in pediatric populations or by other methods as discussed below;\n\u2022\npersuading the FDA to withdraw the approval of branded drugs for which the associated patents are about to expire, thus allowing the brand company to develop and launch new patented products serving as substitutes for the withdrawn products;\n\u2022\nseeking to obtain new patents on drugs for which patent protection is about to expire;\n\u2022\nfiling patent applications that are more complex and costly to challenge;\n\u2022\nseeking temporary restraining orders and injunctions against selling a generic equivalent of their branded product based on alleged misappropriation of trade secrets or breach of confidentiality obligations;\n\u2022\nseeking temporary restraining orders and injunctions against us after we have received final FDA approval for a product for which we are attempting to launch at-risk prior to resolution of related patent litigation;\n\u2022\nreducing the marketing of the branded product to healthcare providers, thereby reducing the branded drug\u2019s commercial exposure and market size, which in turn adversely affects the market potential of the equivalent generic product; and\n\u2022\nconverting branded prescription drugs that are facing potential generic competition to over-the-counter products, thereby significantly impeding the growth of the generic prescription market for such drugs.\nThese and other strategies by brand competitors, as well as the potential impact of proposed legislation, may increase our costs associated with the introduction or marketing of our generic products, delay or prevent such introduction and/or significantly reduce the profit potential of our products.\nWe expend a significant amount of resources on research and development, including milestones on in-licensed products, which may not lead to successful product introductions.\nMuch of our development effort is focused on technically difficult-to-formulate products and/or products that require advanced manufacturing technology. We expend significant resources on research and development primarily to enable us to manufacture and market FDA-approved pharmaceuticals in accordance with FDA regulations. We have entered into, and may in the future enter into, agreements that require us to make significant milestone payments upon achievement of various research and development events and regulatory approvals. As we continue to develop and in-license new products, we will likely incur increased research and licensing expenses. Because of the inherent risk associated with research and development efforts in the industry, particularly with respect to new drugs, our research and development expenditures may not result in the successful introduction of FDA-approved pharmaceutical products. Additionally, after we or our development partners submit an ANDA, the FDA may request that additional studies be conducted. As a result, we may be unable to reasonably determine the total research and development costs required to develop a particular product. Finally, we cannot be certain that any investment made in developing products will be recovered, even if we are successful in commercialization. To the extent that we expend significant resources on research and development efforts and are not ultimately able to successfully introduce new products as a result of those efforts, our business, financial position and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nThe risks and uncertainties inherent in conducting clinical trials could delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our own branded products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWith respect to our branded products which do not qualify for the FDA\u2019s abbreviated application procedures, we must demonstrate through clinical trials that these products are safe and effective for use. We have only limited experience in conducting and supervising clinical trials. The process of completing clinical trials and preparing a NDA may take several years and requires substantial resources. Our studies and filings may not result in FDA approval to market our new drug products and, if the FDA grants approval, we cannot predict the timing of any approval. There are substantial filing fees for NDAs that are not refundable if FDA approval is not obtained.\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with clinical trials. The results of clinical trials may not be indicative of results that would be obtained from large scale testing. Clinical trials are often conducted with patients having advanced stages of disease and, as a result, during the course of treatment these patients can die or suffer adverse medical effects for reasons that may not be related to the pharmaceutical agents being tested, but which nevertheless affect the clinical trial results. In addition, side effects experienced by the patients may cause delay of approval or limit the profile of an approved product. Moreover, our clinical trials may not demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain approval from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may not agree with our assessment of the clinical data or they may interpret it differently. Such regulatory authorities may require additional or expanded clinical trials. Even if the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities approve certain products developed by us, there is no assurance that such regulatory authorities will not subject marketing of such products to certain limits on indicated use.\nFailure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process and, in addition, the results from early clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in later and larger clinical trials, and product candidates in later clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety or efficacy despite having progressed successfully through earlier clinical testing. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including us, have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials, even in advanced clinical trials after showing positive results in earlier clinical trials. The completion of clinical trials for our product candidates may be delayed or halted for the reasons noted above in addition to many other reasons, including:\n\u2022\ndelays in patient enrollment, and variability in the number and types of patients available for clinical trials;\n\u2022\nregulators or institutional review boards may not allow us to commence or continue a clinical trial;\n\u2022\nour inability, or the inability of our partners, to manufacture or obtain from third parties materials sufficient to complete our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndelays or failure in reaching agreement on acceptable clinical trial contracts or clinical trial protocols with prospective clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with trial design, which may result in a failure of the trial to show statistically significant results even if the product candidate is effective;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment commences, resulting in incomplete data;\n\u2022\npoor effectiveness of product candidates during clinical trials;\n\u2022\nsafety issues, including adverse events associated with product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe failure of patients to complete clinical trials due to adverse side effects, dissatisfaction with the product candidate, or other reasons;\n\u2022\ngovernmental or regulatory delays or changes in regulatory requirements, policy and guidelines; and\n\u2022\nvarying interpretation of data by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities.\nIn addition, our product candidates could be subject to competition for clinical study sites and patients from other therapies under development which may delay the enrollment in or initiation of our clinical trials.\nThe FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may require us to conduct unanticipated additional clinical trials, which could result in additional expense and delays in bringing our product candidates to market. Any failure or delay in completing clinical trials for our product candidates would prevent or delay the commercialization of our product candidates. We cannot assure you that our expenses related to clinical trials will lead to the development of brand-name drugs that will generate revenues in the near future. Delays or failure in the development and commercialization of our own branded products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid rebate program and other governmental purchasing and rebate programs are complex and may involve subjective decisions. Any determination that we have failed to comply with those obligations could subject us to penalties and sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe regulations applicable to us regarding reporting and payment obligations with respect to Medicaid reimbursement and rebates and other governmental programs are complex. As described in Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies, we and other pharmaceutical companies are defendants in a number of suits filed by state attorneys general and have been notified of an investigation by the DOJ with respect to Medicaid reimbursement and rebates. Our calculations and methodologies are subject to review and challenge by the applicable governmental agencies, and it is possible that such reviews could adversely affect us and our business. In addition, because our processes for these calculations and the judgments involved in making these calculations involve, and will continue to involve, subjective decisions and complex methodologies, these calculations are subject to the risk of error and misjudgement. Any governmental agencies that have commenced (or that may commence) an investigation of us could impose, based on a claim of violation of anti-fraud and false claims laws or otherwise, civil and/or criminal sanctions, including fines, penalties and possible exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicaid and Medicare). Some of the applicable laws may impose liability even in the absence of specific intent to defraud. Furthermore, should there be ambiguity with respect to how to properly calculate and report payments, and even in the absence of any such ambiguity, a governmental authority may take a position contrary to a position that we have taken and may impose civil and/or criminal sanctions on us. Any such penalties, sanctions, or exclusion from federal health care programs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. From time to time we conduct routine reviews of our government pricing calculations. These reviews may have an impact on government price reporting and rebate calculations used to comply with various government regulations regarding reporting and payment obligations.\nOur operating results are affected by many factors and may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis.\nOur operating results may vary substantially from quarter to quarter and may be greater or less than those achieved in the immediately preceding period or in the comparable period of the prior year. Factors that may cause quarterly results to vary include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe number of new product introductions by us;\n\u2022\nlosses related to inventory write-offs;\n\u2022\nmarketing exclusivity, if any, which may be obtained on certain new products;\n\u2022\nthe level of competition in the marketplace for certain products;\n\u2022\nour ability to create demand in the marketplace for our products;\n\u2022\navailability of raw materials and finished products from suppliers;\n\u2022\nour ability to manufacture products at our manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022\nthe scope and outcome of governmental regulatory actions;\n\u2022\nour dependence on a small number of products for a significant portion of net revenue or income;\n\u2022\nlegal actions against our generic products brought by brand competitors, and legal challenges to our intellectual property rights by generic competitors;\n\u2022\nprice erosion and customer consolidation; and\n\u2022\nsignificant payments (such as milestones) payable by us under collaboration, licensing, and development agreements to our partners before the related product has received FDA approval.\nOur profitability also depends upon the prices we are able to charge for our products, the costs to purchase products from third parties, and our ability to manufacture our products in a cost effective manner. If our revenues decline or do not grow as anticipated, we may not be able to reduce our operating expenses to offset such declines. Failure to achieve anticipated levels of revenues could, therefore, significantly harm our operating results for a particular fiscal period.\nIn certain circumstances, we issue price adjustments and other sales allowances to our customers. Although we may establish reserves based on our estimates of these amounts, if estimates are incorrect and the reserves are inadequate, it may result in adjustments to these reserves that may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nAs described above, the first company to file an ANDA containing a Paragraph IV certification that successfully challenges the patent(s) on a branded product may be granted 180 days of generic market exclusivity by the FDA for such generic product. At the expiration of such exclusivity period, other generic distributors may enter the market, resulting in a significant price decline for the drug (in some instances, price declines have exceeded 90%). When we experience price declines following a period of generic marketing exclusivity, or at any time when a competitor enters the market or offers a lower price with respect to a product we are selling, we may, at our discretion, decide to lower the price of our product to retain market share and provide price adjustments to our customers for the difference between our new (lower) price and the price at which we previously sold the product which is still held in inventory by such customers. The Company accrues for these adjustments when its expected value of an adjustment is greater than zero, based on contractual pricing, actual net sales, accrual rates based on historical average rates, and estimates of the level of inventory of its products in the distribution channel that remain subject to these adjustments. There are also circumstances under which we may decide not to provide price adjustments to certain customers, and consequently, as a matter of business strategy, we may risk a greater level of sale returns of products in a customer\u2019s existing inventory and lose future sales volume to competitors rather than reduce our pricing.\nBased on estimates, we establish reserves for sales allowances including, but not limited to: sales discounts and returns, chargebacks, sales volume rebates, shelf stocks, re-procurement charges, cash discounts, and Medicaid rebate obligations at the time of sale. Although we believe our reserves are adequate as of the date of this report, we cannot provide assurances that our reserves will ultimately prove to be adequate. Increases in sales allowances may exceed our estimates for a variety of reasons, including unanticipated competition or an unexpected change in one or more of our contractual relationships. We will continue to evaluate the effects of competition and will record a price adjustment reserve if and when we deem it necessary. Any failure to establish adequate reserves with respect to sales allowances may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nIf we determine that our goodwill and other intangible assets have become impaired, we may record significant impairment charges, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets. Goodwill is the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. In the future, goodwill and intangible assets may increase as a result of future acquisitions. We review our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment. We review our intangible assets with finite lives for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses, adverse market conditions and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict the activities of an acquired business.\nGeneric pharmaceuticals have faced regular and increasing price erosion each year, placing even greater importance on our ability to continually introduce new products. If these trends continue or worsen, or if we experience further difficulty in this market or the Specialty market, this may continue to adversely affect our revenues and profits in our Generics and Specialty segments. Furthermore, during 2019, the Company's market capitalization decreased significantly. Additional decline in our market capitalization, even if due to macroeconomic or industry-wide factors, could put pressure on the carrying value of our goodwill in both our Generics and Specialty segments and cause the Company to conduct an interim impairment test. A determination that all or a portion of our goodwill or other intangible assets is impaired, although a non-cash charge against earnings, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nInvestigations and litigation concerning the calculation of average wholesale prices may adversely affect our business.\nMany government and third-party payers, including Medicare, Medicaid, HMOs and others, reimburse doctors and others for the purchase of certain prescription drugs based on a drug\u2019s average wholesale price (\"AWP\"). In the past several years, state and federal government agencies have conducted ongoing investigations of manufacturers\u2019 reporting practices with respect to AWP, as a result of which certain agencies have suggested that reporting of inflated AWPs by manufacturers has led to excessive payments for prescription drugs. Numerous pharmaceutical companies have been named as defendants in actions brought by various State Attorneys General and have faced state law qui tam actions brought on behalf of various states, alleging generally that the defendants defrauded state Medicaid systems by purportedly reporting or causing the reporting of AWP and/or \"Wholesale Acquisition Costs\" that exceeded the actual selling price of the defendants\u2019 prescription drugs. We, for example, are subject to a civil investigative demand issued by the Texas State Attorney General alleging certain overpayments to us by the Texas Medicaid system as further described in Note 20. Commitments and Contingencies - Texas State Attorney General Civil Investigative Demand . These cases generally seek some combination of actual damages, and/or double damages, treble damages, compensatory damages, statutory damages, civil penalties, disgorgement of excessive profits, restitution, disbursements, counsel fees and costs, litigation expenses, investigative costs, injunctive relief, punitive damages, imposition of a constructive trust, accounting of profits or gains derived through the alleged conduct, expert fees, interest and other relief that the court may have deemed proper.\nWe can give no assurance that we will be able to settle current or future actions on terms that we deem reasonable, or that such settlements or adverse judgments, if entered, will not exceed the amount of any reserve. Accordingly, such actions could adversely affect us and may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology, and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including cybersecurity and data leakage risks.\nSignificant disruptions to our information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information, and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such information. Additionally, our information technology systems are critical to our ability to store electronic and financial information and to manage a variety of business processes and activities, including manufacturing, financial, logistics, sales, marketing and administrative functions. We depend on our information technology infrastructure to communicate internally and externally with employees, customers, suppliers and others. We have been the victim of phishing attempts, some of which have been successful. We also use information technology networks and systems to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. We have outsourced significant elements of our information technology infrastructure; as a result we manage independent vendor relationships with third-parties who are responsible for maintaining significant elements of our information technology systems and infrastructure and who may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology systems, and those of our third party vendors, make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions and security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, partners or vendors. These systems are also vulnerable to attacks by malicious third parties, and may be susceptible to intentional or accidental physical damage to the infrastructure maintained by us or by third parties. Maintaining the secrecy of confidential, proprietary, and/or trade secret information is important to our competitive business position. We continually assess these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities, as well as ensure our third-party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this risk. But there can be no guarantee that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security breaches in our systems or the unauthorized or inadvertent wrongful use or disclosure of confidential information that could adversely affect our business operations or result in the loss, dissemination, or misuse of critical or sensitive information. A breach of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination, misappropriation or misuse of trade secrets, proprietary information, or other confidential information, whether as a result of theft, hacking, fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, or for any other cause, could enable others to produce competing products, use our proprietary technology or information, and/or adversely affect our business position. Further, any such interruption, security breach, loss or disclosure of confidential information could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flow.\nOur future success depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees and consultants.\nOur future success depends, to a substantial degree, upon the continued service of the members of our management team. The loss of the services of members of our management team, or their inability to perform services on our behalf, could have a material adverse effect on our business, condition (financial and otherwise), prospects and results of operations. On August 5, 2019, we announced significant changes to our executive officers and board of directors, including the appointments of Chirag Patel and Chintu Patel as Co-Chief Executive Officers. Each of Chirag Patel and Chintu Patel is a member of the Amneal Group. Any change in senior management involves significant inherent risk, and any failure to effect a smooth transition process could hinder our strategic planning, execution and future performance. While we endeavor to minimize any negative impact associated with changes such as these, there may be uncertainty among investors, employees and others regarding our future direction and performance. Any disruption in our operations, uncertainty regarding our future or negative public perception regarding the change could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur success also depends, to a large extent, upon the contributions of our sales, marketing, scientific and quality assurance staff. We compete with brand and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers for qualified personnel, and our competitors may offer more favorable employment opportunities than we do. If we are not able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives we could experience constraints that would adversely affect our ability to sell and market our products effectively, to meet the demands of our strategic partners in a timely fashion, and to support our research and development programs. In particular, our sales and marketing efforts depend on the ability to attract and retain skilled and experienced sales, marketing and quality assurance representatives. Although we believe that we have been successful in attracting and retaining skilled personnel in all areas of our business, we cannot provide assurance that we can continue to attract, train and retain such personnel. Any failure in this regard could limit the rates at which we generate sales and develop or acquire new products.\nWe depend on our ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights.\nOur success depends on our ability to protect and defend the intellectual property rights associated with our current and future products. If we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately, competitors may manufacture and market products similar to, or that may be confused with, our products, and our generic competitors may obtain regulatory approval to make and distribute generic versions of our branded products. Some patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy or are not published until the resulting patents issue. We also cannot be certain that patents will be issued with respect to any of our patent applications or that any existing or future patents issued to or licensed by us will provide competitive advantages for our products or will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or held unenforceable in proceedings commenced by our competitors or other third parties. Furthermore, our patent rights may not prevent or limit our present and future competitors from developing, making, importing, using or commercializing products that are functionally similar to our products. We rely particularly on trade secrets, trademarks, unpatented proprietary expertise and continuing innovation that we seek to protect, in part, by registering and using marks; and by entering into confidentiality agreements with licensees, suppliers, employees, consultants and other parties-we use this approach to protecting our intellectual property in large part because few of our products are protected by patents. We cannot provide assurance that these agreements will not be breached or circumvented. We also cannot be certain that we will have recourse to adequate remedies in the event of a breach of such agreements. Disputes may arise concerning the ownership of intellectual property or the applicability of confidentiality agreements. We cannot be sure that our trade secrets and proprietary technology will not be independently developed or otherwise become known by our competitors or, if patents are not issued with respect to our internally developed products, that we will be able to maintain the confidentiality of information relating to these products. In addition, efforts to ensure our intellectual property rights may be costly, time-consuming and/or ultimately unsuccessful. We cannot be sure that we will have the resources to protect our own rights against infringement by third parties. Our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, timely file our periodic reports, maintain our reporting status or prevent fraud.\nWe are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to conduct an annual review and evaluation of their internal controls and attestations of the effectiveness of internal controls by independent auditors. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. Our failure to maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls in accordance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act or the inability of our independent registered public accounting firm to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. In addition, if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nOur management or our independent registered public accounting firm may also identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. The existence of internal control material weaknesses may result in current and potential stockholders and alliance and collaboration agreements\u2019 partners losing confidence in our financial reporting, which could harm our business, the market price of our common stock, and our ability to retain our current, or obtain new, alliance and collaboration agreements\u2019 partners.\nIn addition, the existence of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may affect our ability to timely file periodic reports under the Exchange Act. The inability to timely file periodic reports under the Exchange Act could result in the SEC revoking the registration of our common stock, which would prohibit us from listing or having our stock quoted on any public market. This would have an adverse effect on our business and stock price by limiting the publicly available information regarding us and greatly reducing the ability of our stockholders to sell or trade our common stock.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union may adversely affect our business.\nIn June 2016, a majority of British voters voted to exit the European Union in a referendum vote commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d in March 2017, the British government delivered formal notice of the U.K.\u2019s intention to leave the European Union and on January 31, 2020, the U.K. left the European Union. The British government is currently negotiating the terms of the U.K.\u2019s exit with the European Union. The withdrawal could, among other things, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the U.K. and the European Union, undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt trade between the U.K. and the European Union or other nations. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate. The effects of Brexit will depend on the agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to European Union or other markets during the transitional period or more permanently. It is unclear what general long-term economic, financial, trade and legal implications the U.K. withdrawal from the European Union will have and how the withdrawal and implications thereof will impact our business. In addition, Brexit may lead other European Union member countries to consider referendums regarding their European Union membership. Any of these events, along with any political, economic and regulatory changes that may occur, could cause political and economic uncertainty in Europe and internationally and harm our business and financial results.\nWe may need to raise additional funds in the future which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nWe may consider issuing additional debt or equity securities in the future to fund potential acquisitions or investments, to refinance existing debt, or for general corporate purposes. If we issue equity, convertible preferred equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds, our stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our stockholders. If we incur additional debt, we may increase our leverage relative to our earnings or to our equity capitalization, requiring us to pay additional interest expenses and potentially lowering our credit ratings. We may not be able to market such issuances on favorable terms, or at all, in which case, we may not be able to develop or enhance our products, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer requirements.\nIf we determine in the future that we will not be able to fully utilize all or part of our deferred tax assets, we would record a valuation allowance through earnings in the period the determination was made, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and earnings.\nWe record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets (\u201cDTAs\u201d) when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a DTA will not be realized. We routinely evaluate the realizability of our DTAs by assessing the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered based on all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, estimates of future taxable income, tax planning strategies and results of operations. Estimating future taxable income is inherently uncertain and requires judgment. In projecting future taxable income, we consider our historical results and incorporate certain assumptions, including projected new product launches, revenue growth, and operating margins, among others.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we considered all available objective and verifiable evidence both positive and negative, including historical levels of pre-tax income (loss) both on a consolidated basis and tax reporting entity basis, legislative developments, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future pre-tax income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. We estimated that as of December 31, 2019 we will have generated a cumulative consolidated three-year pre-tax loss. As a result of this analysis, we considered it more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of our gross DTAs and therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance of $470 million as of December 31, 2019 to reduce the carrying value of these gross DTAs, net of the impact of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, to zero.\nFailure to comply with our government contracting regulations could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn January 2020, we completed the acquisition of AvKARE and R&S Northeast. For further details, see Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures. AvKARE generates a substantial amount of its net revenue from government contracts. Contracts with federal, state, and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations, contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and performance, and are subject to regular audits and investigations. Any failure by us to comply with the government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from future government business. Such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business. In addition, some of AvKARE\u2019s contracts provide for termination by the government, without cause. If one or more of our government contracts is suspended or terminated or if we are suspended, disbarred or otherwise restricted from future government work, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial health.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness. In order to finance the Combination, during the combined year ended December 31, 2018, we borrowed $2.7 billion in an aggregate principal amount of new senior secured term loans and entered into a new senior secured asset based revolving credit facility with borrowing capacity of up to $478 million, under which no amounts were drawn and outstanding as of December 31, 2019. The net proceeds from the new term loans were used to finance in part the Combination, to pay off certain existing indebtedness of Amneal and Impax and to pay fees and expenses related to the foregoing. For additional details of our debt, see Note 17. Debt.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, raw materials, strategic acquisitions and other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nexpose us to interest rate fluctuations because the interest on certain debt under the credit facilities is imposed at variable rates;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for operations and other purposes;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our lenders, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to refinance indebtedness or increase the associated costs;\n\u2022\nrequire us to sell assets to reduce debt or influence the decision about whether to do so;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate or prevent us from carrying out capital spending that is necessary or important to our growth strategy and efforts to improve operating margins or our business; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any competitors that have less debt or comparable debt at more favorable interest rates and that, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand economic downturn.\nOur indebtedness and the required payments on our indebtedness or other agreements may be impacted by expected reforms related to LIBOR. For example, the variable interest rates payable under our credit facility are linked to LIBOR as the benchmark for calculating the applicable rates. Recent regulatory guidance and reform proposals regarding LIBOR are expected to ultimately to lead to the discontinuation of LIBOR or to cause LIBOR to become unavailable as a benchmark rate. Although the terms of our credit facilities provide for an alternate rate of interest to be established should the use of LIBOR be discontinued, no assurance can be made that any such alternate rate will perform in a manner similar to LIBOR and may result in interest rates that are higher or lower than those that would have resulted had LIBOR remained in effect.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors which may be beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $2.6 billion of indebtedness, with an annual interest expense of approximately $140 million and annual debt payments of approximately $27 million on our Term Loan.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our credit agreements restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations when due.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations, including our indebtedness.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and, as a result:\n\u2022\nour debt holders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable;\n\u2022\nthe lenders under our credit agreements could terminate their commitments to lend us money; and\n\u2022\nwe could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nThe terms of our credit agreements restrict our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.\nOur credit agreements contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on the ability to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nincur liens;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nalter the businesses conducted by us;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.\nA breach of the covenants under such credit agreements could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial results. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and payable under our credit agreements, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In the event our lenders accelerated the repayment of the borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. Any acceleration of amounts due under the credit agreements would likely have a material adverse effect on us. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:\n\u2022\nlimited in how we conduct business;\n\u2022\nunable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns; or\n\u2022\nunable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nThese restrictions may affect our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nWe are a holding company with nominal net worth and depend on dividends and distributions from our subsidiaries.\nWe are a holding company with nominal net worth and will not have any material assets or conduct any business operations other than our investments in our subsidiaries. Our business operations are conducted primarily out of our direct operating subsidiary, Amneal, and its subsidiaries. As a result, our ability to satisfy our financial obligations and, notwithstanding any restrictions on payment of dividends under our existing indebtedness, our ability to pay dividends, if any, is dependent upon cash dividends and distributions or other transfers from our subsidiaries, including from Amneal.\nThe Class A Common Stock price is expected to fluctuate significantly, and the market price of Class A Common Stock may decline.\nThe market price of our Class A Common Stock has been and could continue to be subject to significant fluctuations. Market prices for securities of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and other life sciences companies have historically been particularly volatile. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of Class A Common Stock to fluctuate include:\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain regulatory approvals for product candidates, and delays or failures to obtain such approvals;\n\u2022\nthe failure of any of our product candidates, if approved for marketing and commercialization, to achieve commercial success;\n\u2022\nissues in manufacturing our approved products or product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe entry into, or termination of, key agreements, including key licensing or collaboration agreements;\n\u2022\nthe initiation of material developments in, or conclusion of, litigation to enforce or defend any of our intellectual property rights or defend against the intellectual property rights of others;\n\u2022\nannouncements by commercial partners or competitors of new commercial products, clinical progress (or the lack thereof), significant contracts, commercial relationships, or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nadverse publicity relating to our markets, including with respect to other products and potential products in such markets;\n\u2022\nthe introduction of technological innovations or new therapies competing with our products or our potential products;\n\u2022\nthe loss of talented employees;\n\u2022\nchanges in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if any, who cover the Class A Common Stock regarding us, our business, our industry or our competitors, or the failure of analysts to regularly publish reports on us;\n\u2022\ngeneral and industry-specific economic conditions potentially affecting our research and development expenditures;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of health care payment systems;\n\u2022\nperiod-to-period fluctuations in our financial results;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed financial and development projections we may provide to the public;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet or exceed the financial and development projections of the investment community;\n\u2022\nthe perception of the pharmaceutical industry by the public, legislators, regulators, and the investment community;\n\u2022\nadverse regulatory decisions;\n\u2022\ndisputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters, and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022\nsales of the Class A Common Stock by us or our stockholders in the future; and\n\u2022\ntrading volume of the Class A Common Stock.\nMoreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies or the biotechnology sector. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of our Class A Common Stock.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could significantly harm the Company\u2019s profitability and reputation.\nFuture sales of shares by stockholders could cause the Class A Common Stock price to decline.\nIf our stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of Class A Common Stock in the public market, the trading price of Class A Common Stock could decline.\n165,022,754 shares of Common Stock are held by the Amneal Group and are eligible for sale or transfer (subject to certain continuing restrictions). The Amneal Group and the other stockholders may sell their shares in the public market. Such shares may also be resold into the public markets pursuant to the resale registration statement which the SEC has declared effective or in accordance with the requirements of Rule 144, including the volume limitations, manner of sale requirements and notice requirements thereof. If some or all of these shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the trading price of the Class A Common Stock could decline.\nThe high concentration of ownership of the Company\u2019s Common Stock may prevent other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest that could cause the Class A Common Stock\u2019s stock price to decline.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our executive officers and directors, and affiliates of our executive officers and directors, beneficially owned or controlled approximately 55% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, these executive officers, directors, and their affiliates, acting as a group, have substantial influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or any other significant corporate transactions. These stockholders may also delay or prevent a change of control of the Company, even if such a change of control would benefit our other stockholders. The significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of Class A Common Stock due to investors\u2019 perception that conflicts of interest may exist or arise.\nWe are controlled by the Amneal Group. The interests of the Amneal Group may differ from the interests of our other stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Amneal Group controlled approximately 55% of the voting power of all of our outstanding shares of common stock.\nThrough its control of a majority of our voting power and the provisions set forth in our charter, bylaws and the Company\u2019s Second Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement, dated December 16, 2017 (as amended to date, the \u201cStockholders Agreement\u201d), the Amneal Group has the ability to designate and elect a majority of our board of directors. As of December 31, 2019, six out of eleven members of our board of directors, have been designated by the Amneal Group. The Amneal Group has control over all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including changes in capital structure, transactions requiring stockholder approval under Delaware law and corporate governance, subject to the terms of the Stockholders Agreement relating to the Amneal Group's agreement to vote in favor of directors not designated by the Amneal Group and such other matters that are set forth in the Stockholders Agreement. The Amneal Group may have different interests than our other stockholders and may make decisions adverse such interests.\nAmong other things, the Amneal Group's control could delay, defer, or prevent a sale of the Company that the Company\u2019s other stockholders support, or, conversely, this control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could discourage a potential investor from seeking to acquire Class A Common Stock and, as a result, might harm the market price of that Class A Common Stock.\nThe Amneal Group could transfer control of us to a third party by transferring its shares. In addition, the Company believes members of the Amneal Group have pledged Amneal Common Units and the corresponding shares of Class B Common Stock to secure borrowings, and other members of the Amneal Group could enter into similar arrangements. In connection with these arrangements, the Company has entered into agreements with certain Amneal Group members and the lending institutions to whom their securities may be pledged. Because of the recent drop in our stock price, the value of pledged Amneal securities has decreased, which could increase the likelihood of a margin call on a pledge of Amneal securities. The voluntary or forced sale of some or all of these units or shares pursuant to a margin call or otherwise could cause our stock price to decline and negatively impact our business. Similarly, a voluntary or forced sale could cause the Company to lose its \u201ccontrolled company\u201d status under the New York Stock Exchange listing requirements, which would require us to comply over a transition period with certain corporate governance requirements from which we are currently exempt, including having a fully independent compensation committee. If all of the Amneal Common Units and corresponding shares of Class B stock were pledged to secure borrowings, a complete foreclosure could result in a change of control.\nOur charter provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit the ability of our stockholders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our current or former directors, officers or employees.\nOur charter provides that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court does not have jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware or the federal district court for the District of Delaware) will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company, any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former director or officer to us or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our charter or bylaws or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our current or former directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our current or former directors, officers and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our charter to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAnti-takeover provisions under Delaware law could make an acquisition of the Company more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management.\nBecause we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits stockholders owning in excess of 15% of the outstanding voting stock of the Company from merging or combining with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively will provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove then current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of management.\nWe do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe current expectation is that we will retain our future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our Class A Common Stock will be the sole source of gain for our stockholders for the foreseeable future. The payment of future cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will be dependent upon our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements and other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant.", "PERMNO": 82702, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "AMRX"}
