{"cik": "1299139", "company": "TearLab Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Condition\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future. Such capital, may not be available to us on reasonable terms, if at all, when or as we require additional funding. If we issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that may be convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for our common stock, our existing stockholders would experience further dilution.\nBased on a revised operating model that we implemented in December 2017, we expect that we will need to raise additional capital prior to the end of the first quarter of 2020. This estimate is subject to risk based primarily on our continued success in implementing the revised operating model, maintaining certain revenue levels despite a reduction in our commercial resources that was made in order to reduce our cash burn and accurately forecasting the remaining development expenses required to gain FDA clearance of our next generation diagnostic platform. Any financings undertaken to raise needed capital may involve the issuance of debt, equity and/or securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for our equity securities. These financings may not be available to us on reasonable terms or at all when and as we require funding. Any failure to obtain additional working capital when required would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, our ability to continue as a going concern and would be expected to result in a decline in our stock price. If we consummate such financings, the terms of such financings may adversely affect the interests of our existing stockholders. Any issuances of our common stock, preferred stock, or securities such as warrants or notes that are convertible into, exercisable or exchangeable for our capital stock, would have a dilutive effect on the voting and economic interest of our existing stockholders. If access to sufficient capital is not available as and when needed, our business will be materially impaired and we may be required to cease operations, curtail product development, manufacturing improvements, or sales generation programs, attempt to obtain funds through licensing certain technologies or products, or we may be required to significantly reduce expense, sell assets, seek a merger or joint venture partner, file for protection from creditors, liquidate all our assets or cease operations and wind down our business.\nWe have limited working capital and a history of losses that raise substantial doubts as to whether we will be able to continue as a going concern.\nWe have prepared our consolidated financial statements on the basis that we would continue as a going concern. However, we have incurred losses in each year since our inception and there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We do not currently have any available borrowing under our term loan or credit facility. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary if we were not able to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to generate positive cash flows from operations, we would need to undertake a review of potential business alternatives, which may include, but are not limited to, a merger or sale of the company or ceasing operations and winding down the business.\nWe have incurred losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe have incurred losses in each year since our inception. As of December 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $531 million. Our losses have resulted primarily from expenses incurred in research and development of our product candidates from the former retina and glaucoma business divisions. We do not know when or if we will successfully commercialize the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System in the United States or in international markets or receive approval to commercialize our next generation TearLab Discovery TM System on a scale that will allow us to achieve and sustain profitability. As a result, and because of the numerous risks and uncertainties facing us, it is difficult to provide the extent of any future losses or the time required to achieve profitability, if at all. Any failure to become and remain profitable would require us to undertake a review of the potential business alternatives discussed above.\n- 9 -\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, which currently consists of our credit facility with CRG. We may not be able to satisfy our minimum revenue and cash covenants, as required by the CRG term loan. If our annual sales revenue levels do not meet or exceed the levels required by the CRG covenants, we will be required to raise additional equity or subordinated debt, with the proceeds paid to reduce the outstanding principal of the CRG term loan. This financing could dilute existing shareholders and impact the value of their investment.\nOn March 4, 2015, we executed a term loan agreement with CRG as lenders which we refer to as the Term Loan Agreement, providing us with access of up to $35.0 million under the Term Loan Agreement. We entered into an amendment of the Term Loan Agreement with CRG on August 6, 2015. We received $25.0 million in gross proceeds during 2015. We were unable to access a third tranche of $10.0 million because we did not achieve at least $38.0 million in twelve-month sales revenue prior to June 30, 2016, as required to access the third tranche.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our debt obligations depends on numerous factors, including the amount of our cash reserves and our actual and projected financial and operating performance. These amounts and our performance are subject to certain financial and business factors, as well as prevailing economic and competitive conditions, some of which may be beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash reserves or cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, facility fee, and interest on our existing or future indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets or operations, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we would be able to take any of these actions, or that these actions would permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In addition, in the event of our breach of the Term Loan Agreement, we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts earlier than anticipated, and the lenders may foreclose on their security interest in our assets.\nThe CRG loan is collateralized by all our assets. Additionally, the Term Loan Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants that we agreed to. Among them are requirements that we must attain minimum annual revenue and minimum cash threshold levels. The minimum annual revenue threshold levels required by the Term Loan Agreement are $24.0 million, $38.0 million and $45.0 million for calendar years 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The minimum cash balance required is $3.0 million, subject to certain conditions.\nIf we do not have annual revenue greater or equal to the annual revenue covenant in a calendar year, we will have to raise subordinated debt or equity, which we refer to as the CRG Equity Cure, equal to twice the difference between the annual revenue and the revenue covenant, with the total proceeds from this financing to be used to reduce the principal of the Term Loan Agreement. We cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve the annual revenue thresholds and the minimum cash threshold. We cannot assure you that we would be able to raise the financing for the CRG Equity Cure, if required. In addition, in the event of our breach of the Term Loan Agreement, we may be required to repay any outstanding amounts earlier than anticipated, and the lenders may foreclose on their security interest in our assets.\nBorrowings under the Term Loan Agreement are subject to certain conditions, including the non-occurrence of a material adverse change in our business or operations (financial or otherwise), or a material impairment of the prospect of repayment of obligations.\n- 10 -\nOur existing Term Loan Agreement contains restrictive and financial covenants that may limit our operating flexibility.\nThe Term Loan Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens, merge with other companies or consummate certain changes of control, acquire other companies, engage in new lines of business, make certain investments, pay dividends, transfer or dispose of assets, amend certain material agreements or enter into various specified transactions. We therefore may not be able to engage in any of the foregoing transactions unless we obtain the consent of CRG or terminate the Term Loan Agreement. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow or sales to meet the financial covenants or pay the principal and interest under the agreement. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that future working capital, borrowings or equity financing will be available to repay or refinance the amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement.\nOur financial results may vary significantly from year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter due to a number of factors, which may lead to volatility in the trading price of our common stock.\nOur annual and quarterly revenue and results of operations have varied in the past and may continue to vary significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter. The variability in our annual and quarterly results of operations may lead to volatility in our stock price as research analysts and investors respond to these fluctuations. These fluctuations are due to numerous factors that are difficult to forecast, including:\n\u25cf fluctuations in demand for our products;\n\u25cf changes in customer budget cycles and capital spending;\n\u25cf seasonal variations in customer operations that could occur during holiday or summer vacation periods;\n\u25cf tendencies among some customers to defer purchase decisions to the end of the quarter or fiscal year;\n\u25cf the unit value of our systems;\n\u25cf changes in our pricing and sales policies or the pricing and sales policies of our competitors;\n\u25cf changes in reimbursement levels that might negatively impact our pricing policies;\n\u25cf our ability to design, manufacture and deliver products to our customers in a timely and cost effective manner;\n\u25cf quality control or yield problems in our manufacturing suppliers;\n\u25cf our ability to timely obtain adequate quantities of the components used in our products;\n\u25cf new product introductions and enhancements by us and our competitors;\n\u25cf unanticipated increases in costs or expenses;\n\u25cf our complex, variable and, at times, lengthy sales cycle;\n\u25cf global economic conditions; and\n\u25cf fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe foregoing factors, as well as other factors, could materially and adversely affect our quarterly and annual results of operations. In addition, a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed due to our manufacturing, research and development, and sales and general administrative efforts. Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations. We expect that our sales will continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis and our financial results for some periods may differ from those projected by securities analysts, which could significantly decrease the price of our common stock.\n- 11 -\nRisks Related to our Business\nOur near-term success is highly dependent on the success of the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System, and we cannot be certain that it will be successfully commercialized in the United States.\nThe TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System is currently our only commercialized product. Our product is currently sold outside of the United States pursuant to CE mark approval; in Canada pursuant to a Health Canada Medical Device License; and in the United States as a result of having received 510(k) approval from the FDA to market the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System to those reference and physician operated laboratories with CLIA waiver certifications. Even though the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System has received all regulatory approvals in the United States, it may never generate sufficient sales to achieve profitability. If the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System is not as successfully commercialized as expected, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become profitable or continue our operations. Any failure of the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System to be successfully commercialized in the United States would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows and could result in a substantial decline in the price of our common stock.\nOur near-term success is highly dependent on increasing sales of the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System outside the United States, and we cannot be certain that we will successfully increase such sales.\nOur product is currently sold outside of the United States pursuant to CE mark approval and Health Canada Approval in Canada. Our near-term success is highly dependent on increasing our international sales. We may also be required to register our product with health departments in our foreign market countries. A failure to successfully register in such markets would negatively affect our sales in any such markets. In addition, import taxes are levied on our product in certain foreign markets. Other countries may adopt taxation codes on imported products. Increases in such taxes or other restrictions on our product could negatively affect our ability to import, distribute and price our product.\nWe have outstanding liabilities, which could adversely affect our ability to adjust our business to respond to competitive pressures and to obtain sufficient funds to satisfy our future research and development needs, and to defend our intellectual property.\nAs of December 31, 2018, our total liabilities were $35.2 million including $32 million of long-term obligations under our Term Loan Agreement. Our significant liability service requirements could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities. For example:\n\u25cf our liabilities increase our vulnerability to economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions and could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that are less leveraged;\n\u25cf our liabilities could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry and could limit our ability to pursue other business opportunities, borrow money for operations or capital in the future and implement our business strategies;\n\u25cf our liabilities could cause our suppliers to change their payment terms, require us to pay for needed goods or services in advance or choose not to do business with us at all which could negatively impact our cash flows, supply chain and our ability to supply products to our customers when needed; and\n\u25cf our liabilities may restrict us from raising additional funds on satisfactory terms to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, and other general corporate requirements.\nIf we are at any time unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our liabilities when payment is due, we may be required to attempt to renegotiate the terms of the instruments relating to the liabilities, seek to refinance all or a portion of the liabilities or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us.\n- 12 -\nWe continue to face challenges in commercializing the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System in the United States and may not succeed in executing our business plan.\nThere are numerous risks and uncertainties inherent in the development of new medical technologies. In addition to our requirement for additional capital, our ability to successfully commercialize the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System in the United States and to execute our business plan successfully is subject to the following risks, among others:\n\u25cf The TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System is rated under a CLIA waiver certification which requires our customers to be certified under the CLIA waiver requirements to be reimbursed under Medicare, including certain parallel state requirements. If our customers are unwilling or unable to comply with such requirements, it could have an adverse effect on their acceptance of and on our ability to market the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System in the United States.\n\u25cf Our suppliers and we will be subject to numerous FDA requirements covering the design, testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling, advertising, promotion and export of the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System and other matters. If our suppliers or we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements, the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System could be subject to restrictions or withdrawals from the market and we could become subject to penalties.\n\u25cf We may be unable to achieve widespread acceptance of the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System among physicians as a result of our inability to establish adequate sales and marketing capabilities, address competition effectively, obtain and enforce patents to protect proprietary rights from use by would-be competitors, retain key personnel, maintain adequate reimbursement for our product to support our pricing policies and ensure sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to support commercialization plans.\nOur business is subject to health care industry and government cost-containment measures that could result in reduced sales of our TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System.\nMost of our customers rely on third-party payers, including government programs and private health insurance plans, to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedures which use our TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System. The continuing efforts of governmental authorities, insurance companies, and other health care payers to contain or reduce these costs could lead to patients being unable to obtain approval for payment from these third-party payers. If patients cannot obtain third-party payer payment approval, the use of our TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System may decline significantly and our customers may reduce or eliminate the use of our system. The cost-containment measures that health care providers are instituting, both in the U.S. and internationally, could harm our ability to operate profitably. For example, managed care organizations successfully negotiate volume discounts for medical products, may choose not to reimburse certain products or reimburse products and a low amount sometimes below our selling price. This could result in lower prices to our customers from their customers and, in turn, reduce the amounts we can charge our customers for our products.\n- 13 -\nIn addition to general health care industry cost-containment, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released its final rule implementing section 216(a) of the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA) that will require reporting entities to report private payer rates paid to laboratories for lab tests, which will be used to calculate Medicare payment rates. This final rule also announces CMS\u2019 decision to move the implementation date for the private payer rate-based fee schedule to January 1, 2018. Reporting entities, which would primarily be certain qualifying customers in the U.S. that derive a certain percentage and volume of their revenue from laboratory tests from Medicare, will report private payer rates for our laboratory tests which will serve under the act as a baseline for future reimbursement. Our product was only minimally impacted by PAMA for the year 2018 through 2020. However, should reimbursement for our products be reduced as a result of PAMA or other cost savings initiatives, this could negatively impact our pricing and commercialization of our products in the U.S.\nIf we are subject to regulatory enforcement action as a result of our failure to comply with regulatory requirements, our commercial operations would be harmed.\nWhile we received 510(k) clearance and CLIA waiver for our TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System, we are subject to significant ongoing regulatory requirements, and if we fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to enforcement action by the FDA or state agencies, including:\n\u25cf adverse publicity, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u25cf repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our product;\n\u25cf operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u25cf delay or refusal of our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products or of new intended uses or modifications to our existing product;\n\u25cf refusal to grant export approval for our products;\n\u25cf withdrawing 510(k) clearances, CLIA waiver or premarket approvals that have already been granted; and\n\u25cf criminal prosecution.\nIf the government initiated any of these enforcement actions, our business could be harmed.\nWe are required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, or the QSR. The QSR is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. The FDA must determine that the facilities which manufacture and assemble our products that are intended for sale in the United States, as well as the manufacturing controls and specifications for these products, are compliant with applicable regulatory requirements, including the QSR. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections. The FDA has not yet inspected our facilities, and we cannot assure you that we will pass any future FDA inspection. Our failure, or the failure of our suppliers, to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse QSR inspection could result in enforcement actions, including a public warning letter, a shutdown of our manufacturing operations, a recall of our product, civil or criminal penalties or other sanctions, which would significantly harm our available inventory and sales and cause our business to suffer.\n- 14 -\nIf we are unable to fully comply with federal and state \u201cfraud and abuse laws,\u201d we could face substantial penalties, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including the U.S. Anti- Kickback Statute, physician self-referral laws (the \u201cStark Law\u201d), the U.S. False Claims Act, the U.S. False Statements Statute, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and state law equivalents to these U.S. federal laws, which may not be limited to government-reimbursed items and may not contain identical exceptions. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal and state health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations. Any action against us for violation of these laws could have a significant impact on our business. In addition, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Any action against us for violation by us or our agents or distributors of this act could have a significant impact on our business.\nIf we fail to comply with contractual obligations and applicable laws and regulations governing the handling of patient identifiable medical information, we could suffer material losses or be adversely affected by exposure to material penalties and liabilities.\nMany, if not all of our customers, are covered entities under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of August 1996 or HIPAA. As part of the operation of our business, we provide reimbursement assistance to certain of our customers and as a result we act in the capacity of a business associate with respect to any patient-identifiable medical information, or PHI, we receive in connection with these services. We and our customers must comply with a variety of requirements related to the handling of patient information, including laws and regulations protecting the privacy, confidentiality and security of PHI. The provisions of HIPAA require our customers to have business associate agreements with us under which we are required to appropriately safeguard the PHI we create or receive on their behalf. Further, we and our customers are required to comply with HIPAA security regulations that require us and them to implement certain administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic PHI, or EPHI. We are required by regulation and contract to protect the security of EPHI that we create, receive, maintain or transmit for our customers consistent with these regulations. To comply with our regulatory and contractual obligations, we may have to reorganize processes and invest in new technologies. We also are required to train personnel regarding HIPAA requirements. If we, or any of our employees or consultants, are unable to maintain the privacy, confidentiality and security of the PHI that is entrusted to us, we and/or our customers could be subject to civil and criminal fines and sanctions and we could be found to have breached our contracts with our customers. Under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH Act, and recent omnibus revisions to the HIPAA regulations, we are directly subject to HIPAA\u2019s criminal and civil penalties for breaches of our privacy and security obligations and are required to comply with security breach notification requirements. The direct applicability of the HIPAA privacy and security provisions and compliance with the notification requirements requires us to incur additional costs and may restrict our business operations.\nOur patents may not be valid, and we may not obtain and enforce patents to protect our proprietary rights from use by would-be competitors. Companies with other patents could require us to stop using or pay to use required technology.\nOur owned and licensed patents may not be valid, and we may not obtain and enforce patents to maintain trade secret protection for our technology. The extent to which we are unable to do so could materially harm our business.\n- 15 -\nWe have applied for, and intend to continue to apply for, patents relating to the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System and related technology and processes as well as the TearLab Discovery TM System. Such applications may not result in the issuance of any patents, and any patents now held or that may be issued may not provide adequate protection from competition. Furthermore, it is possible that patents issued or licensed to us may be challenged successfully. In that event, if we have a preferred competitive position because of any such patents, any preferred position would be lost. If we are unable to secure or to continue to maintain a preferred position, the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System could become subject to competition from the sale of similar competing products.\nPatents issued or licensed to us may be infringed by the products or processes of others. The cost of enforcing patent rights against infringers, if such enforcement is required, could be significant and the time demands could interfere with our normal operations. There has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical technology industries. We are currently involved in litigation defending our patent rights in Canada. The Company initiated a patent infringement lawsuit against i-Med Pharma, Inc. in February of 2016 alleging infringement of the Company\u2019s Canadian patent. In February 2018, the Federal Court of Canada issued a ruling in favor of i-Med Pharma, Inc. which invalidated specific claims in the Company\u2019s Canadian patent which were alleged to be infringed. As part of the ruling, the Federal Court ruling awarded costs to i-Med Pharma, Inc., for $0.5 million. The final $0.2 million was paid in April 2018. The Company is appealing this ruling to the Canadian Federal Appellate Court. This and other efforts to defend our rights could incur significant costs and may or may not be resolved in our favor. We could become a party to additional patent litigation and other proceedings. The cost to us of any patent litigation, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Some of our would-be competitors may sustain the costs of such litigation more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Litigation also may absorb significant management time.\nUnpatented trade secrets, improvements, confidential know-how and continuing technological innovation are important to our future scientific and commercial success. Although we attempt, and will continue to attempt, to protect our proprietary information through reliance on trade secret laws and the use of confidentiality agreements with corporate partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and other appropriate means, these measures may not effectively prevent disclosure of our proprietary information, and, in any event, others may develop independently, or obtain access to, the same or similar information.\nCertain of our patent rights are licensed to us by third parties. If we fail to comply with the terms of these license agreements, our rights to those patents may be terminated, and we will be unable to conduct our business.\nIt is possible that a court may find us to be infringing upon validly issued patents of third parties. In that event, in addition to the cost of defending the underlying suit for infringement, we may have to pay license fees and/or damages and may be enjoined from conducting certain activities. Obtaining licenses under third-party patents can be costly, and such licenses may not be available at all.\nWe may face future product liability claims.\nThe testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of therapeutic and diagnostic products entail significant inherent risks of allegations of product liability. Our past use of the RHEO\u2122 System and the components of the SOLX Glaucoma System in clinical trials and the commercial sale of those products may have exposed us to potential liability claims. Our use of the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System and its commercial sale could also expose us to liability claims. All of such claims might be made directly by patients, health care providers or others selling the products. We carry clinical trials and product liability insurance to cover certain claims that could arise, or that could have arisen, during our clinical trials or during the commercial use of our products. We currently maintain clinical trials and product liability insurance with aggregate annual coverage limits of $2.0 million. Such coverage, and any coverage obtained in the future, may be inadequate to protect us in the event of successful product liability claims, and we may not increase the amount of such insurance coverage or even renew it. A successful product liability claim could materially harm our business. In addition, substantial, complex or extended litigation could result in the incurrence of large expenditures and the diversion of significant resources.\n- 16 -\nIf we do not introduce new commercially successful products in a timely manner, our products may become obsolete over time, customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline.\nDemand for our products may change in ways we may not anticipate because of:\n\u25cf evolving customer needs;\n\u25cf the introduction of new products and technologies; and\n\u25cf evolving industry standards.\nWithout the timely introduction of new commercially successful products and enhancements, our products may become obsolete over time, in which case our sales and operating results would suffer. The success of our new product offerings will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\n\u25cf properly identify and anticipate customer needs;\n\u25cf commercialize new products in a cost-effective and timely manner;\n\u25cf manufacture and deliver products in sufficient volumes on time;\n\u25cf obtain and maintain regulatory approval for such new products;\n\u25cf differentiate our offerings from competitors\u2019 offerings;\n\u25cf achieve positive clinical outcomes; and\n\u25cf provide adequate medical and/or consumer education relating to new products.\nMoreover, innovations generally will require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine the commercial viability of these innovations and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund these innovations. In addition, even if we successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products, these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers of each of the key components of the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System and are vulnerable to fluctuations in the availability and price of our suppliers\u2019 products and services.\nWe purchase each of the key components of the TearLab \u00ae Osmolarity System from a limited number of third-party suppliers. Our suppliers may not provide the components or other products needed by us in the quantities requested, in a timely manner or at a price we are willing to pay. In the event we are unable to renew our agreements with our suppliers or they become unable or unwilling to continue to provide important components in the required volumes and quality levels or in a timely manner, or if regulations affecting the components change, we may be required to identify and obtain acceptable replacement supply sources. We may not be able to obtain alternative suppliers or vendors on a timely basis, or at all, which could disrupt or delay, or halt altogether, our ability to manufacture or deliver the TearLab\u00ae Osmolarity System. If any of these events should occur, our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\n- 17 -\nWe face intense competition, and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe face intense competition in the markets for ophthalmic products and these markets are subject to rapid and significant technological change. We have numerous potential competitors in the United States and abroad, including one direct competitor recently launched in Canada. We face potential competition from industry participants marketing conventional technologies for the measurement of osmolarity and other in-lab testing technologies, and commercially available methods, such as the Schirmer Test and ocular surface staining. Many of our potential competitors have substantially more resources and a greater marketing scale than we do. If we are unable to develop and produce or market our products to effectively compete against our competitors, our operating results will materially suffer.\nIf we lose key personnel, or we do not attract and retain highly qualified personnel on a cost-effective basis, it would be more difficult for us to manage our existing business operations and to identify and pursue new growth opportunities.\nOur success depends, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific, clinical, manufacturing and management personnel. In addition, any difficulties in retaining key personnel or managing this growth could disrupt our operations. Future growth will require us to continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, and to continue to recruit, train and retain, additional qualified personnel, which may impose a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure. The competition for qualified personnel in the medical technology field is intense. We are highly dependent on our continued ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified management, clinical and scientific personnel.\nDue to our limited resources, we may not effectively recruit, train and retain additional qualified personnel. If we do not retain key personnel or manage our growth effectively, we may not implement our business plan effectively.\nFurthermore, we have not entered into non-competition agreements with our key employees. In addition, we do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance on any of our officers, employees or consultants. The loss of the services of existing personnel, the failure to recruit additional key scientific, technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner, and the loss of our employees to our competitors would harm our research and development programs and our business.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, which would adversely affect our consolidated operating results, our ability to operate our business and our stock price.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Failure on our part to maintain effective internal financial and accounting controls would cause our financial reporting to be unreliable, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows, and could cause the trading price of our common stock to fall dramatically.\nMaintaining proper and effective internal controls will require substantial management time and attention and may result in our incurring substantial incremental expenses, including with respect to increasing the breadth and depth of our finance organization to ensure that we have personnel with the appropriate qualifications and training in certain key accounting roles and adherence to certain control disciplines within the accounting and reporting function. Any failure in internal controls or any errors or delays in our financial reporting would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could have a substantial adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock.\n- 18 -\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our management does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Our management has identified control deficiencies in the past and may identify additional deficiencies in the future.\nWe cannot be certain that the actions we are taking to improve our internal controls over financial reporting will be sufficient or that any changes in processes and procedures can be completed in a timely manner. In future periods, if the process required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 reveals material weaknesses or significant deficiencies, the correction of any such material weaknesses or significant deficiencies could require additional remedial measures which could be costly and time-consuming. In addition, we may be unable to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis. Any of the foregoing could cause investors to lose confidence in the reliability of our consolidated financial statements, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and make it more difficult for us to finance our operations and growth.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock was delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market, which could make trading in our common stock more difficult for investors, potentially leading to declines in our share price and liquidity and could limit our ability to raise additional capital.\nEffective at the open of business on November 9, 2017, our common stock was suspended and effectively delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market and began trading on the OTCQB. The delisting was the result of our non-compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b).\nOur delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market could make trading in our common stock more difficult for investors, potentially leading to declines in our share price and liquidity. Without The Nasdaq Capital Market listing, stockholders may have a difficult time getting a quote for the sale or purchase of our stock, the sale or purchase of our stock will likely be made more difficult and the trading volume and liquidity of our stock could decline. Our delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market could also result in negative publicity and could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. The absence of such a listing may adversely impact the acceptance of our common stock as currency or the value accorded by other parties. Further, following our delisting, we will also incur additional costs under state blue sky laws in connection with any sales of our securities. These requirements could severely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and the ability of our stockholders to sell our common stock in the secondary market.\nNow that our common stock is traded on an over the counter quotation system, an investor may find it more difficult to sell our stock or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock.\nFollowing the delisting of our common stock, our common stock now falls within the definition of a \u201cpenny stock\u201d as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, and is covered by Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act. Rule 15g-9 imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by Rule 15g-9, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, Rule 15g-9 will affect the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell our securities, and accordingly will affect the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the public market. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market prices for, and the trading volumes of, securities of medical device companies, such as ours, have been historically volatile. The market has experienced, from time to time, significant price and volume fluctuations unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. In addition, the fact that our common stock now trades on the OTCQB market could contribute to trading volumes in our shares being sporadic and volatility in the share price. If adverse market conditions exist, you may have difficulty selling your shares. The market price of our common shares may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u25cf the results of pre-clinical testing and clinical trials by us, our collaborators and/or our competitors;\n\u25cf technological innovations or new diagnostic products;\n\u25cf governmental regulations and reimbursement levels;\n\u25cf developments in patent or other proprietary rights;\n\u25cf litigation;\n\u25cf public concern regarding the safety of products developed by us or others;\n\u25cf comments by securities analysts;\n\u25cf fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results;\n\u25cf the issuance of additional shares to obtain financing or for acquisitions;\n\u25cf general market conditions in our industry or in the economy as a whole;\n\u25cf political instability, natural disasters, war and/or events of terrorism; and\n\u25cf the impact of our delisting from The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our stock, regardless of actual operating performance. In the past, securities class action litigation often follows periods of volatility in the overall market and market price of a particular company\u2019s securities. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\n- 19 -\nBecause we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock, stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and have no present intention to pay any dividends in the future. We are not profitable and may not earn sufficient revenue to meet all operating cash needs. As a result, we intend to use all available cash and liquid assets in the development of our business. Any future determination about the payment of dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our earnings, if any, our capital requirements, our operating and financial conditions and on such other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders have purchased their shares.\nWarrant holders will not be entitled to any of the rights of common stockholders, but will be subject to all changes made with respect thereto.\nIf you hold warrants, you will not be entitled to any rights with respect to our common stock (including, without limitation, voting rights and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on our common stock), but you will be subject to all changes affecting our common stock. You will have rights with respect to our common stock only if you receive our common stock upon exercise of the warrants and only as of the date when you become a record owner of the shares of our common stock upon such exercise. For example, if a proposed amendment to our charter or bylaws requires stockholder approval and the record date for determining the stockholders of record entitled to vote on the amendment occurs prior to the date that you are deemed to be the owner of the shares of our common stock due upon exercise of your warrants, you will not be entitled to vote on the amendment; although, you will nevertheless be subject to any changes in the powers, preferences or special rights of our common stock.\nWe can issue shares of preferred stock that may adversely affect the rights of holders of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 10.0 million shares of preferred stock with designations, rights, and preferences determined from time to time by our board of directors. Accordingly, our board of directors is empowered, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with dividend, liquidation, conversion, voting or other rights superior to those of holders of our common stock. For example, an issuance of shares of preferred stock could:\n\u25cf adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock;\n\u25cf make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of us;\n\u25cf discourage bids for our common stock at a premium;\n\u25cf limit or eliminate any payments that the holders of our common stock could expect to receive upon our liquidation; or\n\u25cf otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n- 20 -", "PERMNO": 90488, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "TEAR"}
