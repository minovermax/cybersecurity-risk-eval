RISK FACTORS\nAny of the following risks could harm our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition and an investment in our\nstock.\nThe risks discussed below also include forward-looking statements, and our\nactual results may differ substantially\nfrom those discussed in these forward-looking statements.\nOperational Risks\nMarket conditions and economic cyclicality may adversely affect our industry.\nWe believe the following,\namong other things, may affect us in 2022:\n\u25cf\nThe COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the economy beginning late in the first quarter\nof 2020, and continues.\nAuburn University, government\nagencies and businesses were limited to remote work and gatherings\nwere limited.\nSupply chains continue to be disrupted and unemployment spiked and remains\nhigh.\nHotels, motels, restaurants,\nretail and shopping centers were especially affected.\n\u25cf\nExtraordinary monetary and fiscal stimulus in 2020 and in early 2021\nhave offset certain of the pandemic\u2019s\nadverse economic effects.\nInflation is running at levels unseen in decades and the Federal Reserve is\ncontemplating raising target interest rates and reducing its securities\nholdings.\nThe nature and timing of any future\nchanges in monetary and fiscal policies and their effect on us cannot be\npredicted.\n\u25cf\nMarket developments, including unemployment, price levels, stock and\nbond market volatility, and changes,\nincluding those resulting from COVID-19 and the pace of vaccination and expected\ndeclines in serious COVID-19\ncases, and Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine affect\nconsumer confidence levels, economic activity and inflation.\nChanges in payment behaviors and payment rates may increase in delinquencies and\ndefault rates, which could\naffect our earnings and credit quality.\n\u25cf\nOur ability to assess the creditworthiness of our customers and those we do business\nwith, and the values of our\nassets and loan collateral may be adversely affected and less\npredictable as a result of the pandemic and\ngovernment responses.\nThe accounting for loan modifications and deferrals may provide only temporary\nrelief.\nThe process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure or estimate the\nvalue of certain assets\nrequires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, including\nforecasts of economic conditions and how those\neconomic predictions might affect the ability of our borrowers\nto repay their loans or the value of assets.\n\u25cf\nThe end of the LIBOR reference rate is currently scheduled for most tenors by June 30, 2023,\nalthough U.S. bank\nregulators informed banks November 30, 2020 that they should stop using LIBOR\nfor new loans and contracts and\nderivatives, including hedging, and involves risks of potential marked disruption and costs\nof compliance and\nconversion.\nNew hedges may not be as effective as hedges based on LIBOR.\nNonperforming and similar assets take significant time to resolve\nand may adversely affect our results of operations\nand\nfinancial condition.\nOur nonperforming loans were 0.10% of total loans as of December 31,\n2021, and we had $0.4 million in other real estate\nowned (\u201cOREO\u201d).\nNon-performing assets may adversely affect our net income in various\nways.\nWe do\nnot record interest\nincome on nonaccrual loans or OREO and these assets require higher loan administration\nand other costs, thereby adversely\naffecting our income.\nDecreases in the value of these assets, or the underlying collateral, or\nin the related borrowers\u2019\nperformance or financial condition, whether or not due to economic and\nmarket conditions beyond our control, could\nadversely affect our business, results of operations and\nfinancial condition.\nIn addition, the resolution of nonperforming\nassets requires commitments of time from management, which can be detrimental\nto the performance of their other\nresponsibilities. Our non-performing assets may be adversely affected\nby loan deferrals and modifications made in response\nto the pandemic and the moratoria on foreclosures and evictions.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not experience\nincreases in nonperforming loans in the future, much of which is affected\nby the economy and the levels of interest rates,\ngenerally.\nOur allowance for loan losses may prove\ninadequate or we may be negatively affected by credit risk exposures.\nWe periodically review\nour allowance for loan losses for adequacy considering economic conditions and\ntrends, collateral\nvalues and credit quality indicators, including past charge-off experience\nand levels of past due loans and nonperforming\nassets.\nWe cannot be\ncertain that our allowance for loan losses will be adequate over time to\ncover credit losses in our\nportfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy,\nincluding the continuing effects of the pandemic and\nfiscal and monetary response to COVID-19, loan modifications and deferrals,\nmarket conditions or events adversely\naffecting specific customers, industries or markets, including\ndisruptions of supply chains and war, and changes\nin\nborrower behaviors.\nCertain borrowers may not recover fully or may fail as a result of COVID\n-19 effects.\nIf the credit\nquality of our customer base materially decreases, if the risk profile of the\nmarket, industry or group of customers changes\nmaterially or weaknesses in the real estate markets worsen, borrower payment\nbehaviors change, or if our allowance for\nloan losses is not adequate, our business, financial condition, including our liquidity\nand capital, and results of operations\ncould be materially adversely affected.\nCECL, a new accounting standard for estimating loan losses, is effective\nfor the\nCompany beginning January 1, 2023, and its effects upon the Company\nhave not yet been determined.\nChanges in the real estate markets, including\nthe secondary market for residential mortgage loans,\nmay continue to\nadversely affect us.\nThe CFPB\u2019s mortgage and servicing rules,\nincluding TRID rules for closed end credit transactions, enforcement actions,\nreviews and settlements, affect the mortgage markets and our\nmortgage operations.\nThe CFPB requires that lenders\ndetermine whether a consumer has the ability to repay a mortgage loan have limited\nthe secondary market for and liquidity\nof many mortgage loans that are not \u201cqualified mortgages.\u201d\nRecently adopted changes to the CFPB\u2019s\nqualified mortgage\nrules are reportedly being reconsidered.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs\nAct\u2019s (the \u201c2017 Tax\nAct\u201d) limitations on the deductibility of residential mortgage interest and state\nand local property and other taxes and federal moratoria on single-family\nforeclosures and rental evictions could adversely\naffect consumer behaviors and the volumes of housing sales,\nmortgage and home equity loan originations, as well as the\nvalue and liquidity of residential property held as collateral by lenders such as the Bank, and\nthe secondary markets for\nsingle and multi-family loans.\nAcquisition, construction and development loans for residential development\nmay be\nsimilarly adversely affected.\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac (\u201cGSEs\u201d), have been in conservatorship since September\n2008.\nSince Fannie Mae and\nFreddie Mac dominate the residential mortgage markets, any changes in their\noperations and requirements, as well as their\nrespective restructurings and capital, could adversely affect the\nprimary and secondary mortgage markets, and our\nresidential mortgage businesses, our results of operations and the returns on capital\ndeployed in these businesses.\nThe\ntiming and effects of resolution of these government sponsored\nenterprises cannot be predicted.\nWeaknesses in real estate\nmarkets the FHFA\u2019s\nmoratoria on foreclosures and real estate owned evictions may adversely\naffect the length of time and costs required to manage and dispose\nof, and the values realized from the sale of our OREO.\nWe may be contractually\nobligated to repurchase\nmortgage loans we sold to third parties on terms unfavorable\nto us.\nAs part of its routine business, the Company originates mortgage loans that it subsequently\nsells in the secondary market,\nincluding to governmental agencies and GSEs.\nIn connection with the sale of these loans, the Company makes customary\nrepresentations and warranties, the breach of which may result in the Company\nbeing required to repurchase the loan or\nloans.\nFurthermore, the amount paid may be greater than the fair value of the loan or loans at the time\nof the repurchase.\nAlthough mortgage loan repurchase requests made to us have been limited, if these increased,\nwe may have to establish\nreserves for possible repurchases and adversely affect our results of operation\nand financial condition.\nMortgage servicing rights requirements\nmay change and require\nus to incur additional costs and risks.\nThe CFPB\u2019s residential mortgage servicing\nstandards may adversely affect our costs to service residential\nmortgage loans,\nand together with the Basel III Rules and the effects of lower interest rates\nfrom COVID-19 stimulus, may decrease the\nreturns on, and values of, our MSRs.\nThis could reduce our income from servicing these types of loans and\nmake it more\ndifficult and costly to timely realize the value of collateral securing\nsuch loans upon a borrower default.\nIn contrast, rising\ninterest rates would be expected to reduce mortgage refinancings and extend the duration\nof our MSRs.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nWe routinely execute\ntransactions with counterparties in the financial services industry,\nincluding brokers and dealers,\ncentral clearinghouses, banks, including our correspondent banks and other\nfinancial institutions.\nOur ability to engage in\nroutine investment and banking transactions, as well as the quality and values of our investments\nin holdings of other\nobligations of other financial institutions such as the FHLB, could be adversely affected\nby the actions, financial condition,\nand profitability of such other financial institutions, including the FHLB\nand our correspondent banks.\nFinancial services\ninstitutions are interrelated as a result of shared credits, trading, clearing, counterparty and\nother relationships.\nAny losses,\ndefaults by, or failures of, the institutions\nwe do business with could adversely affect our holdings of the equity in\nsuch\nother institutions, our participation interests in loans originated by other institutions,\nand our business, including our\nliquidity, financial condition and\nearnings.\nOur concentration of commercial real\nestate loans could result in further increased\nloan losses, and adversely affect our\nbusiness, earnings, and financial condition.\nCommercial real estate, or CRE, is cyclical and poses risks of possible loss due to concentration\nlevels and risks of the\nassets being financed, which include loans for the acquisition and development of land and\nresidential construction.\nThe\nfederal bank regulatory agencies released guidance in 2006 on \u201cConcentrations\nin Commercial Real Estate Lending.\u201d\nThe\nguidance defines CRE loans as exposures secured by raw land, land development\nand construction loans (including 1-4\nfamily residential construction loans), multi-family property,\nand non-farm non-residential property,\nwhere the primary or a\nsignificant source of repayment is derived from rental income associated\nwith the property (that is, loans for which 50% or\nmore of the source of repayment comes from third party,\nnon-affiliated, rental income) or the proceeds of the sale,\nrefinancing, or permanent financing of the property.\nLoans to REITs\nand unsecured loans to developers that closely\ncorrelate to the inherent risks in CRE markets are also CRE loans.\nLoans on owner occupied commercial real estate are\ngenerally excluded from CRE for purposes of this guidance.\nExcluding owner occupied commercial real estate, we had\n50.0% of our portfolio in CRE loans at year-end 2021 compared to 43.6% at year-end 2020.\nThe banking regulators\ncontinue to give CRE lending scrutiny and require banks with higher levels\nof CRE loans to implement improved\nunderwriting, internal controls, risk management policies and portfolio\nstress testing, as well as higher levels of allowances\nfor possible losses and capital levels as a result of CRE lending growth and exposures.\nLower demand for CRE, and\nreduced availability of, and higher interest rates and costs for,\nCRE lending could adversely affect our CRE loans and sales\nof our OREO, and therefore our earnings and financial condition, including our capital and\nliquidity.\nAt year-end 2021, 21% of our total loans were CRE loans to\nhotels/motels, retail and shopping centers and restaurants,\nbusinesses that were severely affected\nby the effects of COVID-19.\nOur future success is dependent on our ability\nto compete effectively in highly competitive markets.\nThe East Alabama banking markets which we operate are\nhighly competitive and our future growth and success will\ndepend on our ability to compete effectively in these markets.\nWe compete for loans, deposits\nand other financial services\nwith other local, regional and national commercial banks, thrifts, credit unions,\nmortgage lenders, and securities and\ninsurance brokerage firms.\nLenders operating nationwide over the internet are growing rapidly.\nMany of our competitors\noffer products and services different from us, and\nhave substantially greater resources, name recognition and market\npresence than we do, which benefits them in attracting business.\nIn addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans\nand deposits more aggressively than we are able to and have broader and more diverse customer\nand geographic bases to\ndraw upon.\nOut of state banks may branch into our markets.\nFintech and other non-bank competitors also complete for our\ncustomers, and may partner with other banks and/or seek to enter the payments system.\nFailures of other banks with offices\nin our markets could also lead to the entrance of new,\nstronger competitors in our markets.\nOur success depends on local economic conditions.\nOur success depends on the general economic conditions in the geographic\nmarkets we serve in Alabama.\nThe local\neconomic conditions in our markets have a significant effect on our\ncommercial, real estate and construction loans, the\nability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans.\nAdverse changes in the\neconomic conditions of the Southeastern United States in general, or in one or\nmore of our local markets, including the\ncontinuous effects from COVID-19 and the timing, strength\nand breadth of the recovery from the pandemic, could\nnegatively affect our results of operations and our profitability.\nOur local economy is also affected by the growth of\nautomobile manufacturing and related suppliers located in our markets and\nnearby.\nAuto sales are cyclical and are affected\nadversely by higher interest rates.\nAttractive acquisition opportunities may not be available to us in\nthe future.\nWhile we seek continued organic growth, we also may consider\nthe acquisition of other businesses.\nWe expect that other\nbanking and financial companies, many of which have significantly\ngreater resources, will compete with us to acquire\nfinancial services businesses.\nThis competition could increase prices for potential acquisitions that we believe are\nattractive.\nAlso, acquisitions are subject to various regulatory approvals.\nIf we fail to receive the appropriate regulatory\napprovals, we will not be able to consummate an acquisition that\nwe believe is in our best interests, and regulatory\napprovals could contain conditions that reduce the anticipated benefits of any transaction.\nAmong other things, our\nregulators consider our capital, liquidity,\nprofitability, regulatory compliance\nand levels of goodwill and intangibles when\nconsidering acquisition and expansion proposals.\nAny acquisition could be dilutive to our earnings and shareholders\u2019\nequity per share of our common stock.\nFuture acquisitions and expansion activities may\ndisrupt our business, dilute shareholder\nvalue and adversely affect our\noperating results.\nWe regularly evaluate\npotential acquisitions and expansion opportunities, including new branches and\nother offices.\nTo the\nextent that we grow through acquisitions, we cannot assure you that\nwe will be able to adequately or profitably manage this\ngrowth.\nAcquiring other banks, branches, or businesses, as well as other geographic and product\nexpansion activities,\ninvolve various risks including:\n\u25cf\nrisks of unknown or contingent liabilities, and potential asset quality issues;\n\u25cf\nunanticipated costs and delays;\n\u25cf\nrisks that acquired new businesses will not perform consistent with our growth\nand profitability expectations;\n\u25cf\nrisks of entering new markets or product areas where we have limited experience;\n\u25cf\nrisks that growth will strain our infrastructure, staff, internal\ncontrols and management, which may require\nadditional personnel, time and expenditures;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties, expenses and delays of integrating the operations and personnel of\nacquired institutions;\n\u25cf\npotential disruptions to our business;\n\u25cf\npossible loss of key employees and customers of acquired institutions;\n\u25cf\npotential short-term decreases in profitability; and\n\u25cf\ndiversion of our management\u2019s\ntime and attention from our existing operations and business.\nTechnological\nchanges affect our business, and we may have fewer resources\nthan many competitors to invest in\ntechnological improvements.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid\ntechnological changes with frequent introductions of new technology\ndriven products and services and growing demands for mobile and user-based\nbanking applications. In addition to allowing\nus to analyze our customers better, the effective\nuse of technology may increase efficiency and may enable\nfinancial\ninstitutions to reduce costs, risks associated with fraud and compliance\nwith anti-money laundering and other laws, and\nvarious operational risks. Largely unregulated \u201cfintech\u201d businesses\nhave increased their participation in the lending and\npayments businesses, and have increased competition in these businesses. Our\nfuture success will depend, in part, upon our\nability to use technology to provide products and services that meet our customers\u2019 preferences\nand create additional\nefficiencies in operations, while avoiding cyber-attacks\nand disruptions, data breaches and anti-money laundering\nviolations. The COVID-19 pandemic and increased remote work has accelerated\nelectronic banking activity and the need\nfor increased operational efficiencies.\nWe\nmay need to make significant additional capital investments in technology,\nincluding cyber and data security,\nand we may not be able to effectively implement new technology\n-driven products and\nservices, or such technology may prove less effective than anticipated.\nMany larger competitors have substantially greater\nresources to invest in technological improvements and, increasingly,\nnon-banking firms are using technology to compete\nwith traditional lenders for loans and other banking services.\nAs a result, our competition from service providers not\nlocated in our markets has increased.\nOperational risks are inherent\nin our businesses.\nOperational risks and losses can result from internal and external fraud; gaps or\nweaknesses in our risk management or\ninternal audit procedures; errors by employees or third parties, including our\nvendors, failures to document transactions\nproperly or obtain proper authorizations; failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements\nin the various\njurisdictions where we do business or have customers; failures in our estimates\nmodels that rely on; equipment failures,\nincluding those caused by natural disasters, or by electrical, telecommunications\nor other essential utility outages; business\ncontinuity and data security system failures, including those caused by computer\nviruses, cyberattacks, unforeseen\nproblems encountered while implementing major new computer systems or,\nfailures to timely and properly upgrade and\npatch existing systems or inadequate access to data or poor response capabilities in\nlight of such business continuity and\ndata security system failures; or the inadequacy or failure of systems and controls,\nincluding those of our vendors or\ncounterparties.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic presented operational challenges to\nmaintaining continuity of operations of\ncustomer services while protecting our employees\u2019 and customers\u2019 safety.\nIn addition, we face certain risks inherent in the\nownership and operation\nof our bank premises and other real-estate, including liability for accidents on our properties.\nAlthough we have implemented risk controls and loss mitigation actions, and substantial\nresources are devoted to\ndeveloping efficient procedures, identifying and rectifying\nweaknesses in existing procedures and training staff and\npotential environmental risks, it is not possible to be certain that such actions\nhave been or will be effective in controlling\nthese various operational risks that evolve continuously.\nPotential gaps in our risk management policies and internal audit procedures\nmay leave us exposed unidentified or\nunanticipated risk, which could negatively affect our business.\nOur enterprise risk management and internal audit program is designed to\nmitigate material risks and loss to us. We\nhave\ndeveloped and continue to develop risk management and internal audit policies\nand procedures to reflect the ongoing\nreview of our risks and expect to continue to do so in the future. Nonetheless, our policies\nand procedures may not be\ncomprehensive and may not identify timely every risk to which we are exposed,\nand our internal audit process may fail to\ndetect such weaknesses or deficiencies in our risk management framework.\nMany of our risk management models and\nestimates use observed historical market behavior to model or project\npotential future exposure.\nModels used by our\nbusiness are based on assumptions and projections. These models\nmay not operate properly or our inputs and assumptions\nmay be inaccurate, or changes in economic conditions, customer behaviors\nor regulations.\nAs a result, these methods may\nnot fully predict future exposures, which can be significantly greater than\nhistorically.\nOther risk management methods\ndepend upon the evaluation of information regarding markets, clients, or\nother matters that are publicly available or\notherwise accessible to us. This information may not always be accurate,\ncomplete, up-to-date or properly evaluated.\nFurthermore, there can be no assurance that we can effectively review\nand monitor all risks or that all of our employees will\nclosely follow our risk management policies and procedures, nor can there be any assurance\nthat our risk management\npolicies and procedures will enable us to accurately identify all risks and limit our exposures\nbased on our assessments. In\naddition, we may have to implement more extensive\nand perhaps different risk management policies and procedures\nas our\nregulation changes.\nFor example, the Federal Reserve and the OCC are in the initial stages of proposing\nclimate risk\nmanagement criteria and potential climate risk stress tests.\nThe SEC is expected to require more disclosure on climate\nrisks, also.\nAll of these could adversely affect our financial condition and results\nof operations.\nAny failure to protect\nthe confidentiality of customer information could adversely affect our reputation\nand have a material\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results\nof operations\n.\nVarious\nlaws enforced by the bank regulators and other agencies protect the privacy and security of\ncustomers\u2019 non-public\npersonal information. Many of our employees have access to, and routinely process\npersonal information of clients through\na variety of media, including information technology systems.\nOur internal processes and controls are designed to protect\nthe confidentiality of client information we hold and that is accessible to us and our employees.\nIt is possible that an\nemployee could, intentionally or unintentionally,\ndisclose or misappropriate confidential client information or our data\ncould be the subject of a cybersecurity attack.\nSuch personal data could also be compromised via intrusions into our\nsystems or those of our service providers or persons we do business with such as credit\nbureaus, data processors and\nmerchants who accept credit or debit cards for payment. If we fail to\nmaintain adequate internal controls, or if our\nemployees fail to comply with our policies and procedures, misappropriation\nor inappropriate disclosure or misuse of client\ninformation could occur. Such\ninternal control inadequacies or non-compliance could materially damage our\nreputation,\nlead to remediation costs and civil or criminal penalties.\nThese could have a material adverse effect on our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations.\nOur information systems may experience interruptions and\nsecurity breaches.\nWe rely heavily on communications\nand information systems, including those provided by third-party service\nproviders, to\nconduct our business.\nAny failure, interruption, or security breach of these systems could result in failures\nor disruptions\nwhich could affect our customers\u2019 privacy and our customer\nrelationships, generally.\nOur business continuity plans,\nincluding those of our service providers, to provide back-up and restore service\nmay not be effective in the case of\nwidespread outages due to severe weather,\nnatural disasters, pandemics, or power, communications\nand other failures.\nOur systems and networks, as well as those of our third-party service providers,\nare subject to security risks and could be\nsusceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks,\nhacking, terrorist activities or identity theft.\nCybercrime risks\nhave increased as electronic and mobile banking activities increased as a result\nof the COVID-19 pandemic, and may\nincrease as a result of the Russia invasion of Ukraine.\nOther financial service institutions and their service providers have\nreported material security breaches in their websites or other systems, some of\nwhich have involved sophisticated and\ntargeted attacks, including use of stolen access credentials, malware,\nransomware, phishing and distributed denial-of-\nservice attacks, among other means.\nSuch cyber-attacks may also seek to disrupt the operations of public companies\nor\ntheir business partners, effect unauthorized fund transfers, obtain unauthorized\naccess to confidential information, destroy\ndata, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems.\nDenial of service attacks have been launched against a number of\nfinancial services institutions, and we may be subject to these types of attacks in\nthe future. Hacking and identity theft risks,\nin particular, could cause serious reputational harm.\nDespite our cybersecurity policies and procedures and our Board\nof Director\u2019s and Management\u2019s efforts\nto monitor and\nensure the integrity of the system we use, we may not be able to anticipate the rapidly evolving\nsecurity threats, nor may we\nbe able to implement preventive measures effective against\nall such threats. The techniques used by cyber criminals change\nfrequently, may not be recognize\nd\nuntil launched and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups\nsuch as external service providers, organized crime affiliates,\nterrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. These\nrisks may increase in the future as the use of mobile banking and other internet\nelectronic banking continues to grow.\nSecurity breaches or failures may have serious adverse financial and other consequences,\nincluding significant legal and\nremediation costs, disruptions to operations, misappropriation of confidential information,\ndamage to systems operated by\nus or our third-party service providers, as well as damages to our customers and our\ncounterparties. In addition, these events\ncould damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to additional\nregulatory scrutiny, or expose\nus\nto civil litigation and possible financial liability,\nany of which could have a material adverse effect on\nour financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable\nto attract and retain key people to support our business.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people.\nWe compete\nwith other financial services\ncompanies for people primarily on the basis of compensation and benefits,\nsupport services and financial position. Intense\ncompetition exists for key employees with demonstrated ability,\nand we may be unable to hire or retain such employees.\nEffective succession planning is also important to our long-term\nsuccess. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of\nour key persons and failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge\nand smooth transitions involving such persons could\nhave a material adverse effect on our business due to loss of their skills,\nknowledge of our business, their years of industry\nexperience and the potential difficulty of promptly finding qualified\nreplacement employees.\nProposed rules implementing the executive compensation provisions of the\nDodd-Frank Act may limit the type and\nstructure of compensation arrangements and prohibit the payment of \u201cexcessive\ncompensation\u201d to our executives. These\nrestrictions could negatively affect our ability to compete with other companies\nin recruiting and retaining key personnel.\nSevere weather and natural disasters, including\nas a result of climate change, pandemics, epidemics,\nacts of war or\nterrorism or other external events could\nhave significant effects on our business.\nSevere weather and natural disasters, including hurricanes, tornados,\ndrought and floods, epidemics and pandemics, acts of\nwar or terrorism or other external events could have a significant effect on our\nability to conduct business.\nSuch events\ncould affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers\nto repay outstanding loans, impair the value of\ncollateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue\nand/or cause us to incur additional\nexpenses.\nAlthough management has established disaster recovery and business continuity\npolicies and procedures, the\noccurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect\non our business, which, in turn, could have a material\nadverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, trade wars, tariffs, and similar events and\ndisputes, domestic and international, have adversely\naffected, and may continue to adversely affect economic\nactivity globally,\nnationally and locally.\nMarket interest rates have\ndeclined significantly during 2020, and remain low,\nbut may begin increasing in early 2022 due to inflation.\nSuch events\nalso may adversely affect business and consumer confidence,\ngenerally.\nWe and our customers,\nand our respective\nsuppliers, vendors and processors may be adversely affected\nby rising costs and shortages of needed equipment and\nsupplies.\nAny such adverse changes may adversely affect our profitability,\ngrowth asset quality and financial condition.\nFinancial Risks\nOur ability to realize our deferred\ntax assets may be reduced in the future\nif our estimates of future taxable income from\nour operations and tax planning strategies do not support this amount, and the amount\nof net operating loss carry-forwards\nrealizable for income tax purposes may be reduced\nunder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code by sales of our capital\nsecurities.\nWe are\nallowed to carry-back losses for two years for Federal income tax purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had a\nnet deferred tax asset of $0.4 million with gross deferred tax assets of $1.7\nmillion.\nThese and future deferred tax assets\nmay be further reduced in the future if our estimates of future taxable income from our\noperations and tax planning\nstrategies do not support the amount of the deferred tax asset.\nThe amount of net operating loss carry-forwards realizable\nfor income tax purposes potentially could be further reduced under Section 382\nof the Internal Revenue Code by a\nsignificant offering and/or other sales of our capital securities.\nCurrent bank capital rules also reduce the regulatory capital\nbenefits of deferred tax assets.\nOur cost of funds may increase as a result\nof general economic conditions, interest rates, inflation\nand competitive\npressures.\nThe Federal Reserve shifted to a more accommodating monetary policy in\nSummer 2019. During 2020, the Federal Reserve\nreduced its federal funds target to 0-0.25% and has made significant\nmonthly purchases of U.S. Treasury and agency\nmortgage-backed securities to help stimulate the economy,\nmarket interest rates have increased, possibly as a result of\nincreased government borrowings to finance rounds of fiscal stimulus and\nincreased inflation expectations resulting from\nsuch stimulus and expected increases in economic growth from fiscal and\nmonetary stimulus and COVID-19 vaccinations.\nOur costs of funds may increase as a result of general economic conditions, increasing\ninterest rates and competitive\npressures, and potential inflation resulting from continued government deficit spending\nand monetary policies, and\nanticipated changes by the Federal Reserve to a less accommodative monetary policy.\nTraditionally,\nwe have obtained\nfunds principally through local deposits and borrowings from other institutional\nlenders, which we believe are a cheaper\nand more stable source of funds than borrowings.\nIncreases in interest rates may cause consumers to shift their funds to\nmore interest bearing instruments and to increase the competition for and costs of\ndeposits.\nIf customers move money out\nof bank deposits and into other investment assets or from transaction deposits to higher interest\nbearing time deposits, we\ncould lose a relatively low cost source of funds, increasing our funding costs and reducing our\nnet interest income and net\nincome. Additionally, any\nsuch loss of funds could result in lower loan originations and growth, which could\nmaterially and\nadversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur profitability and liquidity may be\naffected by changes in interest rates and interest\nrate levels, the shape of the yield\ncurve and economic conditions.\nOur profitability depends upon net interest income, which is the difference\nbetween interest earned on interest-earning\nassets, such as loans and investments, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities,\nsuch as deposits and borrowings.\nNet interest income will be adversely affected if market interest\nrates on the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings\nincreases faster than the interest earned on loans and investments.\nInterest rates, and consequently our results of operations,\nare affected by general economic conditions (national, international and\nlocal) and fiscal and monetary policies, as well as\nexpectations of interest rate changes, fiscal and monetary policies and the shape of the\nyield curve.\nOur income is primarily\ndriven by the spread between these rates. As a result, a steeper yield curve,\nmeaning long-term interest rates are\nsignificantly higher than short-term interest rates, would\nprovide the Bank with a better opportunity to increase net interest\nincome. Conversely, a\nflattening yield curve could further pressure our net interest margin\nas our cost of funds increases\nrelative to the spread we can earn on our assets. In addition, net interest income could\nbe affected by asymmetrical changes\nin the different interest rate indexes, given that not all of our assets or liabilities\nare priced with the same index.\nThe\ninterest rate reductions by the Federal Reserve and the effects of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic have reduced market rates,\nwhich adversely affected our net interest income and our results of operations.\nThe production of mortgages and other loans and the value of collateral\nsecuring our loans are dependent on demand within\nthe markets we serve, as well as interest rates.\nLower interest rates typically increase mortgage originations, decrease MSR\nvalues, and facilitate pandemic-related trends to single family houses.\nIncreases in market interest rates would tend to\ndecrease mortgage originations, increase MSR values and potentially increase\nnet interest spread depending upon the yield\ncurve and the magnitude and duration of interest rate increase.\nLiquidity risks could affect operations and jeopardize\nour financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business.\nAn inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, proceeds from loan\nrepayments or sales proceeds from maturing loans and securities, and other sources\ncould have a negative effect on our\nliquidity.\nOur funding sources include federal funds purchased, securities sold under\nrepurchase agreements, core and non-\ncore deposits, and short- and long-term debt.\nWe\nmaintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a source of liquidity.\nWe are\nalso members of the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, where we can obtain advances\ncollateralized\nwith eligible assets.\nThere are other sources of liquidity available to the Company or the Bank\nshould they be needed,\nincluding our ability to acquire additional\nnon-core deposits.\nWe may be able, depending\nupon market conditions, to\notherwise borrow money or issue and sell debt and preferred or common securities in public\nor private transactions.\nOur\naccess to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize our activities\non terms which are acceptable to us\ncould be impaired by factors that affect us specifically,\nor the financial services industry or the economy in general.\nGeneral conditions that are not specific to us, such as disruptions in the financial\nmarkets or negative views and\nexpectations about the prospects for the financial services industry could\nadversely affect us.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic generally has increased our deposits and at banks, generally,\nwhile reducing the interest rates\nearned on loans and securities.\nSuch excess liquidity and the resulting balance sheet growth requires capital support\nand\nmay reduce returns on assets and equity.\nChanges in accounting and tax rules applicable to banks could adversely\naffect our financial conditions and results of\noperations.\nFrom time to time, the FASB\nand the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the\npreparation of our financial statements.\nThese changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact\nhow we record\nand report our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised\nstandard retroactively, resulting\nin us restating prior period financial statements\n.\nThe\nFASB\u2019s\nguidance under ASU No.\n2016-13 includes significant changes to the manner in which banks\u2019 allowance\nfor loan losses will be effective for us\nbeginning January 1, 2023.\nInstead of using historical losses, the CECL model is forward-looking with respect\nto expected\nlosses over the life of loans and other instruments, and could materially affect our\nresults of operations and financial\ncondition, including the variability of our results of operations and our regulatory\ncapital, notwithstanding a three-year\nphase-in of CECL for regulatory capital purposes.\nWe may need\nto raise additional capital in the future, but that capital\nmay not be available when it is needed or on\nfavorable terms.\nWe anticipate that our current\ncapital resources will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable\nfuture under\ncurrently effective rules.\nWe may,\nhowever, need to raise additional capital to\nsupport our growth or currently\nunanticipated losses, or to meet the needs of our communities, resulting from failures or\ncutbacks by our competitors.\nOur\nability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend, among other things,\non conditions in the capital markets at that\ntime, which are limited by events outside our control, and on our financial performance.\nIf we cannot raise additional\ncapital on acceptable terms when needed, our ability to further expand our\noperations through internal growth and\nacquisitions could be limited.\nOur associates may take excessive risks which could negatively affect our financial\ncondition and business.\nBanks are in the business of accepting certain risks.\nOur executive officers and other members of management,\nsales\nintermediaries, investment professionals, product managers, and\nother associates, make decisions and choices that involve\nexposing us to risk. We endeavor,\nin the design and implementation of our compensation programs and practices, to avoid\ngiving our associates incentives to take excessive risks; however,\nassociates may nonetheless take such risks.\nSimilarly,\nalthough we employ controls and procedures designed to prevent misconduct,\nto monitor associates\u2019 business decisions and\nprevent them from taking excessive risks, these controls and procedures\nmay not be effective. If our associates take\nexcessive risks, risks to our reputation, financial condition and business operations\ncould be materially and adversely\naffected.\nOur ability to continue to pay dividends to shareholders\nin the future is subject to our profitability,\ncapital, liquidity and\nregulatory requirements\nand these limitations may prevent or limit future\ndividends.\nCash available to pay dividends to our shareholders is derived primarily from dividends paid\nto the Company by the Bank.\nThe ability of the Bank to pay dividends, as well as our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders,\nwill continue to be\nsubject to and limited by laws limiting dividend payments by the Bank, the results of operations\nof our subsidiaries and our\nneed to maintain appropriate liquidity and capital at all levels of our business consistent\nwith regulatory requirements and\nthe needs of our businesses.\nSee \u201cSupervision and Regulation\u201d.\nA limited trading market exists for our common shares,\nwhich could result in price volatility.\nYour\nability to sell or purchase common shares depends upon the existence of an active trading\nmarket for our common\nstock.\nAlthough our common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Global Market under the trading\nsymbol \u201cAUBN,\u201d our historic\ntrading volume has been limited historically.\nAs a result, you may be unable to sell or purchase shares of our common\nstock at the volume, price and time that you desire.\nAdditionally, whether the purchase\nor sales prices of our common stock\nreflects a reasonable valuation of our common stock also is affected\nby limited trading market, and thus the price you\nreceive for a thinly-traded stock such as our common stock, may not reflect its true or intrinsic\nvalue.\nThe limited trading\nmarket for our common stock may cause fluctuations in the market value of our common\nstock to be exaggerated, leading\nto price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading\nmarket.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nThe Company is an entity separate and distinct from\nthe Bank.\nThe Company is an entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Company transactions\nwith the Bank are limited by Sections\n23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Federal Reserve Regulation\nW.\nWe depend upon the Bank\u2019s\nearnings and\ndividends, which are limited by law and regulatory policies and actions, for cash to pay the\nCompany\u2019s debt and corporate\nobligations, and to pay dividends to our shareholders.\nIf the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends to the Company\nwas\nterminated or limited, the Company\u2019s liquidity\nand financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nLegislative and regulatory changes\nThe Biden Administration is appointing new members to FDIC and Federal\nReserve Board, and has appointed an acting\nComptroller of the Currency and a new full time CFPB director.\nThis Administration and its appointees propose changes to\nbank regulation and corporate tax changes that could have an adverse effect\non our results of operations and financial\nconditions.\nWe are\nsubject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict\nour activities and adversely affect our earnings.\nWe and our subsidiaries are\nregulated by several regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the\nAlabama Superintendent,\nthe SEC and the FDIC.\nOur success is affected by state and federal laws and regulations affecting\nbanks and bank holding\ncompanies, and the securities markets, and our costs of compliance could adversely affect\nour earnings.\nBanking\nregulations are primarily intended to protect depositors, and the FDIC Deposit Insurance\nFund (\u201cDIF\u201d), not shareholders.\nThe financial services industry also is subject to frequent legislative and regulatory\nchanges and proposed changes.\nIn\naddition, the interpretations of regulations by regulators may change and statutes\nmay be enacted with retroactive impact.\nFrom time to time, regulators raise issues during examinations of us which,\nif not determined satisfactorily,\ncould have a\nmaterial adverse effect on us. Compliance with applicable\nlaws and regulations is time consuming and costly and may\naffect our profitability. The\nposition of the President and his administration that took office\nin January 2021 with respect to\nregulation of banks and bank holding companies is not yet fully known, but\ntheir views and actions could have a material\nadverse effect on financial services regulation, generally.\nLitigation and regulatory actions could harm\nour reputation and adversely affect our results\nof operations and financial\ncondition.\nA substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against us, as well as regulatory\ninquiries or investigations,\ncould harm our reputation, result in material fines or penalties, result in significant\nlegal and other costs, divert management\nresources away from our business, and otherwise have a material adverse\neffect on our ability to expand on our existing\nbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we ultimately\nprevail in litigation, regulatory investigation or\naction, our ability to attract new customers, retain our current customers and recruit and\nretain employees could be\nmaterially and adversely affected. Regulatory inquiries and litigation\nmay also adversely affect the prices or volatility of\nour securities specifically, or the\nsecurities of our industry,\ngenerally.\nWe are\nrequired to maintain\ncapital to meet regulatory requirements,\nand if we fail to maintain sufficient capital, our\nfinancial condition, liquidity and results of operations\nwould be adversely affected.\nWe and the Bank\nmust meet regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient\nliquidity, including liquidity\nat the\nCompany, as well as the Bank.\nIf we fail to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements, including\nmore rigorous\nrequirements arising from our regulators\u2019 implementation of Basel III,\nour financial condition, liquidity and results of\noperations would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur failure to remain \u201cwell capitalized\u201d and \u201cwell managed\u201d,\nincluding meeting the Basel III capital conservation buffers,\nfor bank regulatory purposes, could affect customer\nconfidence, our ability to grow, our\ncosts of funds and FDIC insurance, our ability to raise brokered deposits,\nour ability to\npay dividends on our common stock and our ability to make acquisitions, and\nwe may no longer meet the requirements for\nbecoming a financial holding company.\nThese could also affect our ability to use discretionary bonuses\nto attract and retain\nquality personnel.\nThe Basel III Capital Rules include a minimum ratio of common equity\ntier 1 capital, or CET1, to risk-\nweighted assets of 4.5% and a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of risk-weighted\nassets.\nSee\n\u201cSupervision and\nRegulation-Basel III Capital Rules.\u201d\nAlthough we currently have capital ratios that exceed all these minimum levels and\na strategic plan to maintain these levels, we or the Bank may be unable to continue\nto satisfy the capital adequacy\nrequirements for various reasons, which may include:\n\u2022\nlosses and/or increases in the Bank\u2019s credit\nrisk assets and expected losses resulting from the deterioration in the\ncreditworthiness of borrowers and the issuers of equity and debt securities;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in refinancing or issuing instruments upon redemption or\nat maturity of such instruments to raise capital\nunder acceptable terms and conditions;\n\u2022\ndeclines in the value of our securities portfolios;\n\u2022\nrevisions to the regulations or their application by our regulators that increase our capital requirements;\n\u2022\nreduced total earnings on our assets will reduce our internal generation of capital\navailable to support our balance\nsheet growth;\n\u2022\nreductions in the value of our MSRs and DTAs;\nand other adverse developments; and\n\u2022\nunexpected growth and an inability to increase capital timely.\nA failure to remain \u201cwell capitalized,\u201d for bank regulatory purposes, including\nmeeting the Basel III Capital Rule\u2019s\nconservation buffer, could adversely affect\ncustomer confidence, and our:\n\u2022\nability to grow;\n\u2022\nthe costs of and availability of funds;\n\u2022\nFDIC deposit insurance premiums;\n\u2022\nability to raise or replace brokered deposits;\n\u2022\nability to pay or increase dividends on our capital stock.\n\u2022\nability to make discretionary bonuses to attract and retain quality personnel;\n\u2022\nability to make acquisitions or engage in new activities;\n\u2022\nflexibility if we become subject to prompt corrective action restrictions;\n\u2022\nability to make payments of principal and interest on our capital instruments; and\nThe Federal Reserve may require\nus to commit capital resources\nto support the Bank.\nAs a matter of policy, the Federal\nReserve expects a bank holding company to act as a source of financial and\nmanagerial\nstrength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. The\nFederal Reserve may require a\nbank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act amended\nthe FDI Act to require that all companies that control a FDIC-insured depository institution\nserve as a source of financial\nstrength to their depository institution subsidiaries. Under these requirements,\nwe could be required to provide financial\nassistance to the Bank should it experience financial distress, even if further investment\nwas not otherwise warranted. See\n\u201cSupervision and Regulation.\u201d\nOur operations are subject to risk of loss from\nunfavorable fiscal, monetary and political developments in the\nU.S.\nOur businesses and earnings are affected by the fiscal, monetary and other\npolicies and actions of various U.S.\ngovernmental and regulatory authorities. Changes in these are beyond our control\nand are difficult to predict and,\nconsequently, changes in these\npolicies could have negative effects on our activities and results of operations.\nFailures of\nthe executive and legislative branches to agree on spending plans and budgets previously\nhave led to Federal government\nshutdowns, which may adversely affect the U.S. economy.\nAdditionally, any prolonged\ngovernment shutdown may inhibit\nour ability to evaluate the economy,\ngenerally, and affect\ngovernment workers who are not paid during such events, and\nwhere the absence of government services and data could adversely affect consumer\nand business sentiment, our local\neconomy and our customers and therefore our business.\nLitigation and regulatory investigations are\nincreasingly common in our businesses and may result\nin significant financial\nlosses and/or harm to our reputation.\nWe face risks of litigation\nand regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating\nour businesses,\nincluding the risk of class action lawsuits. Plaintiffs in class\naction and other lawsuits against us may seek very large and/or\nindeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages. Due to the vagaries of litigation,\nthe ultimate outcome of\nlitigation and the amount or range of potential loss at particular points in time may be difficult\nto ascertain. We\ndo not have\nany material pending litigation or regulatory matters affecting\nus.\nFailures to comply with the fair lending laws, CFPB regulati\nons or the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, could\nadversely affect us.\nThe Bank is subject to, among other things, the provisions of the Equal Credit Opportunity\nAct, or ECOA, and the Fair\nHousing Act, both of which prohibit discrimination based on race or\ncolor, religion, national origin, sex and familial status\nin any aspect of a consumer, commercial credit or\nresidential real estate transaction. The DOJ and the federal bank\nregulatory agencies have issued an Interagency Policy Statement on Discrimination\nin Lending have provided guidance to\nfinancial institutions to evaluate whether discrimination exists and how the\nagencies will respond to lending discrimination,\nand what steps lenders might take to prevent discriminatory lending practices.\nFailures to comply with ECOA, the Fair\nHousing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations, including CFPB\nregulations, could subject us to enforcement\nactions or litigation, and could have a material adverse effect\non our business financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Bank is also subject to the CRA and periodic CRA examinations. The CRA requires\nus to serve our entire\ncommunities, including low-\nand moderate-income neighborhoods. Our CRA ratings could\nbe adversely affected by actual\nor alleged violations of the fair lending or consumer financial protection\nlaws. Even though we have maintained an\n\u201csatisfactory\u201d CRA rating since 2000, we cannot predict our future CRA ratings.\nViolations of fair lending laws or if our\nCRA rating falls to less than \u201csatisfactory\u201d could adversely affect\nour business, including expansion through branching or\nacquisitions.\nCOVID-19 Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. The\nultimate effects of the pandemic on us will depend on the severity,\nscope and duration of the pandemic, its cumulative\neconomic effects, governmental actions in response\nto the pandemic, and the restoration of a more\nnormal economy.\nThe COVID-19 national health emergency has significantly disrupted\nthe United States and international economies and\nfinancial markets. We\nexpect that the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects\nwill continue to adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition and results of operations in future periods. The spread of COVID-19\nhas caused illness, quarantines,\ncancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reductions in business\nactivity and financial transactions,\nsupply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability.\nThe State of Alabama and many other\nstates have taken preventative and protective actions, such as imposing a statewide\nmask mandate, restrictions on travel,\nbusiness operations, public gatherings, social distancing, advising or requiring\nindividuals to limit or forego their time\noutside of their homes, and ordering temporary closures of non-essential businesses.\nThough various of these measures\nhave been relaxed or eliminated, the pandemic has moved in disruptive and unpredictable\nwaves.\nThe travel, hospitality and food and beverage industries, restaurants, retailers and auto\nmanufacturers, and their suppliers\nhave been severely affected. A significant number of layoffs,\nfurloughs of employees, as well as remote work have\noccurred in these and other industries, including government offices, schools and\nuniversities. Auburn University held\nvirtual classes only from March 16, 2020 through the summer session.\nThe auto industry\u2019s production\nand sales continue to\nbe adversely affected\nby supply chain disruptions.\nHyundai and Kia are major direct and indirect employers in our area.\nThe ultimate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy,\ngenerally, our markets, and on us cannot\nbe predicted.\nThe timing and effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results\nof operations and financial condition may\ninclude, among various other consequences, the following. These effects\ndepend on the severity, scope\nand duration of the\npandemic, its cumulative economic effects, and the effectiveness\nof healthcare, business and governmental actions\naddressing the pandemic\u2019s effects,\nincluding vaccinations.\n\u2022\nEmployees\u2019 health could be adversely affected, necessitating their recovery\naway from work;\n\u2022\nUnavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities;\n\u2022\nOur operating effectiveness may be reduced as our employees\nwork from home or suffer from the COVID-19\nvirus;\n\u2022\nShelter in place, remote work or other restrictions and interruptions of our business and contact\nwith our\ncustomers;\n\u2022\nSustained closures of our branch lobbies or the offices of our customers;\n\u2022\nDeclines in demand for loans and other banking services and products, and reduced usage\nand interchange fees\non our payment cards;\n\u2022\nContinuing large scale fiscal and monetary stimulus actions\nmay stabilize the economy, but\nmay increase\neconomic and market risks, including valuation \u201cbubbles,\u201d volatility in various assets and\ninflation;\n\u2022\nInflation and increases in interest rates may result from fiscal stimulus and\nmonetary stimulus, and the Federal\nReserve has indicated it is willing to permit inflation to run moderately above its 2% target\nfor some time, but is\nconsidering raising interest rates and reducing its securities holdings as a result of inflation\nthat is substantially\nhigher than the Federal\nReserve\u2019s target range;\n\u2022\nIncreased savings and debt reduction by consumers could reduce demand for credit\nand our earning assets;\n\u2022\nSignificant volatility in United States financial markets and our investment securities\nportfolio, including credit\nconcerns in municipal securities;\n\u2022\nDeclines in the credit quality of our loan portfolio, owing to the effects\nof the COVID-19 pandemic in the\nmarkets we serve, leading to increased provisions for loan losses and increases in our allowance\nfor possible\ncredit losses;\n\u2022\nDeclines in the value of collateral for loans, including real estate collateral, especially in industries\nsuch as\ntravel, hospitality, restaurants\nand retailers;\n\u2022\nDeclines in the net worth and liquidity of borrowers, impairing their ability to pay timely their\nloan obligations\nto us;\n\u2022\nGenerally low market interest rates that reduce our net interest income and our profitability;\n\u2022\nLoan deferrals and loan modifications, and mortgage foreclosure\nmoratoria, including those mandated by law,\nor\nwhich are encouraged by our regulators, may increase our expense and risks of collectability,\nreduce our cash\nflows and liquidity and adversely affect our results of operations and\nfinancial condition;\n\u2022\nThe end of temporary regulatory accounting and capital relief for banks regarding the effects\nof the COVID-19\npandemic, including loan deferrals and modifications, could increase our TDRs and require\nadditions to our\nallowance for loan losses, which may adversely affect our income,\nfinancial condition and capital;\n\u2022\nOur waiver of various fees and service charges to support our customers\nand communities will adversely affect\nour results of operation and our liquidity and financial position;\n\u2022\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may change customer financial behaviors and\npayment practices. Electronic banking\ncould become more popular with less customers doing business at our offices;\n\u2022\nCertain of our assets, including loans and securities, may become impaired,\nwhich would adversely affect our\nresults of operation and financial condition and mortgage loan foreclosure\nmoratoria may limit our ability to\ntimely act to protect our interests in the loan collateral;\n\u2022\nReductions in income or losses will adversely affect our capital and growth\nof capital, including our capital for\nbank regulatory purposes;\n\u2022\nLosses or reductions in net income may adversely affect the growth or\namount of dividends we can pay on our\ncommon stock;\n\u2022\nThe effects of government fiscal and monetary policies, including\nchanges in such policies, or the effects of\nCOVID-19 relief programs are discontinued, on the economy and financial stability,\ngenerally, and on our\nbusiness, results of operations and financial condition cannot be predicted;\n\u2022\nCybercriminals may increase their attempts to compromise business and consumer\nemails, including an increase\nin phishing attempts, and fraudulent vendors or other parties may view the pandemic\nas an opportunity to prey\nupon consumers and businesses during this time.\n\u2022\nThe restoration of financial stability and economic growth may depend\non the health care system developing and\ndeploying COVID-19 testing and contact tracing, and delivery of COVID-19 vaccines,\nwhich promote consumer\nand employee health and confidence in the economy.\nThese factors, together or in combination with other events or occurrences that are unknown\nor anticipated, may materially\nand adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur stock price may reflect securities market conditions\nThe ongoing COVID-19\npandemic has resulted in substantial securities market volatility,\nespecially for bank stocks and\nhas, and may continue to, adversely affect the market of our common\nstock. The spread, intensification and duration of\nCOVID-19 pandemic, as well as the effectiveness of governmental,\nfiscal and monetary policies, and regulatory responses\nto the pandemic, further affect the financial markets and the market prices\nfor securities generally, and the\nmarket prices for\nbank stocks, including our common stock.\nThe stock market\u2019s gains due to a concentration\nof high growth companies has\nbeen adversely affected by inflation and expectation of higher interest rates and\nthe Russia invasion of Ukraine in February\n2022.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic could result in\ndeterioration of asset quality and an increase in credit\nlosses.\nMany businesses have had, and may continue to have lower revenues and cash\nflows and many consumers will have lower\nincome as a result of COVID-19. These could result in an inability to repay loans timely in\nfull, reduce our asset quality and\nreduce our deposits. Loan modifications and payment deferrals may also increase\nour credit risks, especially when\ntemporary regulatory relief for these actions expires. Our business, results of operations, liquidity\nand financial condition\ncould be adversely affected.\nAs a participating lender in the PPP,\nthe Bank is subject to additional risks of litigation from the\nBank\u2019s\ncustomers or other\nparties regarding\nthe Bank\u2019s\nprocessing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may\nnot fund some or all PPP loan\nguaranties.\nThe CARES Act, Paycheck Protection Program and Healthcare Enhancement\nAct and Economic Aid Act appropriated\nmore than $1 trillion in funding for PPP loans administered through by the SBA and\nthe U.S. Department of the Treasury.\nUnder the PPP,\neligible small businesses and other entities and individuals can apply for loans from existing\nSBA lenders\nand other approved PPP lenders, subject to numerous limitations and eligibility\ncriteria. The Bank is participating as a\nlender in the PPP and made a total of $56.7 million of PPP loans in 2020 and 2021.\nThe PPP loans charge 1% interest\nannually.\nForgiveness of these loans has been slow,\nand PPP loans earn less than market rates.\nSince the opening of the\nPPP,\nvarious banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures used in processing applications\nfor\nthe PPP,\nand greater governmental attention is directed at preventing fraud.\nWe may be exposed\nto similar litigation risks,\nfrom both customers and non-customers that approached the Bank regarding PPP\nloans we extended. If any such litigation\nis filed against the Bank and is not resolved favorably to the Bank, it may result in financial\nliability or adversely affect our\nreputation. Litigation can be costly, regardless\nof outcome. Any financial liability,\nlitigation costs or reputational damage\ncaused by PPP related litigation could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nThe Bank also has credit risk on PPP loans, if the SBA determines deficiencies\nin the manner in which PPP loans were\noriginated, funded or serviced by the Bank, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to\nreceive a PPP loan, or\nobtain forgiveness of a PPP properly,\nincluding those related to the ambiguities in the laws, rules and guidance\nregarding\nthe PPP\u2019s operation. In the event of a loss resulting\nfrom a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there\nwere one or more deficiencies in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated,\nfunded, or serviced by the Company,\nthe SBA may deny its liability under the PPP loan guaranty,\nreduce the amount of the guaranty, or,\nif it has already paid\nunder the guaranty, seek recovery of any\nloss related to the deficiency from the Company.\nSimilar issues may also result in\nthe denial of forgiveness of PPP loans, which could expose us to potential borrower\nbankruptcies and potential losses and\nadditional costs.\nAt December 31, 2021 we had $8.1 million PPP loans outstanding and had not realized\nany losses on such loans.", "PERMNO": 82251, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "AUBN"}
