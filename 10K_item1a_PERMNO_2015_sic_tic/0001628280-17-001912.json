{"cik": "1166003", "company": "XPO Logistics, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-28", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following are important factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations, including those expressed in any forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our other filings with the SEC or in oral presentations such as telephone conferences and webcasts open to the public. You should carefully consider the following factors and consider these in conjunction with \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in Item 8.\nEconomic recessions and other factors that reduce freight volumes, both in North America and Europe, could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe transportation industry in North America and Europe historically has experienced cyclical fluctuations in financial results due to economic recession, downturns in the business cycles of our customers, increases in the prices charged by third-party carriers, interest rate fluctuations and other U.S. and global economic factors beyond our control. During economic downturns, reduced overall demand for transportation services will likely reduce demand for our services and exert downward pressures on our rates and margins. In periods of strong economic growth, demand for limited transportation resources can result in increased network congestion and operating inefficiencies. In addition, any deterioration in the economic environment subjects our business to various risks that may have a material impact on our operating results and future prospects. These risks may include the following:\n\u2022\nA reduction in overall freight volumes reduces our opportunities for growth. In addition, if a downturn in our customers\u2019 business cycles causes a reduction in the volume of freight shipped by those customers, our operating results could be adversely affected.\n\u2022\nSome of our customers may face economic difficulties and may not be able to pay us, and some may go out of business. In addition, some customers may not pay us as quickly as they have in the past, causing our working capital needs to increase.\n\u2022\nA significant number of our transportation providers may go out of business and we may be unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to appropriately adjust our expenses to changing market demands. In order to maintain high variability in our business model, it is necessary to adjust staffing levels to changing market demands. In periods of rapid change, it is more difficult to match our staffing levels to our business needs. In addition, we have other primarily variable expenses that are fixed for a period of time and certain significant fixed expenses, and we may not be able to adequately adjust them in a period of rapid change in market demand.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and, if we are unable to adequately address factors that may adversely affect our revenue and costs, our business could suffer.\nCompetition in the transportation services industry is intense. Increased competition may lead to a reduction in revenues, reduced profit margins, or a loss of market share, any one of which could harm our business. There are many factors that could impair our profitability, including the following:\n\u2022\nCompetition from other transportation services companies, some of which offer different services or have a broader coverage network, more fully developed information technology systems and greater capital resources than we do.\n\u2022\nA reduction in the rates charged by our competitors to gain business, especially during times of declining economic growth. Such reductions may limit our ability to maintain or increase our rates, maintain our operating margins or achieve significant growth in our business.\n\u2022\nShippers soliciting bids from multiple transportation providers for their shipping needs, which may result in the depression of freight rates or loss of business to competitors.\n\u2022\nThe establishment by our competitors of cooperative relationships to increase their ability to address shipper needs.\n\u2022\nOur current or prospective customers may decide to develop or expand internal capabilities for some of the services that we provide.\n\u2022\nThe development of new technologies or business models, which could result in our disintermediation in certain businesses, such as freight brokerage.\nOur profitability may be materially adversely impacted if our investments in equipment, service centers and warehouses do not match customer demand for these resources or if there is a decline in the availability of funding sources for these investments.\nOur LTL and full truckload operations require significant investments in equipment and freight service centers. The amount and timing of our capital investments depend on various factors, including anticipated freight volume levels and the price and availability of appropriate property for service centers and newly-manufactured tractors. If our anticipated service center and/or fleet requirements differ materially from actual usage, our capital-intensive business units, specifically LTL and full truckload, may have too much or too little capacity. We attempt to mitigate the risk associated with too much or too little capacity by adjusting our capital expenditures and by utilizing short-term equipment rentals and sub-contracted operators in order to match capacity with business volumes. Our investments in equipment and service centers depend on our ability to generate cash flow from operations and our access to credit, debt and equity capital markets. A decline in the availability of these funding sources could adversely affect us.\nOur contract logistics operations can require a significant commitment of capital in the form of shelving, racking and other warehousing systems that may be required to implement warehouse-management services for our customers. In the event that we are not able to fully amortize the associated cost of capital across the term of the related customer agreement, or to the extent that the customer defaults on its obligations under the agreement, we could be forced to take a significant loss on the unrecovered portion of this capital cost.\nAnticipated synergies from any acquisitions that we have undertaken may not materialize in the expected timeframe or at all.\nOur 2017 and mid-term financial targets are dependent on our ability to realize significant ongoing synergies with respect to our acquisitions, in particular the Norbert Dentressangle SA (\u201cND\u201d) and Con-way Inc. (\u201cCon-way\u201d) acquisitions we completed in 2015. We may not realize all synergies we anticipate from the acquisitions we undertook. Among the synergies that we currently expect are cross-selling opportunities to our existing customers, network synergies and other operational synergies. Our estimated synergies from the acquisitions that we have undertaken are subject to a number of assumptions about the timing, execution and costs associated with realizing such synergies. Such assumptions are inherently uncertain and are subject to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competition risks and uncertainties. There can be no assurance that such assumptions turn out to be correct and, as a result, the amount of synergies that we will actually realize and/or the timing of any such realization may differ significantly (and may be significantly lower) from the ones that we currently estimate and we may incur significant costs in reaching the estimated synergies.\nWe may not successfully manage our growth.\nWe have grown rapidly and substantially over prior years, including by expanding our internal resources, making acquisitions, in particular in 2015, and entering into new markets, and we intend to continue to focus on rapid growth, primarily organically in 2017. We may experience difficulties and higher-than-expected expenses in executing this strategy as a result of unfamiliarity with new markets, changes in revenue and business models and entering into new geographic areas.\nOur growth will place a significant strain on our management, operational and financial resources. We will need to continually improve existing procedures and controls as well as implement new transaction processing, operational and financial systems,\nand procedures and controls to expand, train and manage our employee base. Our working capital needs will continue to increase as our operations grow. Failure to manage our growth effectively, or obtain necessary working capital, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, stock price and financial condition.\nOur business will be seriously harmed if we fail to develop, implement, maintain, upgrade, enhance, protect and integrate our information technology systems.\nWe rely heavily on our information technology systems to efficiently run our business, and they are a key component of our growth strategy. In general, we expect our customers to continue to demand more sophisticated, fully integrated information systems from their transportation providers. To keep pace with changing technologies and customer demands, we must correctly interpret and address market trends and enhance the features and functionality of our proprietary technology platform in response to these trends. This process of continuous enhancement may lead to significant ongoing software development costs. In addition, we may fail to accurately determine the needs of our customers or the trends in the transportation services industry or we may fail to design and implement the appropriate responsive features and functionality for our technology platform in a timely and cost-effective manner. Any such failures could result in decreased demand for our services and a corresponding decrease in our revenues.\nDespite testing, external and internal risks, such as malware, insecure coding, \u201cActs of God,\u201d data leakage and human error pose a direct threat to the stability or effectiveness of our information technology systems and operations. We may also be subject to cybersecurity attacks and other intentional hacking. Any failure to identify and address such defects or errors or prevent a cyber-attack could result in service interruptions, operational difficulties, loss of revenues or market share, liability to our customers or others, the diversion of corporate resources, injury to our reputation and increased service and maintenance costs. Addressing such issues could prove to be impossible or very costly and responding to resulting claims or liability could similarly involve substantial cost. In addition, recently, there has also been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus on data protection in the U.S. and abroad (particularly in the European Union), and failure to comply with applicable U.S. or foreign data protection regulations or other data protection standards may expose us to litigation, fines, sanctions or other penalties, which could harm our reputation and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe must maintain and enhance the reliability and speed of our information technology systems to remain competitive and effectively handle higher volumes of freight through our network and the various service modes we offer. If our information technology systems are unable to manage additional volume for our operations as our business grows, or if such systems are not suited to manage the various service modes we offer, our service levels and operating efficiency could decline. In addition, if we fail to hire and retain qualified personnel to implement, protect and maintain our information technology systems or if we fail to upgrade our systems to meet our customers\u2019 demands, our business and results of operations could be seriously harmed. This could result in a loss of customers or a decline in the volume of freight we receive from customers.\nWe are developing proprietary information technology for all of our business segments. Our technology may not be successful or may not achieve the desired results and we may require additional training or different personnel to successfully implement this technology. Our technology development process may be subject to cost overruns or delays in obtaining the expected results, which may result in disruptions to our operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe have substantial outstanding indebtedness, which could:\n\u2022\nnegatively affect our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt or dividends on our Series A Preferred Stock;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to fund future capital expenditures and working capital, to engage in future acquisitions or development activities, or to otherwise realize the value of our assets and opportunities fully because of the need to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments of interest and principal or to comply with any restrictive terms of our debt;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nimpair our ability to obtain additional financing or to refinance our indebtedness in the future; and\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that may have proportionately less debt.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, could materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Further, failure to comply with the covenants under our indebtedness may have a material adverse impact on our operations. If we fail to comply with the covenants under any of our indebtedness, and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, such failure may result in an event of default under our indebtedness. We may not have sufficient liquidity to repay or refinance our indebtedness if such indebtedness were accelerated upon an event of default.\nUnder the terms of our outstanding indebtedness, we may not be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, which could further exacerbate the risks described above.\nThe execution of our strategy could depend on our ability to raise capital in the future, and our inability to do so could prevent us from achieving our growth objectives.\nWe may in the future be required to raise capital through public or private financing or other arrangements in order to pursue our growth strategy or operate our businesses. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business or ability to execute our strategy. Further debt financing may involve restrictive covenants and could reduce our profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures.\nWe depend on third-parties in the operation of our business.\nIn our global forwarding, last mile and freight brokerage operations, we do not own or control the transportation assets that deliver our customers\u2019 freight, and we do not employ the people directly involved in delivering this freight. In addition, in our freight brokerage businesses (particularly our last mile delivery logistics operations, our over-the-road expedite operations and our intermodal drayage operations), we engage independent contractors who own and operate their own equipment. Accordingly, we are dependent on third-parties to provide truck, rail, ocean, air and other transportation services and to report certain events to us, including delivery information and cargo claims. This reliance on third-parties could cause delays in reporting certain events, including our ability to recognize revenue and claims in a timely manner.\nOur inability to maintain positive relationships with independent transportation providers could significantly limit our ability to serve our customers on competitive terms. If we are unable to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers or provide our services on competitive terms, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected and our customers could shift their business to our competitors temporarily or permanently. Our ability to secure sufficient equipment or other transportation services to meet our commitments to our customers or provide our services on competitive terms is subject to inherent risks, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nEquipment shortages in the transportation industry, particularly among contracted truckload carriers and railroads;\n\u2022\nInterruptions in service or stoppages in transportation as a result of labor disputes, seaport strikes, network congestion, weather-related issues, \u201cActs of God,\u201d or acts of terrorism;\n\u2022\nChanges in regulations impacting transportation;\n\u2022\nIncreases in operating expenses for carriers, such as fuel costs, insurance premiums and licensing expenses, that result in a reduction in available carriers; and\n\u2022\nChanges in transportation rates.\nIncreases in driver compensation and difficulties attracting and retaining drivers could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nOur LTL and full truckload operations are conducted primarily with employee drivers. Recently, there has been intense competition for qualified drivers in the transportation industry due to a shortage of drivers. The availability of qualified drivers may be affected from time to time by changing workforce demographics, competition from other transportation companies and industries for employees, the availability and affordability of driver training schools, changing industry regulations, and the demand for drivers in the labor market. If the industry-wide shortage of qualified drivers continues, these business lines will likely continue to experience difficulty in attracting and retaining enough qualified drivers to fully satisfy customer demands. As a result of the current highly-competitive labor market for drivers, our LTL and full truckload operations may be required to increase driver compensation and benefits in the future, or face difficulty meeting customer demands, all of which could adversely affect our profitability. Additionally, a shortage of drivers could result in the underutilization of our truck fleet, lost revenue, increased costs for purchased transportation or increased costs for driver recruitment.\nIncreases in independent contractor driver compensation or other difficulties attracting and retaining qualified independent contractor drivers could adversely affect our profitability and ability to maintain or grow our independent contractor driver fleet.\nOur freight brokerage business operate through fleets of vehicles that are owned and operated by independent contractors. Our last mile business also operates through a fleet of independent contract carriers that supply their own vehicles, drivers and helpers. These independent contractors are responsible for maintaining and operating their own equipment and paying their own fuel, insurance, licenses and other operating costs. Turnover and bankruptcy among independent contractor drivers often limit the pool of qualified independent contractor drivers and increase competition for their services. In addition, regulations such as the FMCSA Compliance Safety Accountability program may further reduce the pool of qualified independent contractor\ndrivers. Thus, our continued reliance on independent contractor drivers could limit our ability to grow our ground transportation fleet.\nWe are currently experiencing, and expect to continue to experience from time to time in the future, difficulty in attracting and retaining sufficient numbers of qualified independent contractor drivers. Additionally, our agreements with independent contractor drivers are terminable by either party upon short notice and without penalty. Consequently, we regularly need to recruit new qualified independent contractor drivers to replace those who have left our fleet. If we are unable to retain our existing independent contractor drivers or recruit new independent contractor drivers, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe compensation we offer our independent contractor drivers is subject to market conditions and we may find it necessary to continue to increase independent contractor drivers\u2019 compensation in future periods. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain a sufficient number of independent contractor drivers, we could be required to increase our mileage rates and accessorial pay or operate with fewer trucks and face difficulty meeting shipper demands, all of which would adversely affect our profitability and ability to maintain our size or to pursue our growth strategy.\nOur business may be materially adversely affected by labor disputes.\nOur business in the past has been and in the future could be adversely affected by strikes and labor renegotiations affecting seaports, labor disputes between railroads and their union employees, or by a work stoppage at one or more railroads or local trucking companies servicing rail or port terminals, including work disruptions involving owner operators under contract with our local trucking operations. Port shutdowns and similar disruptions to major points in national or international transportation networks, most of which are beyond our control, could result in terminal embargoes, disrupt equipment and freight flows, depress volumes and revenues, increase costs and have other negative effects on our operations and financial results.\nLabor disputes involving our customers could affect our operations. If our customers are unable to negotiate new labor contracts and our clients\u2019 plants experience slowdowns or closures as a result, our revenue and profitability could be negatively impacted. In particular, our Logistics segment derives a substantial portion of its revenue from the operation and management of operating facilities, which are often located in close proximity to a client\u2019s manufacturing plant and are integrated into the client\u2019s production line process. We may experience significant revenue loss and shut-down costs, including costs related to early termination of leases, causing our business to suffer if clients suffer strikes or other labor disputes, close their plants or significantly modify their capacity or supply chains at a plant that our Logistics segment services.\nXPO Logistics Europe\u2019s business activities require a significant amount of labor, which represents one of its most significant costs, and it is essential that we maintain good relations with employees, trade unions and other staff representative institutions. A deteriorating economic environment may result in tensions in industrial relations, which may lead to industrial action within our European operations that could have a direct impact on customer services. Generally, any deterioration in industrial relations in our European operations could have an adverse effect on our revenues, earnings, financial position, and outlook.\nEfforts by labor organizations to organize employees at certain locations in North America, if successful, may result in increased costs and decreased efficiencies at those locations.\nSince 2014, in the United States, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (\u201cTeamsters\u201d) has attempted to organize employees at several LTL locations and one supply chain location that have become part of the Company\u2019s operations through acquisitions. Additionally, the International Association of Machinists (\u201cMachinists\u201d) has attempted to organize a small number of mechanics at two LTL maintenance shops. The majority of employees involved in those organizing efforts rejected union representation. As of January 31, 2017, approximately 124 employees at two LTL locations and approximately 125 employees at one supply chain location have voted for Teamsters representation, and the results of those three elections have been certified by the National Labor Relations Board. At one LTL location, the parties have been in negotiations for an initial contract since February 2015. At the remaining locations, the parties will soon start negotiations. In addition, as of January 31, 2017, an aggregate of approximately 225 employees at three additional LTL locations voted for Teamsters representation, and approximately 11 employees at one LTL location voted for Machinists representation. We are contesting the results of these four elections. We cannot predict with certainty whether further organizing efforts may result in the unionization of any additional locations domestically. If successful, these efforts may result in increased costs and decreased efficiencies at the specific locations where representation is elected. We do not expect the impact, if any, to extend to our larger organization or the service of our customer base.\nCertain of our businesses rely on owner-operators and contract carriers to conduct their operations, and the status of these parties as independent contractors, rather than employees, is being challenged.\nWe are involved in numerous lawsuits, including putative class action lawsuits, multi-plaintiff and individual lawsuits, and state tax and other administrative proceedings that claim that our contract carriers or owner-operators or their drivers should be treated as our employees, rather than independent contractors, or that certain of our drivers were not paid for all compensable\ntime or were not provided with required meal or rest breaks. These lawsuits and proceedings may seek substantial monetary damages (including claims for unpaid wages, overtime, failure to provide meal and rest periods, unreimbursed business expenses and other items), injunctive relief, or both. In addition, we incur certain costs, including legal fees, in defending the status of these parties as independent contractors.\nWhile we believe that our contract carriers and owner-operators and their drivers are properly classified as independent contractors rather than as employees, adverse decisions have been rendered recently in certain cases pending against us, including with respect to class certification of certain contract carriers and determinations that certain of our contract carriers and owner-operators are improperly classified. Certain of these decisions are subject to appeal, but we cannot provide assurance that we will determine to pursue any appeal or that any such appeal will be successful. Adverse final outcomes in these matters could, among other things, entitle certain of our contract carriers and owner-operators and their drivers to reimbursement with respect to certain expenses and to the benefit of wage-and-hour laws and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for us, and could result in changes to the independent contractor status of our contract carriers and owner-operators. Changes to state laws governing the definition of independent contractors could also impact the status of our contract carriers and owner-operators. Adverse final outcomes in these matters or changes to state laws could cause us to change our business model, which could have a material adverse effect on our business strategies, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. These claims involve potentially significant classes that could involve thousands of claimants and, accordingly, significant potential damages and litigation costs, and could lead others to bring similar claims.\nThe results of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters, or our failure to recover, in full or in part, under the indemnity provisions noted above, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur overseas operations subject us to various operational and financial risks which could adversely affect our business.\nThe services we provide outside of the United States subject us to risks resulting from changes in tariffs, trade restrictions, trade agreements, tax policies, difficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations and agents, different liability standards, issues related to compliance with anti-corruption laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, data protection, trade compliance, and intellectual property laws of countries which do not protect our rights in our intellectual property, including our proprietary information systems, to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region and/or decrease the profitability of our operations in that region. As we expand our business in foreign countries, we will also be exposed to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls.\nOur European business heavily relies on subcontracting and we use a large number of temporary employees in these operations. Any failure to properly manage our subcontractors or temporary employees in Europe could have a material adverse impact on XPO Logistics Europe\u2019s revenues, earnings, financial position and outlook.\nWe operate in Europe through our majority-owned subsidiary, XPO Logistics Europe SA. Subcontracting plays a key role in our European operations and we subcontract approximately 40% of our transport operations in the region. As a result, we are exposed to various risks related to managing our subcontractors, such as the risk that they do not fulfill their assignments in a satisfactory manner or within the specified deadlines. Such failures could compromise our ability to fulfill our commitments to our customers, comply with applicable regulations or otherwise meet our customers\u2019 expectations. In some situations, the poor execution of services by our subcontractors could result in a customer terminating a contract. Such failures by our subcontractors could harm our reputation and ability to win new business and could lead to our being liable for contractual damages. Furthermore, in the event of a failure by our subcontractors to fulfill their assignments in a satisfactory manner, we could be required to perform unplanned work or additional services in line with the contracted service, without receiving any additional compensation. Lastly, some of our subcontractors in Europe may not be insured, or may not have sufficient resources available to handle any claims from customers resulting from potential damage and losses relating to their performance of services on our behalf. As a result, the non-compliance by our subcontractors with their contractual or legal obligations may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nXPO Logistics Europe also makes significant use of temporary staff. We cannot guarantee that temporary employees are as well-trained as our other employees. Specifically, we may be exposed to the risk that temporary employees may not perform their assignments in a satisfactory manner or may not comply with our safety rules in an appropriate manner, whether as a result of their lack of experience or otherwise. If such risks materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe are involved in multiple lawsuits and are subject to various claims that could result in significant expenditures and impact our operations.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various types of claims and litigation. In addition to the matters described in the risk factor \u201cCertain of our businesses rely on owner-operators and contract carriers to conduct their operations,\nand the status of these parties as independent contractors, rather than employees, is being challenged,\u201d we are subject to claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, traffic accidents, cargo and other property damage, business practices, environmental liability and other matters, including with respect to claims asserted under various theories of agency and employer liability notwithstanding our independent contractor relationships with our transportation providers. Claims against us may exceed the amount of insurance coverage that we have, or may not be covered by insurance at all. Businesses that we acquire also increase our exposure to litigation. A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, liability claims, or workers\u2019 compensation claims, or the unfavorable resolution of claims, or our failure to recover, in full or in part, under indemnity provisions with transportation providers could materially and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability.\nAn increase in the number and/or severity of self-insured claims or an increase in insurance premiums could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe use a combination of self-insurance programs and large-deductible purchased insurance to provide for the costs of employee medical, vehicular, cargo and workers' compensation claims. Our estimated liability for self-retained insurance claims reflects certain actuarial assumptions and judgments, which are subject to a high degree of variability. We periodically evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance levels based on targeted risk tolerance and premium expense. An increase in the number and/or severity of self-insured claims or an increase in insurance premiums could have an adverse effect on us.\nWe expect costs associated with providing benefits under employee medical plans and postretirement medical plans to increase due to health care reform legislation. Changes made to the design of our medical plans have the potential to mitigate some of the cost impact of the provisions included in the legislation. Ultimately, the cost of providing benefits under our medical plans is dependent on a variety of factors, including governmental laws and regulations, health care cost trends, claims experience and health care decisions by plan participants. As a result, we are unable to predict how the cost of providing benefits under medical plans will affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks associated with defined benefit plans for our current and former employees, which could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and financial position.\nFollowing our acquisitions of ND and Con-way, we now maintain defined benefit pension plans and a postretirement medical plan. Our defined benefit pension plans include funded and unfunded plans in the United States and the United Kingdom. A decline in interest rates and/or lower returns on funded plan assets may cause increases in the expense and funding requirements for these defined benefit pension plans and for our postretirement medical plan. Despite past amendments that froze our defined benefit pension plans to new participants and curtailed benefits, these pension plans remain subject to volatility associated with interest rates, inflation, returns on plan assets, other actuarial assumptions and statutory funding requirements. In addition to being subject to volatility associated with interest rates, our postretirement medical plan remains subject to volatility associated with actuarial assumptions and trends in healthcare costs. Any of the aforementioned factors could lead to a significant increase in the expense of these plans and a deterioration in the solvency of these plans, which could significantly increase the Company\u2019s contribution requirements. As a result, we are unable to predict the effect on our financial statements associated with our defined benefit pension plans and our postretirement medical plan.\nBecause of our floating rate credit facilities, we may be adversely affected by interest rate changes.\nBoth the Second Amended and Restated Revolving Loan Credit Agreement (the \u201cABL Facility\u201d) and the senior secured term loan credit agreement (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d) provide for an interest rate based on LIBOR or a Base Rate, as defined in the agreements, plus an applicable margin. Our financial position may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates since the ABL Facility and Term Loan Facility are subject to floating interest rates. Refer to Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for the impact on interest expense of a hypothetical 100-basis-point increase in the interest rate. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. A significant increase in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations because a significant proportion of our assets, liabilities and earnings are denominated in foreign currencies.\nWe present our financial statements in U.S. dollars but we have a significant proportion of our net assets and income in non-U.S. dollar currencies, primarily the euro and pounds sterling (\u201cGBP\u201d). Consequently, a depreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have an adverse impact on our financial results as further discussed below under Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nThe economic uncertainties relating to eurozone monetary policies may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate against other currencies. Currency volatility contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions. For example, in the event that one or more European countries were to replace the euro with another currency, our sales into such\ncountries, or in Europe generally, would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established. Accordingly, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our business and financial condition and the business of the combined company.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s expected exit from the European Union could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFollowing a referendum in June 2016 in which voters in the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) approved an exit from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d), it is expected that the U.K. government will initiate a process to leave the EU (often referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d) and begin negotiating the terms of the U.K.\u2019s future relationship with the EU. The likely exit of the U.K. from the EU will have uncertain impacts on our transportation and logistics operations in Europe. In 2016, we derived approximately 36% of our revenue in Europe, including 12% in the U.K. Any adverse consequences of Brexit, such as a deterioration in the U.K.'s and/or EU's economic condition, currency exchange rates, bilateral trade agreements or regulation of trade, including the potential imposition of tariffs, could reduce demand for our services in the U.K. and/or the EU, or otherwise have a negative impact on our operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our growth strategy through acquisitions.\nWe may continue to expand through acquisitions to take advantage of market opportunities we perceive in the transportation and logistics markets, as well as new markets that we may enter. However, if we choose to make acquisitions in the future, we may experience delays or be unable to make the acquisitions we desire for a number of reasons. Suitable acquisition candidates may not be available at purchase prices that are attractive to us or on terms that are acceptable to us. In pursuing acquisition opportunities, we will compete with other companies, some of which have greater financial and other resources than we do.\nWe are unable to predict the size, timing and number of acquisitions we may complete. In addition, we may incur expenses associated with sourcing, evaluating and negotiating acquisitions (including those that are not completed), and we also may pay fees and expenses associated with obtaining financing for acquisitions and with investment banks and others finding acquisitions for us. Any of these amounts may be substantial, and together with the size, timing and number of acquisitions we pursue, may negatively impact us and cause significant volatility in our financial results.\nSales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe may fund any future acquisitions or our capital requirements from time to time, in whole or part, through sales or issuances of our common stock or equity-based securities, subject to prevailing market conditions and our financing needs. Future equity financing will dilute the interests of our then-existing stockholders, and future sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity-related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe do not own, and may not acquire, all of the outstanding shares of XPO Logistics Europe SA, the majority-owned subsidiary through which we conduct our European operations.\nWe currently own 86.25% of the outstanding shares of XPO Logistics Europe, the majority-owned subsidiary through which we conduct our European operations. We may not acquire the remaining shares of XPO Logistics Europe. French law only permits \u201csqueeze out\u201d mergers when a holder owns more than 95% of the outstanding shares. If we do not wholly-own XPO Logistics Europe, we will not have access to all of its cash flow to service our debt, as we will only receive a prorated portion of any dividend based on our ownership percentage. In addition, we will be subject to limitations on our ability to enter into transactions with XPO Logistics Europe that are not on arms-length terms, which could limit synergies that we could otherwise achieve between our North American and European operations. We also may not be able to consolidate XPO Logistics Europe for tax purposes, and XPO Logistics Europe would be forced to continue as a listed public company in France, thereby incurring certain recurring costs.\nVolatility in fuel prices impacts our fuel surcharge revenues and may impact our profitability.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the availability and price of fuel, which are subject to political, economic and market factors that are outside of our control.\nFuel expense constitutes one of the greatest costs to our LTL and full truckload carrier operations, as well as to our fleet of independent contractor drivers and third-party transportation providers who complete the physical movement of freight arranged by our other business operations. Accordingly, we may be adversely affected by the timing and degree of fluctuations and volatility in fuel prices. As is customary in our industry, most of our customer contracts include fuel-surcharge revenue programs or cost-recovery mechanisms to mitigate the effect of the fuel price increase over base amounts established in the contract. However, these fuel surcharge mechanisms may not capture the entire amount of the increase in fuel prices, and they also feature a lag between the payment for fuel and collection of the surcharge revenue. Market pressures may limit our ability to assess fuel surcharges in the future. The extent to which we are able to recover in full for fuel cost changes may also vary\ndepending on the degree to which we are not compensated due to empty and out-of-route miles or from engine idling during cold or warm weather.\nDecreases in fuel prices reduce the cost of transportation services and accordingly, will reduce our revenues and may reduce margins for certain lines of business. Significant changes in the price or availability of fuel in future periods, or significant changes in our ability to mitigate fuel price increases through the use of fuel surcharges, could have a material adverse impact on our operations, fleet capacity and ability to generate both revenues and profits.\nIssues related to the intellectual property rights on which our business depends, whether related to our failure to enforce our own rights or infringement claims brought by others, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use both internally developed and purchased technology in conducting our business. Whether internally developed or purchased, it is possible that the user of these technologies could be claimed to infringe upon or violate the intellectual property rights of third parties. In the event that a claim is made against us by a third party for the infringement of intellectual property rights, any settlement or adverse judgment against us either in the form of increased costs of licensing or a cease and desist order in using the technology could have an adverse effect on us and our results of operation.\nWe also rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including copyrights, trademarks, domain names, trade secrets, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights, to establish and protect our intellectual property and technology. Any of our owned or licensed intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated; our trade secrets and other confidential information could be disclosed in an unauthorized manner to third-parties or we may fail to secure the rights to intellectual property developed by our employees, contractors and others. Efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be time consuming and costly, distract management\u2019s attention and resources and ultimately be unsuccessful. Moreover, our failure to develop and properly manage new intellectual property could adversely affect our market positions and business opportunities.\nOur failure to obtain, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to regulation, which could negatively impact our business.\nOur operations are regulated and licensed by various governmental agencies in the United States and in foreign countries in which we operate. These regulatory agencies have authority and oversight of domestic and international transportation services and related activities, licensure, motor carrier operations, safety and security and other matters. We must comply with various insurance and surety bond requirements to act in the capacities for which we are licensed. Our subsidiaries and independent contractors must also comply with applicable regulations and requirements of various agencies. Through our subsidiaries and business units, we hold various licenses required to carry out our domestic and international services. These licenses permit us to provide services as a motor carrier, property broker, indirect air carrier, OTI, NVOCC, freight forwarder, air freight forwarder, and ocean freight forwarder. We also are subject to regulations and requirements promulgated by, among others, the DOT, FMCSA, DHS, CBP, TSA, FMC, IATA, the Canada Border Services Agency and various other international, domestic, state, and local agencies and port authorities. Certain of our businesses engage in the transportation of hazardous materials, which subjects us to regulations with respect to transportation of such materials and environmental regulations in the case of any accidents that occur during the transportation of materials and result in discharge of such materials. Our failure to maintain our required licenses, or to comply with applicable regulations, could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. See the \u201cRegulation\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the caption entitled \u201cBusiness\u201d for more information.\nFuture laws and regulations may be more stringent and require changes in our operating practices that influence the demand for transportation services or require us to incur significant additional costs. We are unable to predict the impact that recently enacted and future regulations may have on our businesses. Higher costs incurred by us, or incurred by our independent contractors or third-party transportation providers who pass the increased costs on to us, as a result of future new regulations could adversely affect our results of operations to the extent we are unable to obtain a corresponding increase in price from our customers.\nFailure to comply with trade compliance laws and regulations applicable to our operations may subject us to liability and result in mandatory or voluntary disclosures to government agencies of transactions or dealings involving sanctioned countries, entities or individuals.\nAs a result of our acquisition activities, we acquired companies with business operations outside the U.S., some of which were not previously subject to certain U.S. laws and regulations, including trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d). In the course of implementing our compliance processes with respect to the operations of these acquired companies, we have identified a number of transactions or dealings involving countries and entities that are subject to U.S. economic sanctions. As disclosed in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended\nJune 30, 2016, and September 30, 2016, we filed initial voluntary disclosure of such matters with OFAC in August 2016. We are continuing to investigate and intend to cooperate with regulatory authorities regarding these matters and to file a full report with OFAC when our investigation is complete. As we investigate, we may identify additional transactions or dealings involving sanctioned countries, entities, or individuals. The transactions or dealings that we have identified to date, or other transactions or dealings that we may identify in the future, could result in negative consequences to us, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm.\nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer controls a large portion of our stock and has substantial control over us, which could limit other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence the outcome of key transactions, including changes of control.\nUnder applicable SEC rules, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Bradley S. Jacobs, beneficially owns approximately 15% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2016. This concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with concentrated stockholders. Our preferred stock votes together with our common stock on an \u201cas-converted\u201d basis on all matters, except as otherwise required by law, and separately as a class with respect to certain matters implicating the rights of holders of shares of the preferred stock. Accordingly, Mr. Jacobs can exert substantial influence over our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, including a merger, consolidation, or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if that change of control would benefit our other stockholders. Additionally, significant fluctuations in the levels of ownership of our largest stockholders, including shares beneficially owned by Mr. Jacobs, could impact the volume of trading, liquidity and market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90175, "SIC": 4731, "TIC": "XPO"}
