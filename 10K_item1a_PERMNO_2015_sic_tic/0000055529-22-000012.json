Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risks before you decide to buy shares of our common stock. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, results of operations, or financial condition would likely suffer. In such case, the trading price of our common stock would decline, and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our stock.\nThis and other public reports may contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about us and our industry. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results\ncould differ materially from those forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including those more fully described below and elsewhere in our public reports. We do not undertake to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future.\nDisruptions in the financial markets have historically created, and may continue to create, uncertainty in economic conditions that may adversely affect our customers and our business.\nThe financial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia have in the past been, and may in the future be, volatile. The tightening of credit in financial markets, worsening of economic conditions, a prolonged global, national or regional economic recession or other similar events could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and on our sales, pricing and profitability. We are unable to predict the likely occurrence or duration of these adverse economic conditions and the impact these events may have on our operations and the end users who purchase our products.\nIf we fail to compete effectively, our revenue and profit margins could decline.\nWe face a variety of competition in all of the markets in which we participate. Competitive pricing, including price competition or the introduction of new products, could have material adverse effects on our revenues and profit margins.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends to a significant extent on the specification or approval of our products by architects, engineers, and customers. If a significant segment of those communities were to decide that the design, materials, manufacturing, testing, or quality control of our products is inferior to that of any of our competitors, our sales and profits would be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we lose a large customer, our sales and profits would decline.\nWe have substantial sales to three of our domestic channel partners. The combined sales to two dealers and our national stocking distributor accounted for approximately 38% of our sales in fiscal year 2022. Loss of all or a part of our sales to a large channel partner would have a material effect on our revenues and profits until an alternative channel partner could be developed.\nAn increase in the price of raw materials and energy could negatively affect our sales and profits.\nIt is common in the laboratory and healthcare furniture industries for customers to require delivery at extended future dates, as products are frequently installed in buildings yet to be constructed. Since prices are normally quoted on a firm basis in the industry, we bear the burden of possible increases in labor, material and energy costs between the quotation of an order and the delivery of the products. Our principal raw materials are steel, including stainless steel, wood and epoxy resin. Numerous factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, competition, worldwide demand, labor costs, energy costs, and import duties and other trade restrictions, influence prices for our raw materials. During the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022, prices for two of our principal raw materials, steel and epoxy resin, increased 149% and 162%, respectively. We have not always been able, and in the future we might not be able, to increase our product prices in amounts that correspond to increases in costs of raw materials, without materially and adversely affecting our sales and profits. Where we are not able to increase our prices, increases in our raw material costs will adversely affect our profitability.\nOur future growth may depend on our ability to penetrate new international markets.\nInternational laws and regulations, construction customs, standards, techniques and methods differ from those in the United States. Significant challenges of conducting business in foreign countries include, among other factors, geopolitical tensions, local acceptance of our products, political instability, currency controls, changes in import and export regulations, changes in tariff and freight rates and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nEvents outside our control may affect our operating results.\nWe have little control over the timing of shipping customer orders, as customers' required delivery dates are subject to change by the customer. Construction delays and customer changes to product designs are among the factors that may delay the start of manufacturing and shipments of orders. Shipments that we anticipate in one quarter may occur in another quarter, affecting both quarters' results. Weather conditions, such as unseasonably warm, cold, or wet weather, can also affect and sometimes delay projects. Political and economic events can also affect our revenues. When sales do not meet our expectations, our operating results will be reduced for the relevant quarters.\nOur principal markets are in the laboratory and healthcare building construction industry. This industry is subject to significant volatility due to various factors, none of which is within our control. Declines in construction activity or demand for our products could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe depend on key management and technical personnel, the loss of whom could harm our business.\nWe depend on certain key management and technical personnel. The loss of one or more key employees may materially and adversely affect us. Our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified technical, marketing, and management personnel necessary for the maintenance and expansion of our activities. We might not be able to attract or retain such personnel.\nOur stock price is likely to be volatile and could drop.\nThe trading price of our Common Stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter-to-quarter variation in operating results, announcement of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors, general conditions in the construction and construction materials industries, relatively low trading volume in our common stock and other events or factors. In addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced extreme price fluctuations. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. Securities market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to other risks that might also cause our actual results to vary materially from our forecasts, targets, or projections, including:\n\u2022Failing to anticipate the need for, appropriately invest in and effectively manage the human, information technology and logistical resources necessary to support our business, including managing the costs associated with such resources;\n\u2022Failing to generate sufficient future positive operating cash flows and, if necessary, secure adequate external financing to fund our growth;\n\u2022Interruptions in service by common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels; and\nDisruptions of our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results.\nDisruption of our supply chain capabilities due to trade restrictions, political instability, severe weather, natural disasters, public health crises, war, terrorism, or labor supply could impair our ability to source key components. If we are required to obtain these components from an alternate source, we may not be able to obtain pricing on as favorable terms. Additionally, we may be forced to pay additional transportation costs and/or we may experience a delay in our ability to meet demand for our products. Any of the foregoing disruptions could exacerbate other risk factors and have an adverse effect on operating results and financial condition. During fiscal year 2022, we experienced increases in raw material costs as a result of supply chain disruptions, and we could continue to experience such increases.\nWe recently experienced a network cyber attack that disrupted our domestic operations. Future cybersecurity incidents could expose us to liability and damage our reputation and our business.\nWe collect, process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, and it is critical to our business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure. Our information technology systems are essential to our efforts to manufacture our products, process customer sales transactions, manage inventory levels, conduct business with our suppliers and other business partners, and record, summarize and analyze the results of our operations. These systems contain, among other things, material operational, financial and administrative information related to our business. As with most companies, there will always be some risk of physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, or similar disruptions.\nIn addition, we, like all entities, are the target of cybercriminals who attempt to compromise our systems. From time to time, we experience threats and intrusions that may require remediation to protect sensitive information, including our intellectual property and personal information, and our overall business. Any physical or electronic break-in, computer virus, cybersecurity attack or other security breach or compromise of the information handled by us or our service providers may jeopardize the security or integrity of information in our computer systems and networks or those of our customers and cause significant interruptions in our and our customers' operations.\nAny systems and processes that we have developed that are designed to protect customer, associate and vendor information, and intellectual property, and to prevent data loss and other security attacks, cannot provide absolute security. In addition, we may not successfully implement remediation plans to address all potential exposures. It is possible that we may have to expend additional financial and other resources to address these problems. Failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security incidents could expose us or our customers, associates and vendors to a risk of loss or misuse of such information, cause customers to lose confidence in our data protection measures, damage our reputation, adversely affect our operating results or result in litigation or potential liability for us.\nAs disclosed in our Form 10-Q for the period ended October 31, 2021, on November 5, 2021, the Company experienced a criminal network cyber attack that led to a disruption of our domestic operations, including manufacturing, engineering, administration, and sales operations. By November 15, 2021, we had substantially restored our operations. We engaged third party experts, including a cybersecurity firm, to perform a fulsome forensic investigation of this attack; among other things, the cybersecurity firm assessed whether any confidential or sensitive data had been compromised. Based on the results of the investigation, we do not believe any confidential or sensitive data has been downloaded, stolen from the Company's systems, or otherwise exfiltrated. The Company had insurance coverage against recovery costs and business interruption resulting from cyber attacks. However, the Company incurred expenses and losses in excess of its existing insurance coverage. As of April 30, 2022, the Company no longer had active insurance coverage against potential cyber attacks.\nWhile the Company will seek to obtain insurance for losses related to any similar future events, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be available to the Company. Any future such events, particularly if not covered by insurance, could have material adverse effects on the Company's business and/or results of operations. Additionally, we expect to continue to make investments in our information technology infrastructure. The implementation of these investments may be more costly or take longer than we anticipate, or could otherwise adversely affect our business operations, which could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nInternal Controls Over Financial Reporting.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect material misstatements in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nChanges in U.S. trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences, may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which the U.S. or other countries will impose quotas, duties, tariffs, taxes or other similar restrictions upon the import or export of our products or raw materials in the future, nor can we predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impact on our business. Changes in U.S. trade policy could result in one or more foreign governments adopting responsive trade policies making it more difficult or costly for us to import our products or raw materials from those countries. This, together with tariffs already imposed, or that may be imposed in the future, by the U.S., could require us to increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices, result in lowering our margin on products sold. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the U.S. economy, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe impact of COVID-19 and future pandemics could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nWe are continuing to closely monitor developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its impact on our business; however, due to the wide-ranging and highly uncertain nature of this event, it currently is not possible to estimate the ultimate direct and indirect impact of COVID-19 on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity with reasonable certainty.\nThus far, throughout the pandemic, we believe we have successfully navigated the risks associated with COVID-19 and have been able to successfully maintain our business operations. The extent of the continued impact of COVID-19 on our business and financial results depends on future developments, including the emergence of new and different strains of the virus and the effectiveness of vaccinations and other public health measures. Other pandemics are also possible with similar or worse public health outcomes. The sweeping nature of pandemics makes it extremely difficult to predict how and to what extent our business and operations could be affected in the long run. Our workforce, and the workforce of our vendors, service providers, and counterparties, could be affected by COVID-19, which could result in an adverse impact on our ability to conduct business. We are continuing to take precautions to protect the safety and well-being of our employees while striving to provide uninterrupted services to our customers. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have continued to support our business operations. However, no assurance can be given that these actions will be sufficient, nor can we predict the level of disruption that will occur to our employees' ability to provide customer support and service. In addition, the increase in the number of our employees working remotely has increased certain risks to our business, including increased demand on our information technology resources and systems, greater potential for phishing and other cyber attacks, and an increase in the number of points of potential attack. Any failure to manage these risks effectively and to identify and respond to any cyber attacks on a timely basis may adversely affect our business. New processes, procedures, and controls may be required to respond to any changes in our business\nenvironment. Further, should any key employees become ill from COVID-19 and unable to work, our ability to operate our internal controls may be adversely impacted.\nAdditional factors related to COVID-19 or other major public health issues that could have material and adverse effects on our ability to successfully operate include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022The efforts of governmental and non-governmental organizations in combating the spread and severity of COVID-19 or other major public health issues may not be effective. Further, we cannot predict how legal and regulatory responses to concerns about COVID-19 or other major public health issues will impact our business;\n\u2022A general decline in business activity, especially as it relates to our customers' expansion or consolidation activities;\n\u2022The destabilization of the financial markets, which could negatively impact our customer growth and access to capital, along with our customers' ability to make payments for their purchase orders;\n\u2022Severe disruptions to and instability in the global financial markets, and deterioration in credit and financing conditions, which could affect our access to capital necessary to fund business operations or current investment and growth strategies;\n\u2022A material disruption in our supply chain, which could affect our ability to source products from vendors on a timely basis or on favorable terms.\nSales to customers outside the United States or with international operations expose us to risks inherent in international sales.\nDuring fiscal year 2022, 26% of our revenues were derived from sales outside of the United States. A key element of our growth strategy is to expand our worldwide customer base and our international operations. Operating in international markets requires significant resources and management attention and subjects us to regulatory, economic and political risks that are different from those in the United States. We cannot assure you that our expansion efforts into other international markets will be successful. Our experience in the United States and other international markets in which we already have a presence may not be relevant to our ability to expand in other emerging markets. Our international expansion efforts may not be successful in creating further demand for our products outside of the United States or in effectively selling our products in the international markets we enter.", "PERMNO": 47571, "SIC": 3821, "TIC": "KEQU"}
