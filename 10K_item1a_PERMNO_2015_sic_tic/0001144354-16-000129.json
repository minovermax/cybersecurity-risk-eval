RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the following risks and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings before you decide whether to buy our common stock. If any of the events contemplated by the following discussion of risks should occur, our business, results of operations and financial condition could suffer significantly. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock.\nRisks Relating to the Merger with Global\nThe failure to complete or delays in completing the merger with Global could adversely affect our business and our stock price.\nConsummation of the merger with Global is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by our stockholders. There can be no assurance that these conditions will be satisfactorily met or validly waived, or that the Company and Global will be able to successfully consummate the merger, on the anticipated terms or at all. We will have incurred significant costs, including the diversion of management resources and transaction-related expenses for which we will receive little or no benefit, if the merger is not consummated. The Merger Agreement may be terminated by either party if the merger is not completed on or before June 15, 2016. In addition, the Merger Agreement contains certain other termination rights for both us and Global. A failed transaction may result in negative publicity. Any of these events, individually or in combination, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe pending merger could adversely affect our business, financial results and operations, including our relationships with customers, vendors and employees.\nThe proposed merger with Global could cause material disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding our business. This could affect our relationships with customers, vendors and employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations. In particular, we could lose important personnel if some employees decide to leave in light of the proposed Acquisition. We could potentially lose customers or suppliers, or our customers or suppliers could modify their relationships with us in an adverse manner. In addition, we have devoted-and will continue to devote significant management resources to complete the merger. This may cause our business and operating results to suffer.\nThe Merger Agreement also places restrictions on how we conduct our business before the merger is completed. These restrictions could result in our inability to respond effectively, and in a timely manner, to competitive pressures, industry developments and future opportunities. This could harm our business, financial results and operations. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Agreement and Plan of Merger\u201d for more information about the proposed merger with Global and its impact on our business, including restrictive covenants relating to our operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nUnauthorized disclosure of merchant, cardholder or other user data, whether through breach of our computer systems (such as the Processing System Intrusion discussed in Item 3 Legal Proceedings), cyber-attack or otherwise, could expose us to liability and protracted and costly litigation, as well as harm our reputation.\nWe collect and store sensitive data about merchants, including names, addresses, social security numbers, driver's license numbers and checking account numbers. In addition, we maintain a database of cardholder and other user data relating to specific transactions, including bankcard numbers, in order to process the transactions and for fraud prevention. Any unauthorized use, cyber-attack, unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption, denial of service, corruption of data, or theft of non-public or other sensitive information, similar act by a malevolent party, or inadvertent acts by our own employees, could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, and could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations, or that of our merchants. Additionally, any loss of data by us or our merchants could result in significant fines and sanctions by the card networks or governmental bodies, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial position and/or results of operations. In addition, a significant breach could result in our computer systems being prohibited from processing transactions for card networks.\nOur computer systems have been, and could be in the future, subject to penetration by hackers and our encryption of data may not prevent unauthorized use. In this event, we may be subject to liability, including claims for unauthorized purchases with misappropriated bankcard information, impersonation or other similar fraud claims. We could also be subject to liability for claims relating to misuse of personal information, such as unauthorized marketing purposes. These claims also could result in protracted and costly litigation. In addition, we could be subject to penalties or sanctions from the card networks, or our reputation could be harmed, which may deter clients from using our services.\nAlthough we generally require that our agreements with our service providers who have access to merchant and customer data include confidentiality obligations that restrict these parties from using or disclosing any customer or merchant data except as necessary to perform their services under the applicable agreements, we cannot assure you that these contractual measures will prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of data. In addition, our agreements with financial institutions require us to take certain protective measures to ensure the confidentiality of merchant and consumer data. Any failure to adequately enforce these protective measures could result in protracted and costly litigation.\nThe Heartland Secure solution could be breached at one or many merchant locations. In the event of a breach of the Heartland Secure solution, we could face material financial liability.\nIn 2015, we began offering a warranty to merchants using the Heartland Secure\u2122 solution, a comprehensive credit/debit card secure payment solution combining EMV, the Heartland E3\u00ae end-to-end encryption technology and tokenization. Through the warranty, Heartland agrees not to pass on to covered merchants those costs, fees and fines from card brands that result from a breach.\nThe Heartland Secure solution could be breached at one or many merchant locations. In the event of a breach of the Heartland Secure solution, we could face liability for the costs associated with the breach, and the fees and fines assessed by the card brands. In addition, we may face liability arising from: (i) claims for unauthorized purchases with misappropriated bankcard information, (ii) impersonation or other related fraud claims; (iii) products liability claims; and/or (iv) breach of warranty claims. We could face protracted and costly litigation relating to such claims. If the Heartland Secure solution is breached, our reputation could be harmed, which may deter clients from using our services, and such a breach may have a material adverse effect upon our financial position and results of operations.\nUnauthorized disclosure of customer, educational institution, employee or other user data from our business services other than our Payment Processing business, whether through breach of our computer systems, cyber-attack or otherwise, could expose us to liability and protracted and costly litigation, as well as harm our reputation.\nWe collect and store sensitive data about customers, educational institutions and employees, including names, addresses, social security numbers, driver's license numbers and checking account numbers. Any unauthorized use, cyber-\nattack, unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, network disruption, denial of service, corruption of data, or theft of non-public or other sensitive information, similar act by a malevolent party, or inadvertent acts by our own employees, could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, and could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations, or that of our customers.\nIf we fail to comply with the applicable requirements of the Visa and MasterCard bankcard networks, Visa or MasterCard could seek to fine us, suspend us or terminate our registrations. Fines could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, and if these registrations are terminated, we will not be able to conduct our primary business.\nOn occasion, we have received notices from Visa and MasterCard of non-compliance and fines, which have typically related to excessive chargebacks by a merchant or data security failures on the part of a merchant. If we are unable to recover fines from our merchants, we will experience a financial loss. The termination of our registration, or any changes in the Visa or MasterCard rules that would impair our registration, could require us to stop providing Visa and MasterCard payment processing services, which would make it impossible for us to conduct our business on its current scale.\nWe rely on sponsor banks, which have substantial discretion with respect to certain elements of our business practices, in order to process bankcard transactions. If these sponsorships are terminated and we are unable to secure new bank sponsors, we will not be able to conduct significant portions of our business.\nOver 72% of our revenue is derived from processing Visa and MasterCard bankcard transactions. Because we are not a bank, we are not eligible for membership in the Visa and MasterCard networks and are, therefore, unable to directly access the bankcard networks. Instead, Visa and MasterCard operating regulations require us to be sponsored by a member bank in order to process bankcard transactions. We are currently registered with Visa and MasterCard through Wells Fargo Bank N.A. since February 2012, The Bancorp Bank since November 2009, and Barclays Bank Delaware since March 2011.\nOur sponsorship agreements with Wells Fargo Bank N.A., The Bancorp Bank and Barclays Bank Delaware expire in February 2016, February 2017 and March 2021, respectively. On November 5, 2015, we entered into a sponsorship agreement with Deutsche Bank for our SME merchants, which will replace the sponsorship agreement with Wells Fargo Bank N.A. The sponsorship agreement with Deutsche Bank expires in November 2020. If our sponsorships are terminated and we are unable to secure another bank sponsor or sponsors, which could arise due to future consolidation of sponsor banks or because sponsor banks exit this line of business, we will not be able to process Visa and MasterCard transactions. Furthermore, some agreements give the sponsor banks substantial discretion in approving certain aspects of our business practices, including our solicitation, application and qualification procedures for merchants, the terms of our agreements with merchants and our customer service levels. Our sponsor banks' discretionary actions under these agreements could be detrimental to our operations.\nCurrent or future bankcard network rules and practices could adversely affect our business.\nWe are registered with the Visa and MasterCard networks through our bank sponsors as an ISO with Visa and a Member Service Provider with MasterCard. We are currently a sales agent and service agent for American Express and a registered acquirer with Discover. The rules of the bankcard networks are set by their boards, which may be strongly influenced by card issuers, and some of those card issuers are our competitors with respect to these processing services. The rules of the bankcard networks may change from time-to-time. Many banks directly or indirectly sell processing services to merchants in direct competition with us. These banks could attempt, by virtue of their influence on the networks, to alter the networks' rules or policies to the detriment of non-members like us. The termination of our registration or our status as an ISO or Member Service Provider, or any changes in card network or issuer rules that limit our ability to provide payment processing services, could have an adverse effect on our bankcard processing volumes, revenues or operating costs. In addition, if we were precluded from processing Visa and MasterCard bankcard transactions, we would lose the majority of our revenues.\nAny new laws and regulations, or revisions made to existing laws, regulations, or other industry standards affecting our business may have an unfavorable impact on our operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is impacted by laws and regulations that affect the bankcard industry. In July 2010, Congress passed The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), which significantly changed financial regulation. Changes included restricting amounts of debit card fees that certain issuer banks can charge merchants and allowing merchants to offer discounts for different payment methods. The impact which requirements imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act or other new regulation will have on our operating results is difficult to determine, as their implementation could result in the need for us to modify our services and processing platforms. As new requirements are mandated, these regulations could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, the requirements of the new regulations and the timing of their effective dates could result in changes in our clients' business practices that may alter their delivery of their\nproducts and services to consumers and the timing of their investment decisions, which could change the demand for our services as well as alter the type or volume of transactions that we process on behalf of our clients.\nAdditionally, all persons engaged in commerce, including, but not limited to, us and our merchant and financial institution customers, are subject to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices, or UDAP. The Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, has authority to take action against nonbanks that engage in UDAP and to the extent we are processing payments for a merchant engaged in UDAP, we may be subject to action by the FTC.\nOn July 26, 2011, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or FinCEN, issued a final rule regarding the applicability of the Bank Secrecy Act's regulations to \u201cprepaid access\u201d products and services. This rulemaking clarifies the anti-money laundering obligations for entities engaged in the provision and sale of prepaid services such as prepaid cards. We have registered with FinCEN as a \u201cmoney services business-provider of prepaid access\u201d in accordance with the rule. Notwithstanding previously implemented anti-money laundering procedures pursuant to various contractual obligations, the rule increases our regulatory risks and, as with other regulatory requirements, violations of the rule could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to assist our Sponsor banks in complying with certain of their regulatory obligations. In particular, the anti-money laundering provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act require that customer identifying information be obtained and verified. In addition, both we and our Sponsor banks are subject to the laws and regulations enforced by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, which prohibit U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with certain prohibited persons or entities. Our failure to comply with any of these laws or rights could materially and adversely affect our business, financial credit and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations relating to the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information and data regarding our customers and their financial information. In addition, we are bound by our own privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data, which are posted on certain of our website pages. New legislation and regulations in this area have been proposed, both at the federal and state level. Such measures, including pending Federal legislation, would potentially impose additional obligations on us, including requiring that we provide notifications to consumers and government authorities in the event of a data breach or unauthorized access or disclosure, beyond what state law already requires.\nThese and other laws and regulations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even an inadvertent failure to comply with laws and regulations, given rapidly evolving social expectations of corporate fairness, could damage our business or our reputation.\nGovernmental regulations designed to protect or limit access to consumer information could adversely affect our ability to effectively provide our services to merchants.\nGovernmental bodies in the United States and abroad have adopted, or are considering the adoption of, laws and regulations restricting the collection, use and transfer of, and safeguarding, non-public personal information. For example, in the United States, all financial institutions must undertake certain steps to ensure the privacy and security of consumer financial information. While our operations are subject to certain provisions of these privacy laws, we have limited our use of consumer information solely to providing services to other businesses and financial institutions. We limit sharing of non-public personal information to that necessary to complete the transactions on behalf of the consumer and the merchant and to that permitted by federal and state laws. In connection with providing services to the merchants and financial institutions that use our services, we are required by regulations and contracts with our merchants to provide assurances regarding the confidentiality and security of non-public consumer information. These contracts require periodic audits by independent companies regarding our compliance with industry standards and best practices established by regulatory guidelines. The compliance standards relate to our infrastructure, components, and operational procedures designed to safeguard the confidentiality and security of non-public consumer personal information shared by our clients with us. Our ability to maintain compliance with these standards and satisfy these audits will affect our ability to attract and maintain business in the future. The cost of such systems and procedures may increase in the future and could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other similarly situated service providers.\nIn many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but also to transfers of information among the company and our subsidiaries. In addition, the possession and use of personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to laws that may require notification to regulators, clients or employees in the event of a privacy breach. These laws continue to develop, the number of jurisdictions adopting such laws continues to increase, and these laws may be inconsistent\nfrom jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The future enactment of more restrictive laws, rules or regulations could materially adversely impact our operations and the financial condition of our company, through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability. In addition, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase.\nGlobal economics, political and other conditions may adversely affect trends in consumer spending, which may adversely impact our revenue and profitability.\nA recessionary economic environment could have a negative impact on our merchants, which may, in turn, adversely impact our revenue and profitability, particularly if the recessionary environment disproportionately affects some of the market segments that represent a larger portion of our card processing volume, like restaurants. The industries in which we operate depend heavily upon the overall level of consumer and business spending.\nAdverse economic trends may accelerate the timing, or increase the impact of, risks to our financial performance. Such trends may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\na declining economy and the pace of economic recovery can change consumer spending behaviors;\n\u2022\nlow levels of consumer and business confidence typically associated with recessionary environments, may cause decreased spending by cardholders;\n\u2022\na decline in the use of credit, debit or prepaid cards as a payment mechanism for their transactions or an adverse change in the mix of payments between cash, alternative currencies, credit, debit and prepaid cards;\n\u2022\nbudgetary concerns in the United States could impact consumer confidence and spending and increase the risks of operating our business;\n\u2022\nfinancial institutions may restrict credit lines to cardholders or limit the issuance of new cards to mitigate cardholder defaults;\n\u2022\nuncertainty and volatility in the performance of our clients\u2019 businesses may make estimates of our revenues, rebates, incentives, and realization of prepaid assets less predictable;\n\u2022\nour clients may decrease spending for value-added services; and\n\u2022\ngovernment intervention, including the effect of laws, regulations, and/or government investments in our clients, may have potential negative effects on our business and our relationships with our clients or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our products.\nIf our merchants make fewer sales of their products and services, we will have fewer transactions to process, resulting in lower revenue and profits. In addition, we have a certain amount of fixed and semi-fixed costs, including rent and salaries, which could limit our ability to quickly adjust costs and respond to changes in our business and the economy.\nIn a recessionary environment our merchants could also experience a higher rate of business closures, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. During the 2008-2009 recession, we experienced negative same-store sales growth (or contraction) and an increase in business closures. In the event of a closure of a merchant, we are unlikely to receive our fees for any transactions processed by that merchant in its final month of operation.\nWe have faced, and will in the future face, chargeback liability when our merchants refuse or cannot reimburse chargebacks resolved in favor of their customers, reject losses when our merchants go out of business, and merchant fraud. We cannot accurately anticipate these liabilities, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn the event a billing dispute between a cardholder and a merchant is not resolved in favor of the merchant, the transaction is normally \u201ccharged back\u201d to the merchant and the purchase price is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder by the card-issuing bank and charged to the merchant. If we or our clearing banks are unable to collect such amounts from the merchant's account, or if the merchant refuses or is unable, due to closure, bankruptcy or other reasons, to reimburse us for the chargeback, we bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder. The risk of chargebacks is typically greater with those merchants that promise future delivery of goods and services rather than delivering goods or rendering services at the time of payment. We may experience significant losses from chargebacks in the future. Any increase in chargebacks not paid by our merchants may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also bear the risk of reject losses, which arise from the fact that we typically collect our fees from our SME merchants on the first day after the monthly billing period. This results in the build-up of a substantial receivable from our customers, which significantly exceeds the receivables of any of our competitors which generally assess their fees on a daily basis. If a merchant has gone out of business during the billing period, changes their demand deposit account, or institutes\nblocks on its demand deposit account, we may be unable to collect such fees. We maintain cash deposits or require the pledge of a letter of credit from certain merchants and we also maintain a loss reserve against losses including major fraud losses, which are unpredictable and involve large monetary amounts; however, these may not be sufficient to eliminate the risk of loss, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if our sponsor bank is unable, due to system disruption or other failure, to collect our fees from our merchants, we would face a substantial loss.\nWe have potential liability for fraudulent bankcard transactions initiated by merchants. Merchant fraud occurs when a merchant knowingly uses a stolen or counterfeit bankcard or card number to record a false sales transaction, processes an invalid bankcard or intentionally fails to deliver the merchandise or services sold in an otherwise valid transaction. We have established systems and procedures designed to detect and reduce the impact of merchant fraud, but we cannot assure you that these measures are or will be effective. It is possible that incidents of fraud could increase in the future. Failure to effectively manage risk and prevent fraud would increase our chargeback liability. Increases in chargebacks could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we incurred charges relating to chargebacks, reject losses and merchant fraud of $2.9 million, $7.3 million and $3.1 million, respectively, or 0.31 basis points, 0.90 basis points and 0.41 basis points, respectively of our SME card processing volume. In 2014, our losses included $4.6 million resulting from chargebacks from a single merchant who entered bankruptcy in the fourth quarter.\nWe rely on various financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities. If we are unable to maintain clearing services with these financial institutions and are unable to find a replacement, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on various financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities. If such financial institutions should stop providing clearing services, we must find other financial institutions to provide those services. If we are unable to find a replacement financial institution we may no longer be able to provide processing services to certain customers, which could negatively impact our revenue and earnings.\nIncreased merchant attrition that we cannot offset with increased card processing volume would cause our revenues to decline.\nWe experience attrition in merchant card processing volume resulting from several factors, including business closures, transfers of merchants' accounts to our competitors, account closures that we initiate due to heightened credit risks and reductions in our merchants\u2019 sales volumes. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we experienced average annualized attrition in our SME card processing volume of 10.0%, 12.7% and 12.9%, respectively. Substantially all of our SME processing contracts may be terminated by either party on relatively short notice. We cannot predict the level of attrition in the future, and it could increase. Increased attrition in merchant card processing volume may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to establish accounts with new merchants or otherwise increase our card processing volume in order to counter the effect of this attrition, our revenues will decline.\nIf we cannot pass increases in bankcard network interchange fees, assessments and transaction fees along to our merchants, our operating margins will be reduced.\nWe pay interchange fees and other network fees set by the bankcard networks to the card issuing bank and the bankcard networks for each transaction we process. From time to time, the bankcard networks increase the interchange fees and other network fees that they charge payment processors and the sponsor banks. At their sole discretion, our sponsor banks have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees on to us and have always done so in the past. We are allowed to, and in the past we have been able to, pass these fee increases along to our merchants through corresponding increases in our processing fees. However, if we are unable to do so in the future, our operating margins will be reduced.\nThe payment processing industry is highly competitive and we compete with certain firms that are larger and that have greater financial resources. Such competition could increase, which would adversely influence our prices to merchants, and as a result, our operating margins.\nThe market for payment processing services is highly competitive. Other providers of payment processing services have established a sizable market share in the small and mid-sized merchant processing sector. Maintaining our historic growth will depend on a combination of the continued growth in electronic payment transactions and our ability to increase our market share. According to The Nilson Report, we accounted for approximately 4.5% of the 84.5 billion of purchase transactions processed by all U.S. bankcard acquirers in 2014. The competition we face may affect the prices we are able to charge. If the competition causes us to reduce the prices we charge, we will have to aggressively control our costs or our profit margins will decline. In addition, some of our competitors are financial institutions, subsidiaries of financial institutions or well-established\npayment processing companies. Our competitors that are financial institutions or subsidiaries of financial institutions do not incur the costs associated with being sponsored by a bank into the card networks and can settle transactions more quickly for their merchants than we can for ours. These competitors have substantially greater financial, technological, management and marketing resources than we have. This may allow our competitors to offer more attractive fees to our current and prospective merchants, or other products or services that we do not offer. This could result in a loss of customers, greater difficulty attracting new customers, and a reduction in the price we can charge for our products and services. If this were to occur, there is no assurance we can successfully control our costs in order to maintain our profit margins. One or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe payment processing market in which we compete is subject to rapid technological changes. These markets are characterized by technological change, new product introductions (including mobile payment applications), evolving industry standards and changing customer needs. In order to remain competitive, we are continually involved in a number of projects to offer our customers convenient and efficient solutions for their payment needs. Any delay in the delivery of new services or the failure to differentiate our services or to accurately predict and address market demand could render our services less desirable, or even obsolete, to our clients. These projects carry the risks associated with any development effort, including cost overruns, delays in delivery and performance problems. Any failure to deliver reliable, effective and secure services that meet the expectations of our clients could result in increased costs and/or a loss in business and revenues that could reduce our earnings. In addition, many of our competitors may have the ability to devote more financial and operational resources than we can to the development of new technologies and services, including Internet payment processing services and mobile payment processing services that provide improved operating functionality and features to their product and service offerings. If more successful than ours, their development efforts could render our product and services offerings less desirable to customers, again resulting in the loss of customers or a reduction in the price we could demand for our offerings. Furthermore, our merchants\u2019 and their customers\u2019 potential negative reaction to our products and services can spread quickly through social media and damage our reputation before we have the opportunity to respond. If we are unable to develop, adapt to or access technological changes or evolving industry standards on a timely and cost effective basis, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected.\nNon-traditional electronic payments competitors are also increasingly entering the markets in which we operate. Furthermore, we are facing new competitive pressure from non-traditional payments processors and other parties entering the payments industry, such as PayPal, Google, Apple, Alibaba and Amazon, who may compete in one or more of the functions performed in processing merchant transactions. These companies have significant financial resources and robust networks and are highly regarded by consumers. If these companies gain a greater share of total electronic payments transactions or if we are unable to successfully react to changes in the industry spurred by the entry of these new market participants, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur systems and our third-party providers' systems may fail due to factors beyond our control, which could interrupt our service, cause us to lose business and increase our costs.\nWe depend on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer network systems, software, data center and telecommunications networks, as well as the systems of third parties. Our systems and operations or those of our third-party providers could be exposed to damage or interruption from, among other things, fire, natural disaster, power loss, telecommunications failure, unauthorized entry and computer viruses. A system outage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Although we have taken steps to protect against data loss and system failures, there is still risk that we may lose critical data or experience system failures. Our property and business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur. Defects in our systems or those of third parties, errors or delays in the processing of payment transactions, telecommunications failures or other difficulties could result in:\n\u2022\nloss of revenues;\n\u2022\nloss of merchants, although our contracts with merchants do not expressly provide a right to terminate for business interruptions;\n\u2022\nloss of merchant and cardholder data;\n\u2022\nharm to our business or reputation;\n\u2022\nexposure to fraud losses or other liabilities;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity;\n\u2022\nadditional operating and development costs; and/or\n\u2022\ndiversion of technical and other resources.\nWe may experience software defects, computer viruses, and development delays, which could damage client relations, our potential profitability and expose us to liability.\nOur products are based on sophisticated software and computing systems that often encounter development delays, and the underlying software may contain undetected errors, viruses, or defects. Defects in our software products and errors or delays in our processing of electronic transactions could result in additional development costs, diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts, loss of credibility with current or potential customers, harm to our reputation, or exposure to liability claims. In addition, we rely on technologies supplied to us by third parties that may also contain undetected errors, viruses or defects that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Although we attempt to limit our potential liability for warranty claims through disclaimers in our software documentation and limitation-of-liability provisions in our license and other agreements with our clients, we cannot assure that these measures will be successful in limiting our liability. Additionally, we and many of our customers are subject to payment network rules. If we do not comply with the payment network requirements or standards, we may be subject fines or sanctions, including suspension or termination of our registration.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights and defend ourselves from potential patent infringement claims, our competitive advantages may diminish or our ability to offer services to our customers could be restricted.\nOur patents, trademarks, proprietary software and other intellectual property are critical to our future success. We rely on proprietary technology. It is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technologies. Assurance of protecting our rights and proprietary information cannot be guaranteed. Our patents could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide any meaningful protection or advantage. If we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies, we could lose competitive advantages and be materially adversely affected. Adverse determinations in judicial or administrative proceedings could prevent us from precluding others from selling competing services, and thereby may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAdditionally, claims have been made, and other claims may be made in the future, with regard to our services or technology infringing on a patent or other intellectual property rights of others. Third parties may have, or may eventually be issued, patents that could be infringed by our services or technology. Any of these third parties could make a claim of infringement against us with respect to our services or technology. We may also be subject to claims by third parties for breach of copyright, trademark, license usage or other intellectual property rights. Any claim from third parties may result in a limitation on our ability to use the intellectual property subject to these claims, restrict us from delivering the related service or result in an unfavorable settlement that could be material to our operating results, financial condition and cash flow. Also, in recent years, individuals and groups have been purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies like ours. Even if we believe that intellectual property related claims are without merit, defending against such claims is time consuming and expensive and could result in the diversion of the time and attention of our management and employees. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected services, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our services. Even if we have an agreement for indemnification against such costs, the indemnifying party, if any in such circumstances, may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations. If we cannot or do not license the infringed technology on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, our revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.\nFinally, we use open source software in connection with our technology and services. Companies that incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. While we monitor the use of open source software in our technology and services and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose the source code to the related technology or service, such use could inadvertently occur and any requirement to disclose our proprietary source code could be harmful to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse conditions in markets in which we obtain a substantial amount of our card processing volume, such as our largest SME merchant markets of California, Texas, Florida, New York, and Pennsylvania, could negatively affect our results of operations.\nAdverse economic or other conditions in California, Texas, New York, Florida and Pennsylvania would negatively affect our revenue and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In December 2015, SME merchants located in these states represented the following percentages of our SME card processing volume: California represented\n13.0%, Texas represented 6.2%, Florida represented 5.8%, New York represented 5.1% and Pennsylvania represented 3.5%, respectively. As a result of this geographic concentration of our merchants in these markets, we are exposed to the risks of downturns in these local economies and to other local conditions, which could adversely affect the operating results of our merchants in these markets. No other state represented more than 3.3% of our SME card processing volume in December 2015.\nIf we lose key personnel or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel as we grow, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe are dependent upon the ability and experience of a number of our key personnel who have substantial experience with our operations, the rapidly changing payment processing industry and the selected markets in which we offer our services. It is possible that the loss of the services of one or a combination of our senior executives or key managers, particularly Robert O. Carr, our Chief Executive Officer, would have an adverse effect on our operations. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, manage and retain other qualified middle management and technical and clerical personnel as we grow. We may not continue to attract or retain such personnel.\nAdditionally, to successfully compete in the market and grow our business, we must attract, recruit, retain and develop the necessary personnel who can provide needed expertise. We may be required to hire additional personnel to execute our strategic plans. However, the market for qualified personnel is competitive, and we may not succeed in recruiting additional personnel or may fail to effectively replace current personnel who depart our company. Failure to retain or attract qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified sales people, our business and financial results may suffer.\nUnlike many of our competitors who rely on ISOs or salaried salespeople and telemarketers, we rely on a direct sales force whose compensation is entirely commission-based. Through our direct sales force of approximately 1,069 Relationship Managers and Territory Managers and 171 product specialists (SPAs), we seek to increase the number of merchants using our products and services. We intend to significantly increase the size of our sales force. Our success depends, in part, on the skill and experience of our sales force. If we are unable to retain and attract sufficiently experienced and capable Relationship Managers, Territory Managers and SPAs, our business and financial results may suffer.\nAny potential strategic acquisitions or buyouts of our sales persons portfolio equity that we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\nWe expect to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, products or technologies. We may not be able to successfully finance or integrate any businesses, products or technologies that we acquire. Furthermore, the integration of any acquisition may divert management's time and resources from our core business and disrupt our operations. We may spend time and money on projects that do not increase our revenue. To the extent we pay the purchase price of any acquisition in cash, it would reduce our cash reserves or increase our borrowings, and to the extent the purchase price is paid with our stock, it could be dilutive to our stockholders. We, from time to time, evaluate potential acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies, and anticipate continuing to make these evaluations.\nWe also regularly buy out the residual commissions of our Relationship Managers and sales managers, at multiples that typically amount to 2 1/2 years of such commissions. If the merchants included in the portfolios we purchase do not generate sufficient incremental margin after the purchase, we will not achieve a positive return on the cash expended.\nWe may not be able to continue to expand our share of the existing payment processing markets or expand into new markets which would inhibit our ability to grow and increase our profitability.\nOur future growth and profitability depend upon the growth of the markets in which we currently operate and our ability to increase our penetration and service offerings within these markets, as well as the emergence of new markets for our services and our ability to penetrate these new markets. According to The Nilson Report, we accounted for approximately 4.5% of the 84.5 billion of purchase transactions processed by all U.S. bankcard acquirers in 2014. It is difficult to attract new clients due to transition costs, business disruption and loss of accustomed functionality in connection a change in payment processing vendors. We seek to overcome these obstacles by offering enhanced functionality, greater data security, high customer service levels and competitive pricing. However, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful and the inability to grow in the markets in which we operate may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur expansion into new markets in which we do not currently have any operating experience is also dependent upon our ability to adapt our existing technology and offerings or to develop new or innovative applications to meet the particular service needs of each new market. In order to do so, we will need to anticipate and react to market changes and devote appropriate\nfinancial and technical resources to our development efforts, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts.\nOur operating results are subject to seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly net income.\nWe have experienced in the past, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our revenues as a result of consumer spending patterns. Historically, due to seasonal retail sales, our revenues have been strongest in our second and third quarters, and weakest in our first quarter.\nWe may become subject to additional U.S., state or local taxes that cannot be passed through to our merchants, which could negatively affect our results of operations.\nCompanies in the payment processing industry, including us, may become subject to taxation in various tax jurisdictions based on our net income or revenues. Taxing jurisdictions have not yet adopted uniform positions on taxation. If we are required to pay additional taxes on our net income or revenues and are unable to pass the tax expense through to our merchants, our costs would increase and our net income would be reduced.\nWe may need to raise additional funds to finance our future capital needs, which may prevent us from growing our business.\nWe may need to raise additional funds to finance our future capital needs, including developing new products and technologies, and operating expenses. We may need additional financing earlier than we anticipate if we:\n\u2022\nexpand faster than our internally generated cash flow can support;\n\u2022\npurchase portfolio equity (the portion of our commissions that we have committed to our sales force for as long as the merchant processes with us, which we may buy out at an agreed multiple) from a large number of Relationship Managers or sales managers;\n\u2022\nadd new merchant accounts faster than expected;\n\u2022\nneed to reduce pricing in response to competition;\n\u2022\nrepurchase our common stock or pay dividends; or\n\u2022\nacquire complementary products, business or technologies.\nIf we raise additional funds through the sale of equity securities, these transactions may dilute the value of our outstanding common stock. We may also decide to issue securities, including debt securities that have rights, preferences and privileges senior to our common stock. We may be unable to raise additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all. If financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we may be unable to fund our future needs. This may prevent us from increasing our market share, capitalizing on new business opportunities or remaining competitive in our industry.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nBorrowings under our Credit Agreement could adversely affect our financial condition, and the related debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow and ability to invest in and grow our businesses.\nThe interest rates on debt outstanding under our Credit Agreement are floating based on the LIBOR rate; accordingly, if the LIBOR rate increases, our interest expense will be higher on the portion of our debt outstanding not managed with interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2015, there was $481.9 million outstanding under our Credit Agreement.\nWe intend to fulfill our total debt service obligations primarily from cash generated by our operations. Such funds will not be available to use in future operations, or investing in our businesses. This may adversely impact our ability to expand our businesses or make other investments. If we are unable to meet our debt obligations, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our obligations, to seek additional equity financing or to sell assets, which we may not be able to do on satisfactory terms or at all. As a result, we could default on those obligations and in the event of such default, our lenders could accelerate our debt or take other actions that could restrict our operations.\nOur borrowing agreements contain restrictions which may limit our flexibility in operating and growing our business.\nOur borrowing agreements contain covenants regarding our maintenance of certain leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. Our borrowing agreements also include covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions, including among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or issue equity;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our common stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments (including acquisitions) and distributions;\n\u2022\nsell certain assets;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with respect to our affiliates,\n\u2022\nability to enter into business combinations, and\n\u2022\ncertain other financial and non-financial covenants.\nWe were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2015. Failure to be in compliance with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all or a portion of our outstanding indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur balance sheet includes significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets. The impairment of a significant portion of these assets would negatively affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs a result of recent acquisitions, a significant portion of our total assets consist of goodwill and intangible assets. Combined goodwill and intangible assets, net of amortization, accounted for approximately 45% of the total assets on our balance sheet at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We may not realize the full carrying value of our intangible assets and goodwill. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually and during interim periods if an event occurs or changes in circumstances suggest a potential decline in the fair value of goodwill. We also evaluate intangible assets on an ongoing basis for indicators of impairment. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator or change in circumstances relating to impairment has occurred. If testing indicates that impairment has occurred, we would be required to write-off the impaired portion of goodwill and such intangible assets, resulting in a charge to our earnings. An impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our impairment testing in 2014 indicated an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets relating to Leaf Acquisition, LLC (\u201cLeaf\u201d), a previous Heartland Commerce business reporting unit and related POS assets resulting in pre-tax impairment charges of $37.4 million, of which $18.5 million was related to goodwill.\nThe costs and effects of pending and future litigation, investigations or similar matters, or adverse facts and developments related thereto, could materially affect our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flow.\nWe are from time-to-time involved in various litigation matters and governmental or regulatory investigations or similar matters arising out of our current or future business. Our insurance or indemnities may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us, and any claims asserted against us, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, may harm our reputation. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves in pending or future litigation or similar matters under various laws. If we are unsuccessful in our defense in these litigation matters, or any other legal proceeding, we may be forced to pay damages or fines that significantly exceed our insurance coverage, enter into consent decrees, and/or change our business practices, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on the results of our business operations and financial condition. For more information about our legal proceedings, refer to \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d herein.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, could depress our stock price.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our equity securities. At December 31, 2015, we had 36,933,825 shares of our common stock outstanding. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding stock options and restricted share units representing 1,035,950 shares issued under our amended and restated 2008 Equity Incentive Plan and our 2000 Incentive Stock Option Plan, of which 5,900 were vested. Assuming the exercise of all outstanding options to acquire our common stock and the vesting of all restricted share units and performance share units, our current stockholders would own on a fully-diluted basis 95% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, and the number of shares of our common stock available to trade could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In addition to the adverse effect a price decline could have on holders of our common stock, such a decline could impede our ability to raise capital or to make acquisitions through the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities.\nFailure to maintain effective systems of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could cause a loss of confidence in our financial reporting and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide accurate financial information. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the\nend of each fiscal year and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control, we may not be able to conclude and report that we have effective internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to adequately maintain our internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, negatively affecting the trading price of our common stock, or our ability to access the capital markets.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage a takeover that our stockholders may consider favorable or could cause current management to become entrenched and difficult to replace.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, in our bylaws and under Delaware law could make it more difficult for other companies to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain the following provisions, among others, which may inhibit an acquisition of our company by a third party:\n\u2022\nadvance notification procedures for matters to be brought before stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\na limitation on who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue up to 10 million shares of preferred stock without a stockholder vote.\nIf any shares of preferred stock are issued that contain an extraordinary dividend or special voting power, a change in control could be impeded.\nWe are also subject to provisions of Delaware law that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d meaning, generally, that a stockholder who beneficially owns more than 15% of our stock cannot acquire us for a period of three years from the date this person became an interested stockholder unless various conditions are met, such as approval of the transaction by our Board of Directors. Any of these restrictions could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control.\nWe may be unable or we may decide not to pay dividends on our common stock at a level anticipated by stockholders, which could depress our stock price.\nThe payment of dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other factors, our earnings, stockholders' equity, cash position and financial condition. No assurance can be given that we will be able to or will choose to pay any dividends in the future.", "PERMNO": 90833, "SIC": 6099, "TIC": "HPY"}
