{"cik": "1005286", "company": "LANDEC CORP \\CA\\", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-08-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business faces significant risks and uncertainties. Certain important factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations, any of which could subsequently have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock, and you should carefully consider them. Accordingly, in evaluating our business, we encourage you to consider the following discussion of risk factors in its entirety, in addition to other information contained in or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other public filings with the SEC. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in future periods.\nOur shareholder value creation program, Project SWIFT, may not have the anticipated results, exposes us to additional restructuring costs and operational risks, and may be negatively perceived in the markets.\nWe have previously announced the development of a shareholder value creation program, Project SWIFT, designed to strategically realign our Curation Foods business to focus the business on its strategic assets and redesign the organization to be the appropriate size to compete and thrive. This program includes reviewing strategic options for our legacy vegetable bag and tray business, the closure of certain leased offices in Santa Clara, California and Los Angeles, California, the divestiture of our yet-to-be-operational salad dressing plant in Ontario, California, planned divestiture of our underutilized Hanover manufacturing facility, and certain other actions taken to redesign the Curation Foods organization. We may not be able to implement all of the actions that we intend to take in this program and we may not be able to realize the expected benefits from such realignment and restructuring plans or other similar restructurings on the anticipated timing, or at all. In addition, we may incur additional restructuring costs in implementing such realignment and restructuring plans or other similar future plans in excess of our expectations. The implementation of our restructuring efforts, including the potential reduction of our facilities and workforce, may not improve our operational and cost structure or result in greater efficiency of our organization; and we may not be able to support sustainable revenue growth and profitability following such restructurings. Any reduction in workforce or divestitures of facilities or other assets may also expose us to additional risks, including potential litigation (including labor and employment disputes), unforeseen costs or adverse impacts to the operations of our retained businesses. In addition, our strategic realignment efforts may not be viewed positively by shareholders and analysts, which may cause our stock price to decline or become volatile.\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic, or any other pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease in the United States or worldwide may adversely affect our business.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, China. This virus continues to spread globally and, as of May 31, 2020, has spread to approximately 160 countries, including the United States. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate the outbreak have caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas and significant disruption to our businesses and to the financial markets both globally and in the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic has had and we believe will continue to have significant adverse impacts on many aspects of the Company\u2019s operations, directly and indirectly, including with respect to sales, customer behaviors, business and manufacturing operations, inventory, the Company\u2019s employees, and the market generally, and the scope and nature of these impacts continue to evolve each day. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in and may continue to result in, regional quarantines, labor shortages or stoppages, adverse changes in consumer purchasing patterns, reductions in customer demand for our products, increased safety and compliance costs, disruptions to our supply chains, suppliers and service providers to deliver materials and services on a timely basis, and overall economic instability, which have significantly adversely affected and could further adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our suppliers, growers, and corporate partners have reduced staffing and have reduced, delayed and postponed certain projects, initiatives or other arrangements in response to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may continue or worsen as the pandemic continues. These actions have resulted in and may result in further business and manufacturing disruption, inventory shortages, delivery delays, additional costs, and reduced sales and operations for us, any of which have and could further significantly affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. With respect to our Curation Foods business specifically, the responses to the COVID-19 pandemic have also adversely impacted and may further impact consumer spending and our customer\u2019s preferences, which have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our sales in that segment. With respect to our Lifecore business, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted and may continue to result in fewer elective medical procedures, which, in turn, has and may continue to adversely impact our business and sales. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted our business is difficult to ascertain, and future potential impacts to our business will depend on how the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, which is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Such future developments may include, among others, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the economies and financial markets worldwide, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products, our ability to obtain financing\non favorable terms, our ability to comply with our obligations (including leases and debt covenants) and otherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic remains fluid, and given its inherent uncertainty, we expect that it will continue to have significant adverse impacts on our business in the future. The duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, or any other future pandemic, epidemic or outbreak, depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, suppliers, distributors and manufacturers. Should these conditions persist for a prolonged period, the COVID-19 pandemic, including any of the above factors and others that are currently unknown, could continue to have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed elsewhere in this Report, any of which could have a material effect on us.\nOur credit facility provides our lenders with a lien against substantially all of our assets, and contains financial covenants that may limit our operational flexibility and cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are party to a credit agreement, as amended, which contains a number of covenants that limit our ability and our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, create liens, engage in transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate with other companies, or sell substantially all of our assets. We are also required to maintain certain financial covenants, including a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The terms of our credit facility may restrict our current and future operations and could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to execute preferred business strategies. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies who are not subject to such restrictions. In addition, in connection with the recent amendments to our credit facility, certain additional financial covenants that remain in effect through February 28, 2021, including with respect to minimum cumulative monthly Unadjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d) thresholds and maximum capital expenditures, additional reporting obligations, and increases to the maximum interest rates and borrowing costs were implemented, which may further adversely impact our business and may increase our risks of noncompliance.\nA failure by us to comply with the covenants specified in our credit agreement, as amended, could result in an event of default under the agreement, which would give the lenders the right to terminate their commitments to provide additional loans under our credit facility and to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest, to be immediately due and payable. In addition, the lenders would have the right to proceed against the collateral we granted to them, which consists of substantially all of our assets. The maximum total leverage ratio required under our covenant for the fiscal quarter ended May 31, 2020, was 5.00 to 1.0, and thereafter decreases by 25 basis points each subsequent fiscal quarter, until it reaches 3.50 for the fiscal quarter ending November 28, 2021, and remains fixed through maturity. We were not in compliance with the maximum total leverage ratio covenant under the credit agreement as of May 31, 2020, which was waived by the lenders pursuant to the Eighth Amendment entered into on July 15, 2020. In addition, we were not in compliance with certain of our financial covenants under the credit agreement during the third quarter of fiscal 2020, which were also waived by our lenders. In connection with these waivers, as previously disclosed, our borrowing rates under the credit agreement were increased, additional covenant restrictions were added to the credit agreement, and we incurred certain fees and expenses. We cannot guaranty that we will be able to remain in compliance with all applicable covenants under the credit agreement in the future, that our lenders will elect to provide similar waivers or enter into similar amendments in the future, or, if the lenders do provide similar waivers, that those waivers will not be conditioned upon additional costs or restrictions that could materially or adversely our business, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, if the debt under our credit facility were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the debt or sell sufficient assets to repay the debt, which could immediately, materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition, and there would be no guarantee that we would be able to find alternative financing. Even if we were able to obtain alternative financing, it may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us.\nOur ability to make payments on our debt, fund our other liquidity needs, and make planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. Our historical financial results have been, and we anticipate that our future financial results will be, subject to fluctuations. Our ability to generate cash, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt, fund other liquidity needs, and make planned capital expenditures.\nAdverse weather conditions and other acts of god may cause substantial decreases in our sales and/or increases in our costs\nOur Packaged Fresh Salads and Vegetables business is subject to weather conditions that affect commodity prices, crop quality and yields, and crop varieties to be planted. Crop diseases and severe conditions, particularly weather conditions such as unexpected or excessive rain or other precipitation, unseasonable temperature fluctuations, floods, droughts, frosts, windstorms, earthquakes and hurricanes, may adversely affect the supply of vegetables and fruits used in our business, which could reduce the sales volumes and/or increase the unit production costs. The Company regularly experiences significant product sourcing issues as a result of severe adverse weather conditions that materially adversely affected the Company\u2019s financial results. Because a significant portion of the costs are fixed and contracted in advance of each operating year, volume declines reflecting production interruptions or other factors could result in increases in unit production costs which could result in substantial losses and weaken our financial condition.\nCancellations or delays of orders by our customers may adversely affect our business and the sophistication and buying power of our customers could have a negative impact on profits\nDuring the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020, sales to the Company\u2019s top five customers accounted for approximately 48% of total revenue of the Company, with the top two customers from the Curation Foods segment, Costco Corporation and Walmart, Inc. accounting for approximately 18% and 15%, respectively, of total revenues of the Company. We expect that, for the foreseeable future, a limited number of customers may continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues. We may experience changes in the composition of our customer base as we have experienced in the past. The reduction, delay or cancellation of orders from one or more major customers for any reason or the loss of one or more of our major customers could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. In addition, since some of the products processed by Curation Foods and Lifecore are sole sourced to customers, our operating results could be adversely affected if one or more of our major customers were to develop other sources of supply. Our current customers may not continue to place orders, orders by existing customers may be canceled or may not continue at the levels of previous periods, or we may not be able to obtain orders from new customers.\nOur customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs, and food distributors, have continued to consolidate, resulting in fewer customers on which we can rely for business. These consolidations, the growth of supercenters, and the growth of e-commerce customers have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength who are more capable of resisting price increases and can demand lower pricing, increased promotional programs, or specialty tailored products. In addition, larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands. These customers may also in the future use more of their shelf space, currently used for our products, for their store brand products. We continue to implement initiatives to counteract these pressures. However, if the larger size of these customers results in additional negotiating strength and/or increased private label or store brand competition, our profitability could decline.\nConsolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers\u2019 business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material adverse effect on us. For example, as noted above, if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing, then they may delay, decrease, or cancel purchases of our products, or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases.\nOur sale of some products may expose us to product liability claims\nThe testing, manufacturing, marketing, and sale of the products we develop involve an inherent risk of allegations of product liability, including foodborne illness. If any of our products are determined or alleged to be contaminated or defective or to have caused an illness, injury or harmful accident to an end-customer, we could incur substantial costs in responding to complaints or litigation regarding our products and our product brand image could be materially damaged. Such events may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, we may be required to participate in product recalls or we may voluntarily initiate a recall as a result of various industry or business practices or the need to maintain good customer relationships.\nAlthough we have taken and intend to continue to take what we consider to be appropriate precautions to minimize exposure to product liability claims, we may not be able to avoid significant liability. We currently maintain product liability insurance. While we think the coverage and limits are consistent with industry standards, our coverage may not be adequate or may not continue to be available at an acceptable cost, if at all. A product liability claim, product recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to increasing competition in the marketplace\nCompetitors may succeed in developing alternative technologies and products that are more effective, easier to use or less expensive than those which have been or are being developed by us or that would render our technology and products obsolete and non-competitive. We operate in highly competitive and rapidly evolving fields, and new developments are expected to continue at a rapid pace. Competition from large food products, industrial, medical and pharmaceutical companies is expected to be intense. In addition, the nature of our collaborative arrangements may result in our corporate partners and licensees becoming our competitors. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial and technical resources and production and marketing capabilities than we do, and may have substantially greater experience in conducting clinical and field trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing commercial products.\nThe food industry is highly competitive, and further consolidation in the industry would likely increase competition. Our principal competitors have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. Increased competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures. Competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase prices, including in response to commodity and other cost increases. We sell branded, private brand, and customized food products, as well as commercially branded foods. Our branded products have an advantage over private brand products primarily due to advertising and name recognition, although private brand products typically sell at a discount to those of branded competitors. In addition, when branded competitors focus on price and promotion, the environment for private brand producers becomes more challenging because the price difference between private brand products and branded products may become less significant. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with other private label and store brand products that are generally sold at lower prices. A strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a consumer shift towards more generic, lower-priced, or other value offerings, could result in us reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other expenditures, or losing market share. Our margins and profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume.\nIn addition, substantial growth in e-commerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models, intensifying competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry. The expanding presence of e-commerce retailers has impacted, and may continue to impact, consumer preferences and market dynamics, which in turn may negatively affect our sales or profits.\nWe must identify changing consumer preferences and develop and offer food products to meet their preferences\nConsumer preferences evolve over time and the success of our food products depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their preferences, including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness, obesity, product attributes, and ingredients. Introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment. If our products fail to meet consumer preferences, or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in acquisitions, marketing, and innovation will be less successful.\nOur future operating results are likely to fluctuate which may cause our stock price to decline\nIn the past, our results of operations have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. Curation Foods can be affected by seasonal and weather-related factors which have impacted our financial results in the past due to shortages of essential value-added produce items. In addition, the fair market value change in our Windset investment can fluctuate substantially quarter to quarter. Lifecore can be affected by the timing of orders from its relatively small customer base and the timing of the shipment of those orders. Our earnings may also fluctuate based on our ability to collect accounts receivable from customers and notes receivable from growers and on price fluctuations in the fresh vegetable and fruit markets. Other factors that affect our operations include:\n\u2022our ability and our growers\u2019 ability to obtain an adequate supply of labor,\n\u2022our growers\u2019 ability to obtain an adequate supply of water,\n\u2022the seasonality and availability and quantity of our supplies,\n\u2022our ability to process produce during critical harvest periods,\n\u2022the timing and effects of ripening,\n\u2022the degree of perishability,\n\u2022the effectiveness of worldwide distribution systems,\n\u2022total worldwide industry volumes,\n\u2022the seasonality and timing of consumer demand,\n\u2022foreign currency fluctuations, and\n\u2022foreign importation restrictions and foreign political risks\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of fluctuations in such factors. As a result of these and other factors, we expect to continue to experience fluctuations in quarterly operating results.\nOur operations are subject to regulations that directly impact our business\nOur products and operations are subject to governmental regulation in the United States and foreign countries. The manufacture of our products is subject to detailed standards for product development, manufacturing controls, ongoing quality monitoring and analysis, and periodic inspection by regulatory authorities. We may not be able to obtain necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all. Delays in receipt of or failure to receive approvals or loss of previously received approvals would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A significant portion of Curation Foods\u2019 manufacturing workforce is provided by third-party labor contractors. The Company relies upon these contractors to validate the worker\u2019s immigration status and their eligibility to work in the Company\u2019s facilities, and failure of these contractors\u2019 control processes or our internal control processes could result in Curation Foods not complying with applicable regulations. Although we have no reason to believe that we will not be able to comply with all applicable regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our products and polymer materials, regulations are always subject to change and depend heavily on administrative interpretations and the country in which the products are sold. Future changes in regulations or interpretations relating to matters such as safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, produce safety, environmental controls, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances may adversely affect our business.\nOur food operations are subject to regulation by the FDA, FTC, and other governmental entities. Applicable laws and regulations are subject to change from time to time and could impact how we manage the production, labeling, and sale of our food products. We are subject, for example, to FDA compliance and regulations concerning the safety of the food products handled and sold by Curation Foods, and the facilities in which they are packed, processed, and stored. Failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements can, among other things, result in:\n\u2022the issuance of adverse inspectional observations,\n\u2022Warning or Courtesy Letters,\n\u2022import refusals,\n\u2022fines, injunctions, civil penalties, and facility suspensions,\n\u2022withdrawal of regulatory approvals or registrations,\n\u2022product recalls and product seizures, including cessation of manufacturing and sales,\n\u2022operating restrictions, and\n\u2022criminal prosecution\nCompliance with foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations is costly and time-consuming. We may be required to incur significant costs to comply with the laws and regulations in the future which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur food packaging products are subject to regulation under the FDC Act. Under the FDC Act, any substance that when used as intended may reasonably be expected to become, directly or indirectly, a component or otherwise affect the characteristics of any food may be regulated as a food additive unless the substance is generally recognized as safe. Food packaging materials are generally not considered food additives by the FDA if the products are not expected to become components of food under their expected conditions of use. We consider our breathable membrane product to be a food packaging material not subject to approval by the FDA. We have not received any communication from the FDA concerning our breathable membrane product. If the FDA were to determine that our breathable membrane products are food additives, we may be required to submit a food contact substance notification or food additive petition for approval by the FDA. The food additive petition process, in particular, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. A determination by the FDA that a food contact substance notification or food additive petition is necessary would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur Curation Foods business is subject to the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (\u201cPACA\u201d). PACA regulates fair trade standards in the fresh produce industry and governs all the products sold by Curation Foods. Our failure to comply with the PACA requirements could among other things, result in civil penalties, suspension or revocation of a license to sell produce, and in the most egregious cases, criminal prosecution, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, the FTC and other state authorities regulate how we promote and advertise our food products, and we could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state, and local laws and regulations.\nLifecore\u2019s existing products and the products that Lifecore is developing for its customers are considered to be medical devices, drug products, or combination products, and therefore, require clearance or approval by the FDA before commercial sales\ncan be made in the United States. The products also require the approval of foreign government agencies before sales may be made in many other countries. The process of obtaining these clearances or approvals varies according to the nature and use of the product. It can involve lengthy and detailed safety and efficacy data, including clinical studies, as well as extensive site inspections and lengthy regulatory agency reviews. There can be no assurance that any of the clinical studies utilizing product produced by Lifecore for its customers will be authorized to proceed, or if authorized will show safety or effectiveness; that any of the products that Lifecore is producing for its customers that require FDA clearance or approval will obtain such clearance or approval on a timely basis, on terms acceptable to the Sponsor Company for the purpose of actually marketing the products, or at all; or that following any such clearance or approval previously unknown problems will not result in restrictions on the marketing of the products or withdrawal of clearance or approval.\nIn addition, most of the existing products being sold by Lifecore and its customers are subject to continued regulation by the FDA, various state agencies and foreign regulatory agencies, which regulate the design, nonclinical and clinical research studies, manufacturing, labeling, distribution, post-marketing product modifications, advertising, promotion, import, export, adverse event and other reporting, and record keeping procedures for such products. Aseptic processing and shared equipment manufacturing require specific quality controls. If we fail to achieve and maintain these controls, we may have to recall product, or may have to reduce or suspend production while we address any deficiencies. Marketing clearances or approvals by regulatory agencies can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following initial clearance or approval. These agencies can also limit or prevent the manufacture or distribution of Lifecore\u2019s products or change or increase the regulatory requirements applicable to such products. A determination that Lifecore is in violation of such regulations could lead to the issuance of adverse inspectional observations, a Warning Letter, imposition of civil penalties, including fines, product recalls or product seizures, preclusion of product import or export, a hold or delay in pending product approvals, withdrawal of marketing authorizations, injunctions against product manufacture and distribution, and, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions.\nFederal, state and local regulations impose various environmental controls on the use, storage, discharge or disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals and gases used in some of our manufacturing processes. Our failure to control the use of, or to restrict adequately the discharge of, hazardous substances under present or future regulations could subject us to substantial liability, cause us to clean up and incur remediation expenses, or cause our manufacturing operations to be suspended. In addition, changes in environmental regulations may impose the need for additional capital equipment or other requirements.\nAny new business acquisition will involve uncertainty relating to integration\nWe completed the Yucatan Foods acquisition in December, 2018, and the O acquisition in March, 2017. We have acquired other businesses in the past and may make additional acquisitions in the future. The successful integration of new business acquisitions may require substantial effort from the Company\u2019s management. The diversion of the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the transition process could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions. The successful combination of new businesses also requires coordination of research and development activities, manufacturing, sales and marketing efforts. In addition, the process of combining organizations located in different geographic regions could cause the interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, the Company\u2019s activities. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to retain key management, technical, sales and customer support personnel, or that the Company will realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions, and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to achieve acceptance of our new products in the marketplace\nOur success in generating significant sales of our products depends in part on our ability and that of our partners and licensees to achieve market acceptance of our new products and technology. The extent to which, and rate at which, we achieve market acceptance, including customer preferences and trends, and penetration of our current and future products is a function of many variables including, but not limited to:\n\u2022price,\n\u2022safety,\n\u2022efficacy,\n\u2022reliability,\n\u2022conversion costs,\n\u2022regulatory approvals,\n\u2022marketing and sales efforts, and\n\u2022general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns\nWe may not be able to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner or new products and technologies may not gain market acceptance. We and our partners/customers are in the early stage of product commercialization of certain Intelimer-based specialty packaging, and HA-based products and non-HA products and new oil and vinegar products. We expect that our future growth will depend in large part on our and our partners\u2019/customers\u2019 ability to develop and market new products in our target markets and in new markets. In particular, we expect that our ability to compete effectively with existing food products companies will depend substantially on developing, commercializing, achieving market acceptance of and reducing the cost of producing our products. In addition, commercial applications of some of our temperature switch polymer technology are relatively new and evolving. Our failure to develop new products or the failure of our new products to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges to U.S. trade policy, tariff and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business\nChanges in U.S. or international social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business, as well as any negative sentiment toward the U.S. as a result of such changes, could adversely affect our business. The U.S. presidential administration has instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S., economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we conduct our business.\nAs a result of policy changes of the U.S. presidential administration and U.S. government proposals, there may be greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade. Tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods. Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof, our industry and the global demand for our products, and as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to employment related claims and costs that could materially adversely affect our business\nWe have been subject in the past, and may be in the future, to claims by employees based on allegations of discrimination, negligence, harassment, and inadvertent employment of undocumented workers or unlicensed personnel, and we may be subject to payment of workers\u2019 compensation claims and other similar claims. We could incur substantial costs and our management could spend a significant amount of time responding to such complaints or litigation regarding employee claims, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, several recent decisions by the United States NLRB have found companies, such as Curation Foods, which use contract employees could be found to be \u201cjoint employers\u201d with the staffing firm, which may increase our potential exposure for any such claims from contract employees.\nWe may be subject to unionization, work stoppages, slowdowns or increased labor costs\nCurrently, none of our employees are represented by a union. However, our employees have the right under the National Labor Relations Act to form or affiliate with a union. If some or all of our workforce were to become unionized and the terms of the collective bargaining agreement were significantly different from our current compensation arrangements, it could increase our costs and adversely impact our profitability. Moreover, participation in labor unions could put us at increased risk of labor strikes and disruption of our operations.\nWe have a concentration of manufacturing for Curation Foods and Lifecore and may have to depend on third parties to manufacture our products\nWe have a limited number of manufacturing facilities, all of which use specialized manufacturing equipment to operate our business. Any disruptions in our primary manufacturing operations would reduce our ability to sell our products and would have a material adverse effect on our financial results, and create significant additional costs and inefficiencies if we were required to replace such facilities. Additionally, we may need to consider seeking collaborative arrangements with other companies to manufacture our products. If we become dependent upon third parties for the manufacture of our products, our profit margins and our ability to develop and deliver those products on a timely basis may be adversely affected. In that event, additional regulatory inspections or approvals may be required, and additional quality control measures would need to be implemented. Failures by third parties may impair our ability to deliver products on a timely basis and impair our competitive position. We may not be able to continue to successfully operate our manufacturing operations at acceptable costs, with acceptable yields, and retain adequately trained personnel.\nWe are dependent on our key employees and if one or more of them were to leave, we could experience difficulties in replacing them, or effectively transitioning their replacements and our operating results could suffer\nThe success of our business depends to a significant extent on the continued service and performance of a relatively small number of key senior management, technical, sales, and marketing personnel. The loss of any of our key personnel for an extended period may cause hardship for our business. In addition, competition for senior level personnel with knowledge and experience in our different lines of business is intense. If any of our key personnel were to leave, we would need to devote substantial resources and management attention to replace them. As a result, management attention may be diverted from managing our business, and we may need to pay higher compensation to replace these employees.\nWe are subject to the risks of doing business internationally\nWe are subject to the risks of doing business internationally. We conduct a substantial amount of business with growers and customers who are located outside the United States. We purchase avocados and vegetables from foreign growers and packers, sell products to foreign customers, and operate a production facility in Mexico. In the most recent years, there has been an increase in organized crime in Mexico, and significant changes in the Mexican government, both of which create risk for our business. We are also subject to regulations imposed by the Mexican government and to examinations by the Mexican tax authorities. Significant changes to these government regulations and to assessments by the Mexican tax authorities can have a negative impact on our operations and operating results in Mexico.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in Mexico may also adversely affect our operating results. While our operations are predominantly in the U.S., we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, expenses, profits, assets and liabilities denominated in the Mexican peso. As a result, our financial performance may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Moreover, any favorable or unfavorable impacts to gross profit, gross margin, income from operations or segment operating profit from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are likely to be inconsistent year over year.\nSince some of our expenses are paid in Mexican pesos and we sell our production in United States dollars, we are subject to changes in currency values that may adversely affect our results of operations. Our operations in the future could be affected by changes in the value of the Mexican peso against the United States dollar. The appreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies such as the peso against the U.S. dollar increases expenses and the cost of purchasing capital assets in U.S. dollar terms in Mexico, which can adversely impact our operating results and cash flows. Conversely, depreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies usually decreases operating costs and capital asset purchases in U.S. dollar terms. The value of cash and cash equivalents, and other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, also fluctuate with changes in currency exchange rates.\nFor fiscal year 2020, approximately 17% of our consolidated net revenues were derived from product sales to international customers. A number of risks are inherent in international transactions. International sales and operations may be limited or disrupted by any of the following:\n\u2022regulatory approval process,\n\u2022government controls,\n\u2022export license requirements,\n\u2022political instability,\n\u2022price controls,\n\u2022trade restrictions,\n\u2022fluctuations in foreign currencies,\n\u2022changes in tariffs, or\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing international operations.\nForeign regulatory agencies have or may establish product standards different from those in the United States, and any inability on our part to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our international business, and our financial condition and results of operations. While our foreign sales are currently priced in dollars, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may reduce the demand for our products by increasing the price of our products in the currency of the countries in which the products are sold. Regulatory, geopolitical and other factors may adversely impact our operations in the future or require us to modify our current business practices.\nOur dependence on single-source suppliers and service providers may cause disruption in our operations should any supplier fail to deliver materials\nSeveral of the raw materials we use to manufacture our products are currently purchased from a single source, including some monomers used to synthesize Intelimer polymers, substrate materials for our breathable membrane products, and raw materials for our HA products. In addition, several services that are provided to Curation Foods are obtained from a single provider. Any interruption of our relationship with single-source suppliers or service providers could delay product shipments and materially harm our business. We may experience difficulty acquiring materials or services for the manufacture of our products or we may not be able to obtain substitute vendors at all or on a timely basis. In addition, we may not be able to procure comparable materials at similar prices and terms within a reasonable time, if at all, all of which could materially harm our business.\nWe depend on our infrastructure to have sufficient capacity to handle our on-going production needs\nIf our machinery or facilities are damaged or impaired due to natural disasters or mechanical failure, or we lose members of our workforce beyond the levels needed to maintain our business, we may not be able to operate at a sufficient capacity to meet our production needs. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, which could impact our results of operations and our financial condition.\nWe depend on strategic partners and licenses for future development\nOur strategy for development, clinical and field testing, manufacture, commercialization and marketing for some of our current and future products includes entering into various collaborations with corporate partners, licensees, and others. We are dependent on our corporate partners to develop, test, manufacture and/or market some of our products. Although we believe that our partners in these collaborations have an economic motivation to succeed in performing their contractual responsibilities, the amount and timing of resources to be devoted to these activities are not within our control. Our partners may not perform their obligations as expected or we may not derive any additional revenue from the arrangements. Our partners may not pay any additional option or license fees to us or may not develop, market or pay any royalty fees related to products under such agreements. Moreover, some of the collaborative agreements provide that they may be terminated at the discretion of the corporate partner, and some of the collaborative agreements provide for termination under other circumstances. Our partners may pursue existing or alternative technologies in preference to our technology. Furthermore, we may not be able to negotiate additional collaborative arrangements in the future on acceptable terms, if at all, and our collaborative arrangements may not be successful.\nOur reputation and business may be harmed if our computer network security or any of the databases containing our trade secrets, proprietary information or the personal information of our employees are compromised\nCyber-attacks or security breaches could compromise our confidential business information, cause a disruption in the Company\u2019s operations or harm our reputation. We maintain numerous information assets, including intellectual property, trade secrets, banking information and other sensitive information critical to the operation and success of our business on computer networks, and such information may be compromised in the event that the security of such networks is breached. We also maintain confidential information regarding our employees and job applicants, including personal identification information. The protection of employee and company data in the information technology systems we utilize (including those maintained by third-party providers) is critical. Despite the efforts by us to secure computer networks utilized for our business, security could be compromised, confidential information, such as Company information assets and personally identifiable employee information, could be misappropriated, or system disruptions could occur.\nIn addition, we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyberattacks. Attacks may be targeted at us, our customers, or others who have entrusted us with information. Actual or anticipated attacks may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect sensitive Company data being breached or compromised. Furthermore, actual or anticipated cyberattacks or data breaches may cause significant disruptions to our network operations, which may impact our ability to deliver shipments or respond to customer needs in a timely or efficient manner.\nData and security breaches could also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including an intentional or inadvertent breach by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of confidential information related to our business or personal information of our employees. Any compromise or breach of our computer network security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, costly investigations and litigation, and potential regulatory or other actions by governmental agencies. As a result of any of the foregoing, we could experience adverse publicity, the compromise of valuable information assets, loss of sales, the cost of remedial measures and/or significant expenditures to reimburse third parties for resulting damages, any of which could adversely impact our brand, our business and our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or may infringe intellectual property rights of others\nWe may receive notices from third parties, including some of our competitors, claiming infringement by our products of their patent and other proprietary rights. Regardless of their merit, responding to any such claim could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and require us to enter royalty and licensing agreements which may not be offered or available on terms acceptable to us. If a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology, we could be required to alter our products or processes and our business, results of operations or financial position could be materially adversely affected. Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain patents, maintain trade secret protection, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties. Any pending patent applications we file may not be approved and we may not be able to develop additional proprietary products that are patentable. Any patents issued to us may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties. Patents held by others may prevent the commercialization of products incorporating our technology. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar products, duplicate our products or design around our patents.\nThe global economy is experiencing continued volatility, which may have an adverse effect on our business\nIn recent years, the U.S. and international economy and financial markets have experienced significant volatility due to uncertainties related to the availability of credit, energy prices, the COVID-19 pandemic, national elections and other political events, difficulties in the banking and financial services sectors, diminished market liquidity, and geopolitical conflicts. Ongoing volatility in the economy and financial markets could further lead to reduced demand for our products, which in turn, would reduce our revenues and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, volatility in the global markets have resulted in softer demand and more conservative purchasing decisions by customers, including a tendency toward lower-priced products, which could negatively impact our revenues, gross margins and results of operations. In addition to a reduction in sales, our profitability may decrease because we may not be able to reduce costs at the same rate as our sales decline. We cannot predict the ultimate severity or length of the current period of volatility, or the timing or severity of future economic or industry downturns.\nGiven the current uncertain economic environment, and the COVID-19 pandemic, our customers, suppliers, and partners may have difficulties obtaining capital at adequate or historical levels to finance their ongoing business and operations, which could impair their ability to make timely payments to us. This may result in lower sales and/or inventory that may not be saleable or may result in bad debt expenses for us. A worsening of the economic environment or continued or increased volatility of the U.S. economy, including increased volatility in the credit markets, could adversely impact our customers\u2019 and vendors\u2019 ability or willingness to conduct business with us on the same terms or at the same levels as they have historically. Further, this economic volatility and uncertainty about future economic conditions makes it challenging for Landec to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify the risks that may affect its business, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur stock price may fluctuate in response to various conditions, many of which are beyond our control\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u2022weather-related produce sourcing issues,\n\u2022technological innovations applicable to our products,\n\u2022pandemics, epidemics and other natural disasters, including the COVID-19 pandemic,\n\u2022our attainment of (or failure to attain) milestones in the commercialization of our technology,\n\u2022our development of new products or the development of new products by our competitors,\n\u2022new patents or changes in existing patents applicable to our products,\n\u2022our acquisition of new businesses or the sale or disposal of a part of our businesses,\n\u2022development of new collaborative arrangements by us, our competitors or other parties,\n\u2022changes in government regulations, interpretation, or enforcement applicable to our business,\n\u2022changes in investor perception of our business,\n\u2022fluctuations in our operating results, and\n\u2022changes in the general market conditions in our industry.\nFluctuations in our quarterly results may, particularly if unforeseen, cause us to miss projections which might result in analysts or investors changing their valuation of our stock.\nLitigation costs and the outcome of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business\nFrom time to time we may be subject to litigation claims through the ordinary course of our business operations regarding, but not limited to, employment matters, safety standards, product liability, security of customer and employee personal information, contractual relations with vendors, marketing and infringement of trademarks and other intellectual property rights. In addition, as described elsewhere in this report, the COVID-19 pandemic, and our responses thereto, may subject us to further litigation, including with respect to employment matters, contract disputes, and other matters. Litigation to defend ourselves against claims by third parties, or to enforce any rights that we may have against third parties, may continue to be necessary, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nLapses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations, profitability or reputation\nLapses or deficiencies in disclosure controls and procedures or in our internal control over financial reporting may occur from time to time. There can be no assurance that our disclosure controls and procedures will be effective in preventing a material weakness or significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting from occurring in the future. Any such lapses or deficiencies may materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations or financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend resources to correct the lapses or deficiencies, which could include the restating of previously reported financial results, expose us to regulatory or legal proceedings, harm our reputation, or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.\nWe may issue preferred stock with preferential rights that could affect your rights\nThe issuance of shares of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third-party to acquire a majority of our outstanding stock, and the holders of such preferred stock could have voting, dividend, liquidation and other rights superior to those of holders of our Common Stock.\nWe have never paid any dividends on our common stock\nWe have not paid any dividends on our Common Stock since inception and do not expect to in the foreseeable future. Any dividends may be subject to preferential dividends payable on any preferred stock we may issue.\nOur corporate organizational documents and Delaware law have anti-takeover provisions that may inhibit or prohibit a takeover of us and the replacement or removal of our management\nThe anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, as well as the provisions contained in our corporate organizational documents, may make an acquisition of us more difficult. For example:\n\u2022our certificate of incorporation includes a provision authorizing our Board of Directors to issue blank check preferred stock without stockholder approval, which, if issued, would increase the number of outstanding shares of our capital stock and could make it more difficult for a stockholder to acquire us;\n\u2022our certificate of incorporation provides for a dual-class Board of Directors, in which each class will serve for a staggered two-year term;\n\u2022our certificate of incorporation limits the number of directors that may serve on the Board of Directors without the majority approval of all of the outstanding shares of our common stock;\n\u2022our amended and restated bylaws require advance notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations;\n\u2022our Board of Directors has the right to implement additional anti-takeover protections in the future, including stockholder rights plans and other amendments to our organizational documents, without stockholder approval; and\n\u2022Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may prevent large stockholders from completing a merger or acquisition of us.\nThese provisions may prevent a merger or acquisition of us which could limit the price investors would pay for our common stock in the future.", "PERMNO": 83148, "SIC": 2033, "TIC": "LNDC"}
