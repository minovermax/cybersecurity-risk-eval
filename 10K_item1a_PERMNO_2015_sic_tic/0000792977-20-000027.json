{"cik": "792977", "company": "AMAG PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-06", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS:\nThe following information sets forth material risks and uncertainties that may affect our business, including our future financial and operational results and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and elsewhere as discussed in the introduction to Part I above. You should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before making an investment decision. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to present material risks to our business at this time also may impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThere can be no assurance that our recently announced strategic review will result in a successful transaction for the divestiture of Intrarosa and Vyleesi or that any such transaction would create any shareholder value. Speculation and uncertainty regarding our decision to divest our women\u2019s health business and the outcome of our actions may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nIn January 2020, we announced that we had recently completed a review of our product portfolio and strategy and had engaged Goldman Sachs and Co., LLC as our financial advisor to assist us in identifying and evaluating a range of potential strategic alternatives with the objective of driving near- and long-term profitability and enhancing shareholder value. As a result of this strategic review, we are currently pursuing options for divesting Intrarosa\u00ae (prasterone) and Vyleesi\u00ae (bremelanotide injection). There can be no assurances that we will identify or effect any transaction to divest Intrarosa or Vyleesi in the expected timeframe, or at all, or that any transaction will be on terms that are favorable to us or that yield any value for shareholders. Further, we cannot assure investors that the anticipated benefits of eliminating these assets from our portfolio, including anticipated expense reductions, will be realized at expected levels, or at all. Identifying and completing any potential transaction would be dependent on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, among other things, market conditions, third-party consents, the interest of third parties in a potential transaction with us on terms that are acceptable and the availability of financing for potential buyers on reasonable terms, if required. If we fail to consummate a transaction to sell or otherwise divest Intrarosa and Vyleesi or if such transaction is significantly delayed beyond our expected timeline, our results of operations may be adversely affected or we may not be able to adequately fund our clinical development programs on the anticipated timelines, or at all.\nThe process of divesting Intrarosa and Vyleesi has been and will continue to be time consuming and disruptive to our business operations and could have a negative impact on our revenues or stock price for the following reasons:\n\u2022\nThe expected changes to our sales force as a result of the divestiture of Intrarosa and Vyleesi could negatively impact our revenue, including sales of Makena;\n\u2022\nWe could also be exposed to potential litigation in connection with this process, including any resulting transaction;\n\u2022\nWe could incur substantial expenses associated with identifying, evaluating and effecting a divestiture, including those related to severance pay, vendor minimum commitments, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees and other fees or costs that may be payable regardless of whether we successfully divest these assets;\n\u2022\nWe experience a negative impact on our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel;\n\u2022\nSome of our customers and vendors for Intrarosa and Vyleesi are also customers and vendors for our other products, and we may experience changes in pricing with these parties as a result of the decreased products and volume;\n\u2022\nSpeculation regarding any developments related to the review of strategic alternatives, our plans to divest Intrarosa and Vyleesi and any other perceived uncertainties related to the future of our company; and\n\u2022\nThe attention of management and the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d) is diverted from our business.\nFollowing the planned divestiture of our women\u2019s health business and because of the uncertainty surrounding Makena, our business will be significantly dependent upon sales of Feraheme, which faces intense competition from other IV irons, and may also face competition from generic versions of Feraheme.\nFollowing the planned divestiture of our women\u2019s health business and because of the uncertainty surrounding Makena, our business will be significantly dependent upon sales of Feraheme. Our ability to generate sufficient sales of Feraheme will require us to maintain or grow our market share and the continued use of Feraheme, including use by physicians, hospitals, patients, and/or healthcare payers, including government payers, consumers, managed care organizations, and retail and specialty pharmacies. We are likely to face challenges retaining our existing Feraheme customers, gaining sales to new customers and maintaining our market share in light of the intense competition primarily from other IV irons, pricing pressure from payers and deeper discounts, and the possibility that we may face competition from a generic version of Feraheme.\nFeraheme competes primarily with Injectafer\u00ae and Venofer\u00ae, which together currently make up greater than 50% of the market (measured in grams of IV iron). These and other competitors of Feraheme are marketed by large pharmaceutical companies and may benefit from significantly greater financial, sales and marketing capabilities, greater technological or competitive advantages, and other resources. In addition, we expect to face further competition from Pharmacosmos A/S\u2019s Monoferric\u00ae (ferric derisomaltose), which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the \u201cFDA\u201d) in January 2020 for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia (\u201cIDA\u201d) in adult patients who have intolerance to oral iron or have had unsatisfactory response to oral iron or who have non-hemodialysis dependent chronic kidney disease. Monoferric\u00ae is administered in a single-dose and does not contain a boxed warning, which healthcare providers or patients may prefer over Feraheme.\nFurther, our Feraheme revenues will be materially and adversely affected if a generic version of ferumoxytol is introduced to the market earlier than the expiration of our patents. In March 2018, we and Sandoz Inc. (\u201cSandoz\u201d) entered a stipulation of dismissal pursuant to a settlement agreement that dismissed and resolved a patent infringement suit regarding an abbreviated new drug application (an \u201cANDA\u201d) submitted to the FDA by Sandoz. As part of the settlement agreement, we waived any regulatory exclusivities granted by the FDA that would prevent or hinder approval of the Sandoz generic product. The settlement agreement further stipulated that, upon request from Sandoz, we would provide the FDA with a written confirmation of such waiver, which Sandoz recently requested and we provided. According to the terms of the settlement, if Sandoz receives FDA approval of its ANDA by a certain date stipulated in the settlement agreement, Sandoz may launch its generic version of Feraheme on July 15, 2021. Further, if Sandoz is unable to secure FDA approval of its ANDA by that certain date, Sandoz will be permitted to sell an authorized generic version of Feraheme supplied by us beginning on July 15, 2022 for up to 12 months. We have been working with Sandoz as they conduct quality diligence in preparation for this potential authorized generic partnership with us, which, if triggered under the terms of the settlement agreement, could potentially be disruptive to Feraheme.\nIf our sales are adversely impacted by the increasingly competitive landscape for Feraheme, including if Sandoz launches a generic formulation of Feraheme, we may have insufficient revenues and cash flows to service our indebtedness and/or support our development-stage products, which would have a material and negative impact on our long-term business and viability.\nMakena revenue and our results of operations will be materially adversely impacted if the FDA withdraws Makena\u2019s approval or changes its label or if healthcare providers are reluctant to continue prescribing Makena due to the results of the PROLONG trial and the recommendations of the Advisory Committee, including to withdraw the approval of Makena.\nIn March 2019, we announced topline results from the Progestin\u2019s Role in Optimizing Neonatal Gestation clinical (\u201cPROLONG\u201d or \u201cTrial 003\u201d), which evaluated Makena in patients with a history of a prior spontaneous singleton preterm delivery. The PROLONG trial was conducted under the FDA\u2019s \u201cSubpart H\u201d accelerated approval process to confirm the efficacy of the Meis trial (\u201cTrial 002\u201d), which supported Makena\u2019s 2011 FDA approval. The PROLONG trial results did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the treatment and placebo arms for the co-primary endpoints.\nOn October 29, 2019, the FDA\u2019s Bone, Reproductive and Urologic Drugs Advisory Committee (the \u201cAdvisory Committee\u201d) met to discuss the PROLONG study and provide the FDA input to inform the FDA\u2019s regulatory decision for Makena. At the conclusion of the meeting, nine members of the Advisory Committee voted to recommend that the FDA withdraw its approval of Makena, seven voted to leave Makena on the market under accelerated approval and require a new confirmatory trial and no member voted to leave Makena on the market without requiring a new confirmatory trial. While the Advisory Committee\u2019s recommendations are not binding, those recommendations will be considered by the FDA in deciding what regulatory steps to take with respect to Makena, which could result in a formal administrative hearing and/or withdraw the approval of Makena. The FDA\u2019s decision may be further influenced by a recently filed Citizen Petition, which requested that the FDA withdraw its approval of Makena based on the failure of the Makena clinical data to establish evidence of efficacy for preterm birth. Although we responded to the Citizen Petition by providing the FDA with arguments to support the positive benefit-risk profile of Makena, we can provide no assurance that the FDA will agree with our position. If the FDA withdraws its\napproval of Makena, our revenues and results of operations will be materially and adversely impacted, including due to the potential recognition of additional revenue reserves, inventory write-downs and payments for minimum purchase obligations of inventory. Even if the FDA were to decide against withdrawal of Makena from the market at this time, it is likely that the FDA would require us to generate additional data or conduct additional clinical trials as a condition to Makena\u2019s continued commercialization. We may not be able to generate additional efficacy data that will be satisfactory to the FDA in a timely manner, or at all, and the generation of such data is likely to be costly and take a considerable amount of time to generate. Further, other organizations have conducted and may conduct additional studies that result in findings similar to those in the PROLONG study, which may influence the decisions and guidance provided by healthcare physicians or professional organizations related to the use of Makena. Additionally, in light of the results from the PROLONG study, including discussions and recommendations of the Advisory Committee and pending the FDA\u2019s regulatory decision, healthcare providers have been and may continue to be reluctant to continue prescribing Makena, or the FDA may require that our label include information on the PROLONG study, restrictions to the current indication or the insertion of new warnings or precautions. Further, in light of the recommendation of the Advisory Committee that the FDA withdraw the approval of Makena, certain medical professional organizations and other societies could change their guidelines to physicians, which could cause payors to change the formulary coverage or reimbursement for Makena or health care practitioners could stop prescribing Makena. Any of these outcomes could negatively impact or prevent our ability to commercialize Makena, would materially and adversely impact our results of operations and could materially and adversely impact our stock price.\nThe commercial success of Makena (if approval is not ultimately withdrawn by the FDA) is exclusively dependent upon sales from the pre-filled subcutaneous auto-injector (the \u201cMakena auto-injector\u201d). Although there is no direct competition with the Makena auto-injector, the Makena auto-injector competes for the same patients as generic versions of the Makena intramuscular (\u201cIM\u201d) injection (the \u201cMakena IM product\u201d) and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to convince patients or healthcare providers to use or to switch from using the IM method of administration to the auto-injector, including (1) if patients or healthcare providers are hesitant or apprehensive to use an auto-injector product due to perceptions regarding safety, efficacy or pain associated with the Makena auto-injector, or in light of the recommendations of the Advisory Committee or any actions taken by the FDA that negatively impact Makena, (2) if the auto-injector is not priced competitively or is not provided comparable insurance coverage, or (3) if there are concerns about our Makena supply chain more generally in light of the previous supply disruptions related to our Makena IM products or if we experience a similar supply disruption for the Makena auto-injector. We expect that the Makena auto-injector may continue to experience pricing and supply chain pressure (if approval is not ultimately withdrawn by the FDA) and as a result, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. If we are unsuccessful with any such efforts, Makena revenues could continue to be negatively and materially impacted, which could have a material and negative impact on our stock price and results of operations.\nFurther, we have incurred considerable expenses and our revenues have suffered as a result of the Makena IM supply disruption. We expect to continue to incur expenses as we pursue our remedies for these losses, including under our supply agreement with our third party manufacturer of the Makena IM products, which is costly to pursue and may not result in satisfactory, adequate or any compensation for the damages we suffered.\nWe may not be able to achieve and/or maintain profitability.\nIn recent years, our business strategy has gone through considerable transformation, and is expected to go through further changes as we pursue options for divesting Intrarosa and Vyleesi and reduce expenses related to Makena in light of the recommendations of the Advisory Committee and as we face competition, including from the generic market for Makena and potentially for Feraheme. As a result of these developments, we will become increasingly reliant on the Feraheme business to support our operations, including the significant resources which will be required to develop and commercialize AMAG-423 and ciraparantag, which is a lengthy and expensive process, before our product candidates might generate revenues, if at all. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses as we continue to develop AMAG-423 and ciraparantag. As a result of these substantial expenditures, we will need to generate sufficient revenues and/or access external sources of capital in future periods in order to develop our pipeline and maintain or increase our commercial footprint. Our ability to realize our near- and long-term goals, including achieving and maintaining profitability and positive cash flows, will depend in large part on our ability to manage our expenses and maintain or grow Feraheme, as well as numerous other factors including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nOur ability to fund the development AMAG-423 and ciraparantag, progress our clinical development programs in a timely and cost-effective manner, and obtain FDA approval for these and any other products we might develop or acquire, in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\nWhether we can reach agreement with the FDA on a path to continue to make Makena commercially available, despite the recommendations of the Advisory Committee;\n\u2022\nOur ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approval for our current and future products or product candidates and whether the FDA imposes any restrictions on the use or distribution of any approved products or other adverse regulatory actions;\n\u2022\nThe competitive landscape for our products, including the timing of new competing products (including generics) entering the market, and the level and speed at which competing products (current or new) experience market acceptance;\n\u2022\nThe relative price, constraints on pricing and the impact of price increases on our products, including the financial impact of certain programs we may implement and a recent increase in consolidation of pharmacy benefit managers (\u201cPBM\u201d) and managed care organizations;\n\u2022\nThe effectiveness of our marketing, sales and distribution strategies and operations and our ability to leverage our established relationships in the medical community and expand our access through contracting strategies;\n\u2022\nActual or perceived advantages or disadvantages of our products or product candidates as compared to alternative treatments, including their respective safety and efficacy profiles, potential convenience and ease of administration or cost effectiveness;\n\u2022\nOur and our partners\u2019 ability to enforce intellectual property rights in and to our products to prohibit a third-party from marketing a competing product (including a generic product) and our ability to avoid third-party patent interference or intellectual property infringement claims;\n\u2022\nOur ability to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities to meet demand, including maintaining commercially viable manufacturing processes that are compliant with applicable laws and regulations (including current good manufacturing practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d));\n\u2022\nThe impact of new safety or drug interaction issues that could arise as our products are used or studied over longer periods of time or used by a wider group of patients, some of whom may be taking other medicines or have additional underlying health problems;\n\u2022\nOur ability to satisfactorily meet confirmatory trial requirements for drugs approved via the accelerated approval pathway;\n\u2022\nOur ability to secure and maintain adequate reimbursement from insurance companies, government programs and third-party payers to optimize patient access and the willingness and ability of patients to pay for our products, including the willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products if more economical options are available; and\n\u2022\nOur ability to maintain favorable, and to identify, assess and consummate potential, partnering relationships for our products and product candidates.\nWe may also encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business. There is no guarantee that we will generate sufficient revenues to support our business, or that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability, if achieved, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to achieve positive cash flow from operations or generate sufficient cash to service our outstanding debt. If we are not successful in marketing and selling our products, particularly Feraheme, if revenues decrease below expectations, if our product candidates are not approved, if our operating expenses exceed our expectations, or if we are otherwise unable to achieve, maintain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected and the market price of our common stock may decline.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service all of our indebtedness and other obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $320.0 million of total debt outstanding consisting of our convertible notes due June 1, 2022 bearing interest at 3.25% annually (the \u201c2022 Convertible Notes\u201d) and approximately $171.8 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nWe generated negative cash flows from operations during the year ended December 31, 2019 and while we expect to generate positive cash flows from continuing operations during 2020, these cash flows and our cash and cash equivalents on\nhand in the aggregate will be insufficient to cash settle our 2022 Convertible Notes. We therefore expect that we will need to issue new securities, in the form of debt, equity or equity-linked, or some combination thereof. We may also utilize proceeds from a potential strategic collaboration or other transaction to manage our existing obligations.\nOur ability to manage our debt obligations depends on our future performance, as well as economic, financial, competitive and other factors that may be beyond our control, including conditions in the debt and equity markets. Each of the alternatives described above, could carry onerous terms and may be highly dilutive to our stockholders. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default of our 2022 Convertible Notes obligations. In addition, if for any reason we are unable to meet our debt service and repayment obligations, we could be in breach of other agreements.\nFurther, holders of the 2022 Convertible Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (which includes certain change of control transactions, stockholder-approved liquidations and dissolutions and certain stock exchange delisting events) at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Upon conversion of the 2022 Convertible Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of the 2022 Convertible Notes upon an occurrence of a fundamental change. Further, because the indentures governing the 2022 Convertible Notes require that we elect the method by which we will settle conversions significantly in advance of when we are required to deliver the conversion consideration, we may not have sufficient cash available or be able to obtain financing at the time we are ultimately required to settle the 2022 Convertible Notes. Our failure to repurchase the 2022 Convertible Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture or to pay any cash payable on future conversions of the 2022 Convertible Notes would constitute an event of default.\nWe have limited experience with development stage products and cannot ensure that we will be successful in gaining approval of our product candidates, AMAG-423 and ciraparantag, or any product candidates that may be added to our pipeline, on a timely basis, or at all, and even if approved, we may not be successful in commercializing such products. Additionally, any approvals that we do obtain may contain unexpected FDA-imposed restrictions on the use or distribution of such products, which could adversely and materially affect our long-term success.\nOur long-term success and ability to sustain and grow revenue depends upon our ability to continue to successfully develop our product candidates. Drug development is inherently risky, time consuming, unpredictable and costly. The FDA imposes substantial requirements on the development of such candidates to become eligible for marketing approval and has substantial discretion in the approval process.\nWe currently have two product candidates in our pipeline: AMAG-423, which is in development for the treatment of severe preeclampsia, and ciraparantag, which is in development for patients treated with novel oral anticoagulants or low molecular weight heparin when reversal of the anticoagulant effect of these products is needed for emergency surgery, urgent procedures or due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding.\nThe approval of our current or future product candidates for commercial sale in the U.S. could be delayed, limited or denied or we may be required to conduct additional studies for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, that:\n\u2022\nThe FDA may determine that our product candidates do not demonstrate safety and efficacy in accordance with regulatory agency standards based on a number of considerations, including adverse medical events that are reported during the trials;\n\u2022\nThe FDA could analyze and/or interpret data from clinical trials and preclinical testing in different ways than we or our partners interpret them and determine that our data is insufficient for approval;\n\u2022\nThe FDA may require more information, including additional preclinical or clinical data or trials, to support approval;\n\u2022\nDevices we may use in combination with our products may not be adequate or may not be considered adequate by the FDA, such as the coagulometer we intend to use in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical programs for ciraparantag;\n\u2022\nThe FDA could determine that our manufacturing processes are not properly designed, are not conducted in accordance with federal laws or otherwise not properly managed and we may be unable to establish, and obtain FDA approval for, a commercially viable manufacturing process for our product candidates in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022\nThe supply or quality of our product candidates for our clinical trials may be insufficient, inadequate or delayed, particularly with respect to AMAG-423, which is a biologic and involves a time intensive, complex manufacturing process;\n\u2022\nThe size of the patient population required to establish the efficacy of our product candidates to the satisfaction of the FDA may be larger than we anticipated;\n\u2022\nThe failure of clinical investigational sites and the records kept at such sites, including the clinical trial data, to be in compliance with the FDA\u2019s current good clinical practices regulations (\u201ccGCP\u201d), including the failure to pass FDA inspections of clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nThe FDA may change their approval policies or adopt new regulations;\n\u2022\nThe FDA may not be able to undertake reviews or approval processes in a timely fashion;\n\u2022\nThe results of the earlier clinical trials may not be representative of our future, larger trials, particularly since the presumed mechanism of action for certain of our products is not known or understood; for instance ciraparantag has only been studied in a small number of healthy volunteers;\n\u2022\nThe FDA may not agree with our regulatory approval strategies or components of our regulatory filings, such as the design or implementation of our clinical trials; for instance, we are relying on precedent to estimate the number of patients required in our Phase 3b ciraparantag trial prior to filing the New Drug Application (\u201cNDA\u201d), and the FDA may not agree with our approach and our other expectations for these clinical trials may not ultimately be approved by the FDA; or\n\u2022\nA product may not be approved for the indications that we request.\nFurther, we have identified the following risks, which are specific to a particular development program:\nAMAG-423\n\u2022\nAMAG-423 is produced through a time intensive, complex process and there is currently only one third-party that can manufacture it, as further discussed below;\n\u2022\nThe Phase 2b/3a trial may produce negative or inconclusive results or may not demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction that AMAG-423 is safe and effective, particularly in light of the limited amount of data to date demonstrating that AMAG-423 effectively treats severe preeclampsia in this patient population;\n\u2022\nPatient enrollment has been slower than expected and is likely to continue to be a slow process as severe preeclampsia can be a difficult patient population to enroll. For example, although we have expanded and continue to expand the trial sites to accelerate enrollment, enrollment continues to be slow and may take longer than expected for any number of factors, including failure of our third-party vendors (including our CROs) to effectively perform their obligations to us in a timely manner, a lack of patients who meet the enrollment criteria, our inability to establish sufficient trial sites, including outside of the U.S. due to regulatory requirements, in a timely manner, or our inability to secure sufficient supply of drug product to meet the clinical timeline due to the large number of global sites;\n\u2022\nUnder our agreement with BTG plc, we are required to differentiate our product from their product DigiFab\u00ae including without limitation, via labeling, dosage and/or formulation and if we are unable to show differentiation, we may be in breach of the agreement, which could give BTG the right to terminate the agreement and subject us to penalties; and\n\u2022\nThere is no FDA-approved treatment for severe preeclampsia and accordingly, there is not an established regulatory pathway, which may require us to conduct additional trials or otherwise delay the approval of AMAG-423.\nCiraparantag\n\u2022\nThe timing and/or complexity of our upcoming Phase 2b study could be negatively impacted for a number of reasons, including if (i) the FDA requires us to use a manual whole blood clotting time (\u201cWBCT\u201d) in addition to the automated coagulometer; (ii) the FDA requires us to explore additional dosing; (iii) we do not get agreement from the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (\u201cCDER\u201d) on our Phase 2b protocol in a timely manner, which would delay the Investigational Device Exception (\u201cIDE\u201d) submission timeline; or (iv) if the validation studies required by the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (\u201cCDRH\u201d) to obtain the IDE for the coagulometer take longer than anticipated;\n\u2022\nThe coagulometer that we intend to use in the ciraparantag Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials has not yet received IDE approval or been used in clinical trials and therefore, the FDA may (i) determine that the device is not effective in measuring WBCT, and/or (ii) not grant the IDE, which is necessary prior to the use of the coagulometer in our clinical trials; in such circumstances, ciraparantag may not receive regulatory approval or its approval would be delayed. Moreover, the FDA may only approve ciraparantag in conjunction with the use of the coagulometer (i.e. as a companion diagnostic), which could affect the commercial viability of ciraparantag;\n\u2022\nOur NDA filing for ciraparantag could be delayed if (i) we are not able to gain agreement with the FDA on CMC, clinical pharmacology or our pre-clinical program at our End of Phase 2 meeting, including having to conduct potential additional trials prior to commencing the Phase 3 program; (ii) if we are not eligible for the accelerated approval pathway or the FDA requires more patient data before filing than anticipated; or (iii) if the FDA requires additional Phase 3 trials.\n\u2022\nEven if approved, ciraparantag may not be approved with all three novel oral anticoagulants (\u201cNOACs\u201d) as well as Lovenox\u00ae (enoxaparin sodium injection), a low molecular weight heparin (\u201cLMWH\u201d), which could affect market acceptance and revenue.\nIn addition, AMAG-423 has received orphan drug designation from the FDA and we are pursuing orphan drug designation for ciraparantag. Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may designate a product candidate as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined, in part, as a patient population of fewer than 200,000. The company that first obtains FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for the specified rare disease or condition receives orphan drug marketing exclusivity for that drug for a period of seven years. We cannot guarantee that our clinical data or other information that we generate or submit will be adequate for AMAG-423 or ciraparantag to receive orphan drug exclusivity. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA may subsequently approve another drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the latter drug is not the same drug or is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity marketing rights may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. If we do not receive orphan drug designation or orphan drug exclusivity, or if the FDA approves another drug for the same indication, we may have limited market exclusivity for these products, especially AMAG-423, which has limited patent protection.\nAny failure, delay or setback in obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates, or setback resulting from our inability to sufficiently fund or otherwise support our pipeline, could adversely affect our ability to grow our business and leverage our product portfolio, and the future prospects of our business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, share prices have declined significantly in certain instances where companies have failed to obtain FDA approval of a product or where the timing of FDA approval is delayed. If we are required to conduct additional studies or our studies take longer than anticipated, our share price could decline significantly. Further, the market for products that address unmet medical needs is highly speculative and if we have over-estimated the market opportunity for any of our products or product candidates, or if we are unsuccessful in gaining market share, then our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nEven if regulatory approval is granted by the FDA to market our current or future product candidates, the FDA may impose limitations on the indicated use for which the drug product may be marketed or require additional post-approval clinical trials or other requirements with which we would need to comply in order to maintain approval of these products. The occurrence of any of these scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects of our product candidates and our business could be seriously harmed.\nCompetition in the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries, including from companies marketing generic products, is intense. If we fail to compete effectively, our business and market position will suffer.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change. Our existing or potential competitors have or may develop products that are more widely accepted than ours, are viewed as more safe, effective, convenient or easier to administer, have been on the market longer and have stronger patient/provider loyalty, have been approved for a larger patient population, are less expensive or offer more attractive insurance coverage, discounts, reimbursements, incentives or rebates and may have or receive patent protection that dominates, blocks, makes obsolete or adversely affects our product development or business. Any such advantages enjoyed by our competitors could reduce our revenues and the value of our products.\nMany of our competitors for Feraheme are large, well-known pharmaceutical companies and may benefit from significantly greater financial, sales and marketing capabilities, greater technological or competitive advantages, and other resources. Feraheme competes primarily with Injectafer\u00ae, a ferric carboxymaltose injection and Venofer\u00ae, an iron sucrose complex. In January 2020, Monoferric\u00ae (ferric derisomaltose) injection 100 mg/mL was approved by the FDA for the treatment of IDA in adult patients who have who have intolerance to oral iron or have had unsatisfactory response to oral iron or who have non-hemodialysis dependent CKD. Monoferric\u00ae is administered as a single 1,000 mg infusion and does not have a boxed warning. If patients and providers view the single dose infusion of Monoferric\u00ae as a more convenient option than treatment with Feraheme, our Feraheme sales could be negatively impacted as Monoferric\u00ae becomes more widely available in the U.S. In addition, there are a number of oral iron replacement therapies either approved, such as Auryxia\u00ae (ferric citrate), an oral phosphate binder, or in development, such as and hypoxia inducible factor stabilizers.\nMakena competition currently comes mainly from five independent generic formulations of hydroxyprogesterone caproate (\u201cHPC\u201d) injections, as well as from pharmacies that compound a non-FDA approved version of Makena, all of which are sold at much lower list prices than our branded products. We also expect to continue to face competition for Makena from future generic products as well as products currently in development which offer additional formulations or routes of administration that doctors believe may reduce or prevent preterm birth, such as an oral HPC product.\nCurrently, the primary pharmaceutical competitor we expect ciraparantag, if approved, to compete with is Andexxa\u00ae (coagulation factor Xa (recombinant), inactivated-zhzo), which was approved in 2018 in the U.S. for the reversal of Xarelto\u00ae(rivaroxaban) and Eliquis\u00ae(apixaban), when reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding, as well as in 2019 in Europe (under the trade name Ondexxya\u2122). Andexxa\u00ae is also in development for the reversal of Savaysa\u00ae(edoxaban) and Lovenox\u00ae (enoxaparin sodium injection).\nIntrarosa faces competition from a number of approved products, both branded and generic, as well as certain over the counter and compounded remedies that are marketed for dyspareunia and over the counter and compounded products that contain dehydroepiandrosterone. The actual market size and market dynamics for moderate to severe dyspareunia due to menopause is uncertain. While we believe that Intrarosa, as the only FDA-approved, non-estrogen-containing vaginal insert to treat moderate to severe dyspareunia, has competitive advantages compared to estrogen-containing therapies, we may not be able to realize this perceived advantage in the market. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced if physicians or patients perceive that other products are more effective, convenient or safer than Intrarosa, or if they are less expensive than Intrarosa.\nVyleesi faces competition primarily from Addyi\u00ae(flibanserin), an FDA-approved product for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (\u201cHSDD\u201d) in pre-menopausal women as a daily-use oral drug. In addition, we are aware of several other drugs at various stages of development, most of which are being developed to be taken on a chronic, typically once-daily, basis. There may be other companies developing new drugs for female sexual dysfunction (\u201cFSD\u201d) indications other than HSDD, which may compete with Vyleesi, some of which may be in clinical trials in the U.S. or elsewhere. Vyleesi may also compete with products prescribed \u201coff-label\u201d by healthcare providers.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively against existing and future competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. For further details on our competition, please see Item I, \u201cBusiness - Competition.\u201d\nClinical product development involves a lengthy and expensive process, with uncertain timelines and outcomes. Any failure or delay in our clinical development programs could severely harm our business.\nClinical development is expensive, difficult to design and implement, can take multiple years to complete and is inherently uncertain as to the ultimate timelines and outcomes. The results of preclinical testing or human clinical studies may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials and failure can occur at any stage of the clinical development process. We are currently conducting a Phase 2b/3a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study for AMAG-423. We are also planning to initiate a Phase 2b study for ciraparantag and expect to initiate our Phase 3 clinical development program following the completion of the Phase 2b study and an End-of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA. We may experience delays in these ongoing studies or any future clinical studies we or our partners conduct.\nClinical trials can be delayed, suspended or terminated for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nDelay or failure to reach agreement with the FDA on a trial design, particularly with product candidates, such as ciraparantag or AMAG-423, where there is no current FDA-approved treatment and the endpoints in our ongoing AMAG-423 Phase 2b/3a trial have not been used in prior studies;\n\u2022\nDelay or failure to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d) and clinical trial sites, failure by such CROs and trial sites to comply with regulatory requirements or study protocols, or clinical trial sites dropping out of the trial;\n\u2022\nOur inability to manufacture, or obtain from third parties, adequate supply of drug product and substance sufficient to complete our clinical studies;\n\u2022\nDelay or failure in obtaining the necessary approvals from regulators or institutional review boards (\u201cIRBs\u201d), including comparable foreign reviewing entities, in order to commence a clinical trial at a prospective trial site, or their suspension or termination of a clinical trial once commenced;\n\u2022\nImposition of a clinical hold for safety reasons or following an inspection of our or our partners\u2019 clinical trial operations or trial sites by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;\n\u2022\nSlower than expected rate of patient enrollment or difficulty maintaining patients who have initiated participation in a clinical trial or for any post-treatment follow-up;\n\u2022\nProblems with drug product or drug substance storage and distribution;\n\u2022\nDifficultly adding new clinical trial sites on a timely basis, or at all:\n\u2022\nGovernmental or regulatory delays and changes in regulatory requirements, policy and guidelines, including guidelines specifically addressing requirements for the development of treatments for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nAmbiguous or negative interim results, or results that are inconsistent with earlier results or that indicate unforeseen safety or efficacy issues; and\n\u2022\nFeedback from the FDA, an IRB or other entity that requires modification of the study protocol.\nIf we terminate or experience delays in the completion of any of our ongoing or future clinical trials, our already significant development costs may increase, our regulatory approval process could be delayed and our ability to commercialize and commence sales of our product candidates may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our inability to successfully fund and complete clinical studies or trials of our product candidates and demonstrate the efficacy and safety necessary to obtain regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates would significantly harm our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, many of the reasons that cause or lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of our clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates.\nOur portfolio has undergone and is expected to continue to undergo considerable transformation and we may experience difficulties in managing this or future portfolio changes.\nIn recent years, we have considerably expanded our product portfolio with the addition of AMAG-423 and ciraparantag and have also undergone efforts to streamline our business, including with the 2018 sale of our Cord Blood Registry (\u201cCBR\u201d) business and the planned divestiture of our women\u2019s health business. Management, personnel, systems and facilities have had to, and will continue to, undergo considerable changes, and we may not be able to retain or recruit qualified personnel in the future in this competitive environment or to successfully update our systems or processes to adequately support our evolving organization and portfolio changes. To manage this and any future changes effectively, we will be required to continue to manage the sales and marketing efforts for our existing products and the development of our product candidates, conform our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, maintain benefit plans, and establish and increase our access to commercial supplies of our products, which will be challenging and for which we might not be successful. We will be required to right size our facilities, systems and equipment and manage our internal development efforts effectively while complying with our contractual obligations to licensors, licensees, contractors, collaborators, distributors and other third parties. In addition, management may have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from day-to-day activities and towards managing these activities, which could be disruptive to our business. Our future financial performance and our ability to execute on our business plan will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage our recent and future changes. If we experience difficulties or are unsuccessful in managing our limited portfolio and development pipeline, including the impacts of our restructured commercial organization, our results of operations and stock price will be negatively impacted.\nWe are completely dependent on third parties to manufacture our products and any difficulties, disruptions, delays or unexpected costs, or the need to find alternative sources, could adversely affect our results of operations, profitability and future business prospects.\nWe do not own or operate facilities for the manufacture of our commercially distributed products. We rely solely on third-party contract manufacturing organizations (\u201cCMOs\u201d) and our licensors (who, in turn, may also rely on CMOs) to manufacture our products for our commercial and clinical use. We or our licensors may not be able to enter into agreements with manufacturers or second source manufacturers whose facilities and procedures comply with cGMP regulations and other regulatory requirements on a timely basis and with terms that are favorable to us, if at all. Further, our ability to have our products manufactured in sufficient quantities and at acceptable costs to meet our commercial demand and clinical development needs is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our CMO\u2019s and our licensors\u2019 manufacturing facilities. For example, as discussed above, Pfizer, our former primary drug product manufacturer of the Makena IM branded products, experienced manufacturing issues, which resulted in our inability to meet the demand for both our branded Makena IM products and the Makena authorized generic, both of which we ultimately had to discontinue during 2019. Any further or other difficulties, disruptions, or delays in the manufacturing process or supply chain could result in product defects, shipment delays, suspension of manufacturing of, sale of or clinical development for the product, recall or withdrawal of product previously shipped for commercial or clinical purposes, inventory write-offs, or the inability to meet commercial or clinical demand in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nIn some cases, we rely on single source manufacturers without a qualified alternative manufacturer. For example, we only have one manufacturing source for Vyleesi and the Makena auto-injector. We may encounter difficulties in the production of the these or other products, including problems involving quality control, assurance and product reliability. For instance, we have received certain complaints regarding auto-injector malfunction for Makena. These issues as well as potential issues regarding quality control, assurance and product-related scale-up, yields, and manufacturing costs, could result in significant delays in production or our inability to meet our demand for the auto-injector product. Securing additional third-party contract manufacturers will require significant time for validating the necessary manufacturing processes, gaining regulatory approval, and implementing the appropriate oversight and may increase the risk of certain problems, including cost overruns, process reproducibility, stability issues, the inability to deliver required quantities of product that conform to specifications in a timely manner, or the inability to manufacture our products in accordance with cGMP. Furthermore, none of our or our licensors\u2019 current third-party drug product manufacturers supplies to us exclusively and as such they may exhaust some or all of their resources meeting the demand of other parties or themselves.\nFurther, we are completely dependent upon Endoceutics, Inc. (\u201cEndoceutics\u201d) to manufacture commercial supply of Intrarosa, and Endoceutics currently relies on a single CMO for such supply. Although Endoceutics has recently expanded its manufacturing and distribution capabilities, it has limited resources and experience overseeing CMOs and manufacturing products at commercial scale, which involves significant and complex regulatory and compliance obligations. Endoceutics has and is likely to continue to face challenges and difficulties in satisfying such obligations. For example, in September 2019, a Complete Response Letter was received from the FDA in response to our March 2019 regulatory filing to add a manufacturing\nplant owned by Endoceutics, located in Canada, which would act as a second source supplier of Intrarosa. If we and Endoceutics are unable to adequately address the issues raised or provide the information requested by the FDA in a timely manner, or at all, we may experience significant delays in our efforts to obtain approval for the Endoceutics manufacturing plant or may not receive approval at all, which would leave Endoceutics, and ultimately us, entirely dependent upon Endoceutics\u2019 current CMO, which has experienced issues in the past. In addition, Endoceutics has expanded its manufacturing obligations to include supplying their other partners who sell Intrarosa outside the U.S. As a result, Endoceutics could exhaust some or all of their resources meeting the demand of other parties and could fail to provide us with adequate supply of Intrarosa on a timely basis. Any failure of Endoceutics to provide us with sufficient amounts of Intrarosa could result in a shortage of our Intrarosa inventory, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nFurthermore, Endoceutics' assets, including the intellectual property licensed to us, are subject to a security interest held by a third-party lender. Accordingly, if Endoceutics fails to perform its obligations under its loan documents, our rights and remedies under the license agreement may be impaired or inadequate, which could jeopardize our supply of Intrarosa and revenue from the Intrarosa program.\nAMAG-423 is an antibody fragment that is produced through a time intensive, complex process in which immunogens consisting of an analog of digoxin medication are produced and used to immunize sheep, which sheep then produce certain antibodies. These antibodies are collected, separated, purified, and formulated into digoxin immune fab (ovine). As discussed above, there is only one third-party that can manufacture AMAG-423 and which utilizes its own flock of sheep located entirely in Australia for the production of the antibodies used to produce AMAG-423. We currently have a commercial supply agreement to manufacture AMAG-423 drug substance and since there would only be one source of supply, if there are any disruptions to any part of the supply chain process, including the ability to obtain the ovum serum and other raw materials or any issues with the sheep used to produce the antibodies, such as diseases or natural disasters, our ability to complete the Phase 2b/3a trial or commercialize AMAG-423, if approved, would be adversely affected.\nWe currently do not have a commercial drug product supply agreement to manufacture ciraparantag and may not be able to enter into such agreement on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, even if we enter into such agreement, since there would likely only be one source of supply initially, if there are any disruptions to any part of the supply chain process, including the ability to obtain certain raw materials, our ability to complete our planned clinical trials or commercialize ciraparantag, if approved, would be adversely affected.\nFurther, we, our licensors and our respective CMOs currently purchase certain raw and other materials used to manufacture our products from third-party suppliers. These third-party suppliers may cease to produce the raw or other materials used in our products or as part of the administration of our products or otherwise fail to supply these materials to us, our licensors or our respective third-party manufacturers, or fail to supply sufficient quantities of these materials or supply materials that do not conform to specifications to us, our licensors or our respective third-party manufacturers in a timely manner for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nAdverse financial developments at or affecting the supplier;\n\u2022\nUnexpected demand for or shortage of raw or other materials;\n\u2022\nRegulatory requirements or action;\n\u2022\nAn inability to provide timely scheduling and/or sufficient capacity;\n\u2022\nManufacturing difficulties;\n\u2022\nChanges to the specifications of the materials such that they no longer meet our standards;\n\u2022\nLack of sufficient quantities or profit on the production of materials to interest suppliers;\n\u2022\nLabor disputes or shortages;\n\u2022\nFailure to comply with environmental regulations, such as rules and regulations relating to the handling, storage and discharge of hazardous waste;\n\u2022\nChanges in material hazard classification, which could require changes to our manufacturing processes, which, in turn, could require regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nDisruption due to political instability, civil unrest, war or terrorism, or pandemics or other natural disasters; or\n\u2022\nImport or export problems.\nFor example, in December 2019, a novel strain of COVID-19, or coronavirus, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China, the impacts of which are unknown and rapidly evolving. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our ability to procure sufficient supplies for the development and commercialization of our products and product candidates will depend on the severity and duration of the spread of the coronavirus, and the actions undertaken to contain the coronavirus or treat its effects.\nIn addition, we, our licensors or our respective third-party manufacturers sometimes obtain raw or other materials from one vendor only, even where multiple sources are available, to maintain quality control and enhance working relationships with suppliers, which could make us susceptible to price inflation by the sole supplier, thereby increasing our production costs. As a result of the high-quality standards imposed on our raw or other materials, we, our licensors or our respective third-party manufacturers may not be able to obtain such materials of the quality required to manufacture our products from an alternative source on commercially reasonable terms, or in a timely manner, if at all.\nIf, because of the factors discussed above, we are unable to have our products manufactured on a timely or sufficient basis, we may not be able to meet clinical development needs or commercial demand for our products or product candidates or we may not be able to manufacture our products in a cost-effective manner. As a result, we may lose sales, fail to generate projected revenues or suffer development or regulatory setbacks, any of which could have an adverse impact on our profitability and future business prospects.\nThe success of our products depends on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology.\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks and trade secrets in the conduct of our business. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical firms are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We may not be successful or timely in obtaining any patents for which we submit applications or the breadth of the claims obtained in our patents may not provide sufficient protection for our technology. The degree of protection afforded by patents for proprietary or licensed technologies or for future discoveries may not be adequate to preserve our ability to protect or commercially exploit those technologies or discoveries or to prevent others from doing so. The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned or licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the U.S. or abroad. Such challenges may result in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop or prevent us from stopping others from using or commercializing similar or identical technologies and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products. In addition, our owned or licensed intellectual property might be subject to liens or encumbrances, which, as a result, may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from developing and commercializing products similar or identical to ours. Therefore, the degree of protection afforded by our intellectual property may provide us with little or no competitive advantage. For example, digoxin immune fab (ovine), the active ingredient of AMAG-423, has been approved and marketed in the U.S. for many years for a different indication and accordingly, no longer has composition of matter patent protection. If possible, we plan to seek additional patent protection for AMAG-423 through patent applications; however, we may not be able to obtain additional patent protection that would provide us with a competitive advantage.\nWe currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents for our development and commercial products, including the following:\n\u2022\nOne U.S. patent related to Feraheme that will expire in June 2023 and other U.S. patents related to Feraheme that expire in 2020;\n\u2022\nTwo U.S. patents related to the Makena auto-injector product that will expire in 2036;\n\u2022\nFour U.S. patents related to AMAG-423 that will expire in 2022, and several foreign patents that will expire in 2023; and\n\u2022\nTwo U.S. patents related to ciraparantag that will expire in 2032 and 2034, and several foreign patents that will expire in 2032.\nWe also rely on licensed patents for the protection of the products we are commercializing. Under our current license agreements we have rights to a number of U.S. and foreign patents and applications, including the following:\n\u2022\nU.S. and foreign patents and applications licensed from Palatin Technologies, Inc. (\u201cPalatin\u201d) related to Vyleesi that will expire in 2020 (one of which may be extended in the U.S. by up to five years under the Hatch-Waxman Act) and 2033;\n\u2022\nU.S. patents licensed from Endoceutics related to Intrarosa that will expire in 2028 (one of which may be extended by up to five years under the Hatch-Waxman Act) and 2031; and\n\u2022\nU.S. patents licensed from Antares Pharma, Inc. related to the Makena auto-injector product that will expire between 2026 and 2034.\nThese and any other patents owned by or licensed to us may be contested in litigation or reexamined or reviewed by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the \u201cUSPTO\u201d). Even if we come to a mutually acceptable settlement arrangement with an adverse party, we or they may become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny or be subject to formal or informal requests or investigations, including by the FDA, the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission. If any present or future patents relied on for the development or commercialization of our products are narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, this could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nIn addition, although we believe that the patents related to each of our products or product candidates were rightfully issued and the respective portfolios give us sufficient freedom to operate, a third-party could assert that the development, manufacture or commercialization of any of our products or product candidates infringes its patents or other proprietary rights, potentially resulting in harm to our business and financial results. Further, the intellectual property rights that we own or license might be subject to liens or other encumbrances. If we are required to defend against such claims or to protect our own or our licensed proprietary rights against others, it could result in substantial financial and business costs as well as the distraction of our management. An adverse ruling in any litigation or administrative proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, result in monetary damages, injunctive relief or otherwise harm our competitive position, including by limiting our marketing and selling activities, increasing the risk for generic competition, limiting our development and commercialization activities or requiring us to obtain licenses to use the relevant technology (which licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all).\nThere has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. We may become a party to intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings, including interference or derivation, inter partes review, post grant review or reexamination proceedings before the USPTO. In addition, generic entrants could file an ANDA to seek approval of a generic form of one or more of our products. If an ANDA filer is ultimately successful in patent litigation against us, meets the requirements for a generic version of our branded product to the satisfaction of the FDA under its ANDA, and is able to supply the product in significant commercial quantities, the generic company could introduce a generic version to the market. For example, pursuant to the settlement agreement entered into with Sandoz in March 2018, Sandoz could introduce a generic version of ferumoxytol to the market earlier than the expiration of our patents. As noted above, if Sandoz receives FDA approval of its ANDA by a certain date, Sandoz may launch its generic version of Feraheme on July 15, 2021. The approval of Sandoz\u2019s ANDA could cause our stock price to decline and our sales of Feraheme are expected to decline upon the availability of the generic, which would have an adverse impact on our business, including our development pipeline, and results of operations. Further, we may face similar suits in the future, including for our other products, which will be expensive and will consume considerable time and other resources, which could materially and adversely impact our business, especially if we have to divert resources from our commercialization or business development efforts.\nWe also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and improvements, unpatented know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position, which we seek to protect, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our corporate licensees, collaborators, contract manufacturers, employees and consultants. However, these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breaches, and our trade secrets and other confidential information might become known. In addition, we cannot be certain that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent or superseding proprietary technology, or that an equivalent product will not be marketed in competition with our products, thereby substantially reducing the value of our proprietary rights.\nWe depend, to a significant degree, on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payers for the use of our products, and a reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement, especially in light of generic competition, could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize our products is dependent, in significant part, on the availability and level of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including governmental payers, private health insurers and other organizations. Coverage by third-party payers depends on a number of factors, including the third-party\u2019s determination of a products\u2019 clinical and cost effectiveness, both individually and within their therapeutic class.\nThere is a continued scrutiny, intensifying criticism and political focus on pharmaceutical pricing practices at both national and regional levels. U.S. state legislators are implementing a variety of regulations intended to increase the transparency of pharmaceutical pricing, which may lead to future price control regulations at state levels. Federally, multiple price control mechanisms have been suggested in the recent past, and bi-partisan focus on the issues remains a high priority. Consolidation of PBMs and managed care organizations is also increasing the pricing pressure in the commercial, Medicare Part D and Managed Medicaid marketplaces. Fewer independent decision makers in the PBM marketplace may lead to increased downward pressure on the prices of our products through increased rebates or discounts.\nCertain specialty pharmaceutical companies, pharmaceutical companies and pricing strategies have been the subject of increased scrutiny and criticism by politicians and the media, which could also increase pricing pressure throughout the industry, or lead to new legislation that may limit our pricing flexibility or subject us to criticism and reputational harm in response to any price increases. Congress, the current presidential administration and prospective presidential candidates have each indicated that they will continue to pursue new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. The current presidential administration released a \u201cBlueprint,\u201d which contains certain measures that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is already working to implement, which focus in part on the cost of drugs. For example, in October 2018, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (\u201cANPRM\u201d), indicating it is considering issuing a proposed rule on a model called the International Pricing Index. This model would utilize a basket of other countries\u2019 prices as a reference for the Medicare program to use in reimbursing for drugs covered under Part B. The ANPRM also included an updated version of the Competitive Acquisition Program as an alternative to current \u201cbuy and bill\u201d payment methods for Part B drugs. To date, a proposed rule has not yet been released. If third-party payers provide an insufficient level of coverage and reimbursement for our products, physicians and other healthcare providers may choose to prescribe alternative products, including generics, which would have an adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues.\nIn addition, federal budgetary concerns could result in the implementation of significant federal spending cuts or regulatory changes, including cuts in Medicare and other health-related spending in the near-term or changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \u201cACA\u201d). For example, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d, which will shift cost for name brand drugs away from Part D participants and back to the manufacturers, which could have a negative effect on our profits. Further, in June 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than $12.0 billion in ACA risk corridor payments to third-party payors. In December 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in Moda Health Plan, Inc. v. United States, which will determine whether the government must make risk corridor payments. The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision will be released in the coming months, but we cannot predict how the U.S. Supreme Court will rule. These efforts could mean that third-party payors will not have the levels of funding historically available for coverage and reimbursement of our products, and the effects and risks to our business are not yet fully known. Further, the reimbursement and health care regulatory landscape have continued to evolve rapidly over recent months, including as a result of recent court decisions, making the healthcare landscape (and its impact on third-party payors, providers and our business, and on the viability of the ACA itself) unpredictable. In 2020, litigation, regulation, and legislation related to the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. The extent, timing and details of the changes are not currently known, but the federally funded healthcare landscape could face significant changes during the current presidential administration, including in the near-term, and could impact state and local healthcare programs, including Medicaid and Medicare, which could also have a negative impact on our future operating results. The magnitude of the impact of these laws and developments on our business is uncertain. Medicare payment policy, in time, can also influence pricing and reimbursement in the non-Medicare markets, as private third-party payers and state Medicaid plans frequently adopt Medicare principles in setting reimbursement methodologies. These and any future changes in government regulation or private third-party payers\u2019 reimbursement policies may reduce the extent of reimbursement for our products and adversely affect our future operating results.\nThe introduction of generic competition in a therapeutic category where our products are used may also affect the reimbursement policies of government authorities and third-party payers. Many generic first regulations, as well as policies and\npractices promoting use of low cost alternatives, can place significant downward pressure on the use of our branded products. Additionally, clinical and cost effectiveness reviews of previously established coverage decisions post generic entry, may further limit coverage and the amount of reimbursement for branded medications when there is a generic available. Reimbursement levels or the lack of reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, our branded products. In the U.S, continued increase in patient cost sharing, in the form of higher deductibles, copay and coinsurance levels, have led to patients being burdened with substantial out-of-pocket costs. New measures such as copay aggregators where the manufacturer\u2019s payment assistance, such as copay and insurance cards, no longer count toward a patient\u2019s deductible or out-of-pocket maximum, limit the overall benefit a manufacture can offer the patient. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products, and/or our financial results from the sale of related products could be negatively and materially impacted.\nFailure to obtain or maintain regulatory approval in international jurisdictions or to establish a commercialization organization, or partner with a third party to commercialize our products outside of the U.S., could prevent us from marketing certain of our products abroad and could limit the growth of our business.\nWe may attempt to market, including through a license partner, certain of our existing and future products, product candidates or certain indications outside of the U.S. In order to market our products in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) and many other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by foreign regulatory authorities and the approval procedures in foreign jurisdictions can vary widely and can involve additional clinical trials and data review beyond that required by the FDA.\nWe have limited experience in preparing, filing and executing the applications necessary to gain foreign regulatory approvals or commercializing products outside of the U.S. and may need to rely on third-parties, including potential collaborators, to assist us with these processes. There are limited opportunities available that align with our business strategy and there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify or complete any additional transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, or that such transactions will be successfully integrated into our business. In addition, proposing, negotiating and implementing collaborations, in-licensing arrangements or acquisition agreements is a lengthy, complex, time-consuming and expensive process and such transactions are often subject to increasing regulatory oversight. Other companies, including those with substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources, may compete with us for these arrangements, and we may not be able to enter into such arrangements on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIf we pursue regulatory approval outside of the U.S., we may not obtain approval on a timely basis, or at all, and therefore we may be unable to successfully commercialize our products internationally. Further, regulatory oversight and actions may be disrupted or delayed in regions particularly impacted by the coronavirus if regulators and industry professionals are expending significant and unexpected resources addressing the outbreak. Additionally, even if we obtain regulatory approval, we will need to establish a commercial organization, or partner with a third party, to commercialize our products in other territories. If we are unable to successfully establish a commercialization infrastructure or enter into an agreement with a third-party on acceptable terms, or at all, we are unlikely to be able to market our products outside of the U.S.\nLawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and an adverse determination in any current or future lawsuits in which we are a defendant could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe administration of our products to, or the use of our products by, humans may expose us to liability claims, whether or not our products are actually at fault for causing any harm or injury. Makena is a prescription hormone medicine (progestin) used to lower the risk of preterm birth in women who are pregnant and who have previously delivered preterm in the past. It is not known if Makena is safe and effective in women who have other risk factors for preterm birth and in one clinical study, certain complications or events associated with pregnancy occurred more often in women who received Makena, including miscarriage (pregnancy loss before 20 weeks of pregnancy), hospital admission for preterm labor, preeclampsia, gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes. In addition, other hormones administered during pregnancy have in the past been shown to cross the placenta and have negative effects on the offspring.\nWe may also be the target of claims asserting violations of securities and fraud and abuse laws, derivative actions, consumer protection laws or other litigation, including contractual disputes. For example, in connection with the results of the PROLONG trial, we have recently been named as defendants in multiple class action suits alleging that we have made misrepresentations and omissions regarding the effectiveness of Makena in connection with its sale and marketing. In addition, the former equityholders of Lumara Health Inc. (\u201cLumara\u201d) have filed a complaint against us alleging that we did not exercise commercially reasonable efforts to market and sell the Makena drug product and that we failed to achieve sales milestones for Makena, in breach of our 2014 merger agreement.\nAny such litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could cause serious harm to our business, operating results and financial condition. As with any litigation, regardless of the merit or outcome, these claims or suits may decrease demand for our products, generate negative publicity, cause other parties to submit claims or demands, subject us to product recalls, harm our reputation and divert management\u2019s time and attention. Further, we may not be successful in defending ourselves in a litigation and, as a result, our business could be materially harmed. These lawsuits may also result in large judgments or settlements against us, and, though we maintain liability insurance, if any judgment or settlement against us and costs or expenses associated with litigation exceed our insurance coverage or insurance coverage is denied, we may be forced to bear some or all of these costs and expenses directly, which could be substantial and have a negative effect on our financial condition and business.\nWe must work effectively and collaboratively with our licensors to develop, market and/or sell certain products in our portfolio.\nWe rely on our licensors for support with our in-licensed products and product candidates and are dependent upon our ability to work effectively and collaboratively with our licensors to develop, market and/or sell the licensed products in our portfolio, including to obtain or maintain regulatory approval. Our arrangements with licensors is critical to successfully bringing our licensed products to market and successfully commercializing them. We rely on our licensors in various respects, including progressing our development, regulatory and commercialization efforts. We do not control our licensors, some of whom may be inexperienced, have a limited operating history, face financial and business hardships (including solvency issues), have limited operations or financial or other resources or have limited or no experience with commercialization activities; therefore, we cannot ensure that these third parties will adequately and timely perform all of their obligations to us. For example, we are dependent upon the contributions of Endoceutics, a small company, to exclusively provide us with all commercial supply and conduct certain clinical and commercialization activities. We cannot guarantee the satisfactory performance of any of our licensors and if any of our licensors breach or terminate their agreements with us, we may not be able to successfully commercialize the licensed product, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nFurther, even if contractual safeguards are in place in our licensing arrangements, our licensors may use their own or other technology to develop an alternative product and withdraw their support of the licensed product, or compete with the licensed product. Our licensing arrangements could also limit our activities, including our ability to compete with our licensors in certain geographic or therapeutic areas. For example, Endoceutics\u2019 assets, including the intellectual property licensed to us, are subject to a security interest held by a third-party lender, and therefore our rights and remedies under the license agreement may be impaired or inadequate. Disputes may arise between us and a licensor and may involve the ownership of technology developed under a license, the level of commercialization or other efforts or business decisions, or other issues arising out of collaborative agreements.\nIn addition, we must work collaboratively with our partners to conduct various activities and if we cannot do so effectively, disagreements could arise. Such disagreements could delay the related program or result in distraction or expensive arbitration or litigation, which may not be resolved in our favor. For example, in order for our divestiture of Intrarosa and Vyleesi to be executed smoothly, we will need to collaborate with Endoceutics and Palatin in our efforts to consummate any divestiture.\nOur license and purchase agreements contain complex provisions and impose various milestone payment, royalty, insurance, diligence, reporting and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with our obligations, our partners may have the right to terminate the license agreement, in which event we would not be able to continue developing or commercializing the licensed products, or we may incur additional costs or may be required to litigate any disputes. If our partners allege that we have breached our obligations under such arrangements, even if such allegations are without merit, such allegations could be disruptive to or interfere with our operations and business strategy, and defending such allegations, including complying with any audit, reporting or dispute resolution provisions of such agreement, or conducting any investigations, can be expensive and utilize considerable amounts of management\u2019s time and efforts. For example, under the terms of each of our agreements with Endoceutics and Palatin, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts in the sale of Intrarosa and Vyleesi, respectively, and if either party alleges that we are in violation of these obligations, we may incur significant disruptions and/or expense defending our efforts. Termination of a license agreement or reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms, and, if we lose rights to the licensed products it could materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on third parties in the conduct of our business, including our clinical trials and product distribution, and if they fail to fulfill their obligations, our commercialization and development plans may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on and intend to continue to rely on third parties, including licensors, CROs, healthcare providers, third-party logistics providers, packaging, storage and labeling providers, wholesale distributors and certain other important vendors and consultants in the conduct of our business. For example, we contract with, and plan to continue to contract with, certain CROs to provide clinical trial services for the development of our product candidates or expansion of product indications, including site selection, enrollment, monitoring, data management and other services, in connection with the conduct of our clinical trials and the preparation and filing of our regulatory applications.\nAlthough we depend heavily on these parties, we do not control them and, therefore, we cannot ensure that these third parties will adequately and timely perform all of their obligations to us. If our third-party service providers cannot adequately fulfill their obligations to us in a timely and satisfactory manner, if the quality and accuracy of our clinical trial data or our regulatory submissions are compromised due to poor quality or failure to adhere to our protocols or regulatory requirements, or if such third parties otherwise fail to adequately discharge their responsibilities or meet deadlines, our current and future development plans and regulatory submissions, or our commercialization efforts in current indications, may be delayed, terminated, limited or subject us to additional expense or regulatory action, which would adversely impact our ability to generate revenues. For example, we are relying on Perosphere Technologies, Inc. (\u201cPerosphere Technologies\u201d), an independent company, to obtain FDA approval of an IDE for use of an automated coagulometer developed by Perosphere Technologies to measure WBCT in our Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical development programs for ciraparantag.\nFurther, in many cases, we do not currently have back-up providers to perform these tasks. If any of these third parties experience significant difficulties in their respective processes, fail to maintain compliance with applicable legal or regulatory requirements, fail to meet expected deadlines or otherwise do not carry out their contractual duties to us or our licensors, or encounter physical or natural damages at their facilities, our ability to deliver our products to meet commercial demand could be significantly impaired. The loss of any third-party provider, especially if compounded by a delay or inability to secure an alternate distribution source for end-users in a timely manner, could cause the distribution of our products to be delayed or interrupted, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we have limited experience independently commercializing multiple pharmaceutical products and collaborating with partners to commercialize multiple licensed products, including managing and maintaining a supply chain and distribution network for multiple products, and we are placing substantial reliance on licensors and other third parties to perform this expanded network of supply chain and distribution services for us. For example, we rely on may have to rely on other parties with whom we may enter into future agreements, to perform or oversee certain functions, such as supply, research and development, or the regulatory process for the product we license from them, and any failure of such party to perform these functions for any reason, including ceasing doing business, could have a material effect on our ability to commercialize the product.\nA pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, or coronavirus, may materially and adversely affect our business and our financial results.\nThe recent outbreak of COVID-19 originated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has since spread to multiple countries, including the United States and several European countries where we are currently conducting our AMAG-423 Phase 2b/3b study. Such events may result in a period of business disruption, including reduced sales or delays in our clinical studies. For example, the spread of COVID-19 in the United States may result in travel restrictions impacting our sales professionals or hospitals may limit access for non-patients, including our sales professionals, which could negatively impact our access to physicians. The spread of COVID-19, or another infectious disease, could also result in delays or disruptions in the supply of our products and product candidates. The continued spread of COVID-19 globally could adversely impact our clinical trial operations in the United States and in Europe, including our ability to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19 if an outbreak occurs in their geography. COVID-19 may also affect employees of third-party contract research organizations located in affected geographies that we rely upon to carry out our clinical trials. We cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions, but if we or any of the third parties with whom we engage were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business in the manner and on the timelines presently planned could be materially and negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operation and financial condition.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees, including the hiring of a new chief executive officer, and any failure to do so may be disruptive to our operations.\nWe are a pharmaceutical company focused on marketing our commercial products and developing our product candidates and the range of skills of our executive officers and management therefore needs to be broad and deep. If we are not able to hire and retain talent to drive commercialization, development and the expansion of our portfolio, we will be unlikely to maintain or increase our profitability. Because of the specialized and broad nature of our business, including both commercialized and development-stage products, our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified sales, technical operations, managerial, scientific, regulatory compliance and medical personnel of all levels. The loss of key personnel or our inability to hire and retain personnel who have such sales, technical operations, managerial, scientific, regulatory compliance and medical backgrounds could materially adversely affect our business (including research and development efforts). In January 2020, we announced that William Heiden will step down as our President and Chief Executive Officer after approximately eight years leading the company. While our Board conducts a search to identify a successor, Mr. Heiden will remain in his current position until his successor is appointed or June 30, 2020 if no successor is appointed by then. In addition, in January 2020 we also announced that we are currently pursuing options to divest Intrarosa and Vyleesi. The uncertainty regarding our intended divestiture of Intrarosa and Vyleesi could harm our ability to attract and retain qualified key personnel, including qualified candidates for the role of Chief Executive Officer, in a timely manner or at all. Further, it may be difficult to attract key employees until we have identified a new Chief Executive Officer. These changes may be disruptive to our operations, including by distracting management from our core business and affecting employee productivity and morale. Further, if there are delays with the selection of a new Chief Executive Officer, or if we do not successfully manage the transition, our business may be negatively impacted.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nThere have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of federal and state legislative initiatives implemented to reform the U.S. healthcare system in ways that could adversely impact our business and our ability to sell our products profitably.\nWe expect that the ACA, as currently enacted or as it may be amended in the future, the 21st Century Cures Act, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase our sales. These changes might impact existing government healthcare programs and may result in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. Changes that may affect our business include, but are not limited to, those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, rules regarding prescription drug benefits under the health insurance exchanges, expansion of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, Medicare, the 340B Drug Pricing Program under the Public Health Services Act (the \u201c340B Program\u201d), and fraud and abuse enforcement. For example, beginning April 1, 2013, Medicare payments for all items under Parts A and B, including drugs and biologics, and most payments to plans under Medicare Part D were reduced by 2% under the sequestration (i.e., automatic spending reductions) required by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the \u201cBCA\u201d) as amended by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The BCA requires sequestration for most federal programs, excluding Medicaid, Social Security, and certain other programs. The BCA caps the cuts to Medicare payments for items at 2% and subsequent legislation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2029.\nWe cannot predict the impact that newly enacted laws or any future legislation or regulation will have on us. We expect that there will continue to be a number of U.S. federal and state proposals to implement governmental pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs. These efforts could adversely affect our business by, among other things, limiting the prices that can be charged for our products, or the amount of reimbursement rates and terms available from governmental agencies or third-party payers, limiting the profitability of our products, increasing our rebate liability or limiting the commercial opportunities for our products, including acceptance by healthcare payers or increasing scrutiny and publication of prices and announced price increases.\nOur partners, including our licensors, are subject to similar requirements and thus the attendant risks and uncertainties. If our partners, including our licensors, suffer material and adverse effects from such risks and uncertainties, our rights and benefits for our licensed products could be negatively impacted, which could have a material and adverse impact on our revenues.\nIf our products are marketed or distributed in a manner that violates federal or state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, marketing disclosure laws or other federal or state laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties.\nIn addition to FDA and related regulatory requirements, our general operations, and the research, development, manufacture, sale and marketing of our products, are subject to extensive additional federal and state healthcare regulation, including the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the Federal False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d) (and their state analogues), as discussed above in Item 1 under the heading \u201cGovernment Regulation - Fraud and Abuse Regulation.\u201d If we or our partners, such as licensors, fail to comply with any federal and state laws or regulations governing our industry, we could be subject to administrative, criminal and civil penalties and a range of regulatory actions that could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our products, harm or prevent sales of our products, or substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing and marketing our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In recent years, CMS has been actively proposing and implementing changes to the list of business practices that are protected by \u201csafe harbors.\u201d There is inherent risk and uncertainty in any changing regulatory environment as companies work to transition business practices to conform with new regulations.\nOur activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws, and private individuals have been active in bringing so-called \u201cwhistleblower\u201d lawsuits on behalf of the government (as \u201cRelators\u201d) under the FCA and similar regulations in other countries. In addition, incentives exist under applicable U.S. law that encourage employees and physicians to report violations of rules governing promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. These incentives could lead to FCA lawsuits, which attempt to recoup moneys paid by government agencies and extract penalties from manufacturers. For example, federal enforcement agencies have recently pursued enforcement actions against pharmaceutical companies\u2019 product and patient assistance programs, including relationships with specialty pharmacies, and support for charitable foundations providing patients with co-pay assistance. In addition, Relators have filed lawsuits involving manufacturer reimbursement support services as well as promotion of pharmaceutical products beyond labeled claims. Some FCA lawsuits have resulted in government enforcement authorities obtaining significant civil and criminal settlements. Such lawsuits, whether with or without merit, are typically time-consuming and costly to defend. Such suits may also result in related shareholder lawsuits, which are also costly to defend.\nFurther, the FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. A product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. FDA also regulates the content of promotional material, including, among other things, the presentation of efficacy information, the types of comparative claims that can be made to distinguish products from those with similar indications, and the balance of risk information provided. For drug products like Makena that are approved by the FDA under the FDA\u2019s accelerated approval regulations, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the sponsor must submit promotional materials at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination of the promotional materials, which delays and may negatively impact our commercial team\u2019s ability to implement changes to Makena\u2019s marketing materials, thereby negatively impacting revenues. For other products, FDA does not review promotional materials prior to dissemination but does issue \u201cUntitled Letters\u201d or \u201cWarning Letters\u201d if it objects to content that has been used promotionally. The FDA may also withdraw approval of drug products under certain conditions. In particular, under the provisions of the FDA\u2019s \u201cSubpart H\u201d Accelerated Approval regulations, the FDA may withdraw approval of Makena if, among other things, the promotional materials are false or misleading, or other evidence demonstrates that Makena is not shown to be safe or effective under its conditions of use.\nIn recent years, in addition to federal legislation related to transparency reporting of transfers of value to healthcare providers and healthcare organizations, several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to file periodic reports. Several states have adopted legislation to require pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing and promotional compliance programs or codes of conduct and/or to file periodic reports with the state or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials, and other activities. Several states have also adopted laws that prohibit certain marketing-related activities, including the provision of gifts, meals or other items to certain healthcare providers.\nWe have developed and implemented a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are current best practices in the pharmaceutical industry; however, relevant compliance laws are broad in scope and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that definitively interpret these laws in the context of particular industry practices. We cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our partners, our consultants or our contractors are or will be in compliance with all federal and state regulations. If we, our partners, or our representatives fail to comply with any of these laws or regulations, a range of fines, penalties and/or other sanctions and regulatory actions could be imposed on us, including, but not limited to, restrictions on how we market and sell our products, significant fines, exclusions from government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, litigation, or other sanctions. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which\ncould also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such investigations or suits may also result in related shareholder lawsuits, which can also have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur partners, including our licensors, are subject to similar requirements and obligations as well as the attendant risks and uncertainties. If our partners, including our licensors, suffer material and adverse effects from such risks and uncertainties, our rights and benefits for our licensed products could be negatively impacted, which could have a material and adverse impact on our revenues.\nIf we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under governmental pricing programs, we could be required to reimburse government programs for underpayments and could pay penalties, sanctions and fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a condition of reimbursement by various federal and state health insurance programs, we are required to calculate and report certain pricing information to federal and state agencies. Please see our discussion above in Item 1 under the heading, \u201cPharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement\u201d for more information regarding price reporting obligations under the 340B Program and the Department of Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule (the \u201cFSS\u201d) program.\nThe regulations governing the calculations, price reporting and payment obligations are complex and subject to interpretation by various government and regulatory agencies, as well as the courts. Reasonable assumptions have been made where there is lack of regulations or clear guidance and such assumptions involve subjective decisions and estimates. We are required to report any revisions to our calculations, price reporting and payment obligations previously reported or paid. Such revisions could affect our liability to federal and state payers and also adversely impact our reported financial results of operations in the period of such restatement.\nUncertainty exists as new laws, regulations, judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, or regulations related to our calculations, price reporting or payments obligations increases the chances of a legal challenge, restatement or investigation. If we become subject to investigations, restatements, or other inquiries concerning our compliance with price reporting laws and regulations, we could be required to pay or be subject to additional reimbursements, penalties, sanctions or fines, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, it is possible that future healthcare reform measures could be adopted which could result in increased pressure on pricing and reimbursement of our products and thus have an adverse impact on our financial position or business operations.\nFurther, state Medicaid programs may be slow to invoice pharmaceutical companies for calculated rebates resulting in a significant lag between the time a sale is recorded and the time the rebate is paid. For example, based on lagged Medicaid claims submitted during 2019, we recognized a significant prior period change in estimate for the Makena IM product. As a result, we are required to carry a substantial liability on our consolidated balance sheets for the estimate of rebate claims expected for Medicaid patients. More than half of Makena auto-injector sales are reimbursed through state Medicaid programs and are subject to the statutory Medicaid rebate, and in many cases, supplemental rebates offered by us. If actual claims are higher than current estimates, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to retroactive rebates and the potential for 340B Program refunds, if we are found to have knowingly submitted any false price information related to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to CMS, we may be liable for civil monetary penalties. Such failure could also be grounds for CMS to terminate our Medicaid drug rebate agreement, pursuant to which we participate in the Medicaid program. In the event that CMS terminates our rebate agreement, federal payments may not be available under government programs, including Medicaid or Medicare Part B, for our covered outpatient drugs.\nAdditionally, if we overcharge the government in connection with the FSS program or Tricare Retail Pharmacy Program, whether due to a misstated Federal Ceiling Price or otherwise, we are required to refund any overpayment to the government. Failure to make necessary disclosures and/or to identify contract overcharges can result in allegations against us under the FCA and other laws and regulations. Unexpected refunds to the government, and responding to a government investigation or enforcement action, would be expensive and time-consuming, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe are subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight of our products, and any failure by us to maintain compliance with applicable regulations may result in several adverse consequences including the suspension of the manufacturing, marketing and sale of our respective products, the incurrence of significant additional expense and other limitations on our ability to commercialize our respective products.\nWe are subject to ongoing regulatory requirements and review, including periodic audits pertaining to the development, manufacture, labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, distribution, storage, marketing, promotion, record keeping and export of our respective products. Failure to comply with such regulatory requirements or the later discovery of previously unknown problems with the manufacture, distributions and storage of our products, or our third-party contract manufacturing facilities or processes by which we manufacture our products may result in restrictions on our ability to develop, manufacture, market, distribute or sell our products, including potential withdrawal of our products from the market. Any such restrictions could slow or stop production development or result in decreased sales, damage to our reputation or the initiation of lawsuits against us and/or our third-party contract manufacturers. We may also be subject to additional sanctions, including, but not limited, to the following:\n\u2022\nWarning letters, public warnings and untitled letters;\n\u2022\nCourt-ordered seizures or injunctions;\n\u2022\nCivil or criminal penalties, or criminal prosecutions;\n\u2022\nVariation, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals for our products;\n\u2022\nChanges to the package insert of our products, such as additional warnings regarding potential side effects or potential limitations on the current dosage or administration;\n\u2022\nRequirements to communicate with physicians and other customers about concerns related to actual or potential safety, efficacy, or other issues involving our products;\n\u2022\nImplementation of risk mitigation programs and post-approval obligations;\n\u2022\nRestrictions on our continued manufacturing, marketing, distribution or sale of our products;\n\u2022\nTemporary or permanent closing of the facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers;\n\u2022\nInterruption or suspension of clinical trials; and\n\u2022\nRefusal by regulators to consider or approve applications for additional indications.\nAny of the above sanctions could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and profitability or the value of our brand, and cause us to incur significant additional expenses.\nIn addition, if our products face any safety or efficacy issues, including drug interaction problems, under the The Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act (the \u201cFDCA\u201d), the FDA has broad authority to force us to take any number of actions, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nRequiring us to conduct post-approval clinical studies to assess product efficacy or known risks or new signals of serious risks, or to evaluate unexpected serious risks;\n\u2022\nMandating changes to a product\u2019s label;\n\u2022\nRequiring us to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy where necessary to assure safe use of the drug; or\n\u2022\nRemoving an already approved product from the market.\nFurther, our partners, including our licensors, are subject to similar requirements and obligations as well as the attendant risks and uncertainties. If our partners, including our licensors, suffer material and adverse effects from such risks and uncertainties, our rights and benefits for our licensed products could be negatively impacted, which could have a material and adverse impact on our revenues.\nRegulators could determine that our clinical trials and/or our manufacturing processes, and/or our storage or those of our third parties, were not properly designed or are not properly operated, which could cause significant costs or setbacks for approval of our product candidates or our commercialization activities.\nWe are obligated to conduct, and are in the process of conducting, clinical trials for certain of our product candidates and certain post-approval clinical trials for certain of our products and we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials, including if we pursue approval of additional indications, new formulations or methods of administration for our products, seek commercialization in other jurisdictions, or in support of our current indications. The FDA could determine that our clinical trials, or those of our licensors, and/or our or their manufacturing processes were not properly designed, did not include enough patients or appropriate administration, were not conducted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, or were otherwise not properly managed. In addition, according to cGCP we and/or our licensors are responsible for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. The FDA may conduct inspections of clinical investigator sites which are involved in clinical development programs for our proprietary or licensed products to ensure their compliance with cGCP regulations. If the FDA determines that we, our licensors, our respective CROs or our respective study sites fail to comply with applicable cGCP regulations, the FDA may deem the clinical data generated in such clinical trials to be unreliable and may disqualify certain data generated from those sites or require us and/or our licensors to perform additional clinical trials. For example, many of the clinical trials for our development programs that we have acquired or in-licensed were conducted by small companies that might have had fewer controls or oversight related to their clinical programs. Clinical trials and manufacturing processes are subject to similar risks and uncertainties outside of the U.S. Any such deficiency in the design, implementation or oversight of clinical development programs or post-approval clinical studies could cause us to incur significant additional costs, experience delays or prevent us from commercializing our approved products in their current indications, or obtaining marketing approval for additional indications for our products or product candidates, including AMAG-423 and ciraparantag.\nFurther, our third-party contract manufacturing facilities and those of our licensors are subject to cGMP regulations enforced by the FDA and equivalent foreign regulations and regulatory agencies through periodic inspections to confirm such compliance. Contract manufacturers must continually expend time, money and effort in production, record-keeping and quality assurance and control to ensure that these manufacturing facilities meet applicable regulatory requirements. Failure to maintain ongoing compliance with cGMP or similar foreign regulations and other applicable manufacturing requirements of various U.S. or foreign regulatory agencies could result in, among other things, the issuance of warning letters, fines, the withdrawal or recall of our products from the marketplace, failure to approve product candidates for commercialization, total or partial suspension of product production, the loss of inventory, suspension of the review of our or our licensors\u2019 current or future NDAs, BLAs or equivalent foreign filings, enforcement actions, injunctions or criminal prosecution and suspension of manufacturing authorizations. For example, as discussed above, Pfizer, our former primary drug product manufacturer of the Makena branded products, experienced manufacturing issues, which resulted in our inability to meet the demand for both our branded Makena products and the Makena authorized generic, both of which we ultimately had to discontinue during 2019. A government-mandated recall or a voluntary recall could divert managerial and financial resources, could be difficult and costly to correct, could result in the suspension of sales of our products and reputational harm, and could have a severe adverse impact on our profitability and the future prospects of our business. If any regulatory agency inspects any of these manufacturing facilities and determines that they are not in compliance with cGMP or similar regulations or our contract manufacturers otherwise determine that they are not in compliance with these regulations, as applicable, such contract manufacturers could experience an inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of product to meet demand or incur unanticipated compliance expenditures.\nWe and our licensors have also established certain testing and release specifications with the FDA. This release testing must be performed in order to allow products to be used for commercial sale. If a product does not meet these release specifications or if the release testing is variable, we may not be able to supply product to meet our projected demand. We monitor annual batches of our products for ongoing stability after it has been released for commercial sale. If a particular batch of product exhibits variations in its stability or begins to generate test results that demonstrate an adverse trend against our specifications, we may need to conduct an investigation into the test results, quarantine the product to prevent further use, destroy existing inventory no longer acceptable for commercial sale, or recall the batch or batches. If we or our licensors are unable to develop, validate, transfer or gain regulatory approval for the new release test, our ability to supply product will be adversely affected. Such setbacks could have an adverse impact on our revenues, our profitability and the future prospects of our business.\nOur failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation, and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nWe are subject to complex laws and regulations that address data privacy and information security. The legislative and regulatory landscape for data protection continues to evolve, and in recent years there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data security issues. In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. For example, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which came into effect on January 1, 2020 and provides new data privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for companies, which may increase our compliance costs and potential liability. The CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. While there is currently an exception for protected health information that is subject to HIPAA and clinical trial regulations, as currently written, the CCPA may impact certain of our business activities. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that is expected to increase data breach litigation. The CCPA could mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent state and/or federal privacy legislation in the U.S., which could increase our potential liability and adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, in the course of our business, we may obtain health information from third parties (e.g., healthcare providers who prescribe our products) that is subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH\u201d). Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA (other than potentially with respect to providing certain employee benefits) we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA/HITECH.\nWe could also be negatively impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, data privacy, data localization and data protection outside of the U.S., such as the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which took effect in the EU in May 2018. The GDPR extended the geographical scope of EU data protection law to non-EU entities under certain conditions, tightened existing EU data protection principles and created new obligations for companies and new rights for individuals. Although we believe we are in compliance the applicable provisions of the GDPR, GDPR guidance, interpretation and enforcement are still developing and may change. The GDPR may increase our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data that we process, expose us to substantial potential fines and increase our compliance costs. The GDPR could also cause our development costs to increase in connection with clinical trials we are currently conducting and may conduct in the future in the EU for our products and product candidates.\nFailure by us or our third party vendors to comply with data protection laws and regulations both within and outside of the U.S. could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation, and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nSignificant disruptions of information technology systems or data breaches could adversely affect our business.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure, and data to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store, and transmit large amounts of confidential information (including, but not limited to, intellectual property, proprietary business information, and personal information). It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information. We also have outsourced elements of our operations to third parties, and as a result we manage a number of third-party vendors who may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology systems, and those of third-party vendors with whom we contract, and the large amounts of confidential information stored on those systems, make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to data breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party vendors, and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication, and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering (including phishing), ransomware, and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. We have from time to time experienced, and may continue to experience in the future, cyber attacks on our information technology systems despite our best efforts to prevent them.\nSignificant disruptions of our information technology systems or data breaches could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss, misappropriation, and/or unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, confidential information (including, but not limited to, trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information, and personal information), and could result in financial, legal, business, and reputational harm to us. Any\nsuch event that leads to unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our patients or employees, could harm our reputation, require us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information. Data breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. While we have implemented security measures and controls to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent service interruptions or data breaches that could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to our Financial Condition and Results\nWe may need additional capital to complete development of our product candidates or achieve our business objectives and make contingent payments that may become due under our strategic transaction arrangements, which could cause significant dilution to our stockholders.\nWe may require additional funds or need to establish additional alternative strategic arrangements to execute a business development transaction. For example, we intend to pursue opportunities for certain of our products and product candidates in markets outside of the U.S. We have expended and continue to expend substantial costs associated with the clinical development of our product candidates, including AMAG-423 and ciraparantag, the continued commercialization of our products, our debt obligations and certain milestone payments to our partners. We may at any time seek funding through additional arrangements with collaborators or through public or private equity or debt financings, which could result in dilution to our stockholders or increased fixed payment obligations. In addition, we may need to seek additional capital to fund our operations or for strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans. The conditions of the credit and capital markets can be volatile, unpredictable and inconsistent and we may not be able to obtain financing or to secure alternative strategic arrangements on acceptable terms or within an acceptable timeframe, if at all, which would limit our ability to execute on our strategic plans. Moreover, we may experience a reduction in value or loss of liquidity with respect to our investments, which would put further strain on our cash resources.\nOur current level of cash on hand may require us to implement additional cost-cutting initiatives or limit our ability to execute on our strategic plans, including the development of our pipeline, and we may not be able to take advantage of attractive business development opportunities. In addition, our cash on hand may not be sufficient to make any cash milestone payments to our partners upon the achievement of sales or regulatory milestones, including in the event we are unable to consummate a sale of Intrarosa or Vyleesi, in a timely manner, on favorable terms, or at all. Our ability to make these required payments could be adversely affected if we do not achieve expected revenue and cash flow forecasts, or if we are unable to find other sources of cash in the future. We may also suffer reputational harm and be viewed as an undesirable acquiror or business development partner if we are unable to make the required payments under our strategic transaction arrangements. In addition, if equity or debt investors perceive that our debt levels are too high relative to our profit, our stock price could be negatively affected and/or our ability to raise new equity or debt capital could be limited.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, enter into term loans and credit facilities with various banking institutions. Our ability and the terms on which we can borrow will be subject to the state of our operations and the debt market, which is unpredictable and beyond the scope of our control. We may not be able to borrow required amounts on favorable terms, including favorable interest rates, or at all. Further, borrowings under such facilities may bear interest at variable rates exposing us to interest rate risk.\nOur long-term capital requirements will depend on many other factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nWhether we are successful in selling Intrarosa and Vyleesi and the amount of consideration paid to us in connection with any related sale transaction, if any;\n\u2022\nThe commercial success of our products, particularly Feraheme, on whose sales we are increasingly reliant, and costs associated with the commercialization of our products, including marketing, sales and distribution costs, including any impact to Makena sales as a result of the October 2019 Advisory Committee meeting or in anticipation of or following a decision by the FDA as to whether Makena remains on the market;\n\u2022\nThe ultimate determination by the FDA with regard to Makena following the October 2019 Advisory Committee meeting;\n\u2022\nThe competitive landscape for Feraheme, including the timing of the entry of a generic version of Feraheme entering the market;\n\u2022\nOur ability to service our debt, or to raise additional capital on terms and within a timeframe acceptable to us, if necessary;\n\u2022\nThe outcome, timing and costs associated with development and regulatory approval of our product candidates, including conducting clinical trials;\n\u2022\nOur obligations to make milestone payments, royalty payments or both under our strategic arrangements;\n\u2022\nOur ability to successfully streamline our operations when we divest our women\u2019s health business, and realize the other anticipated benefits in connection with such divestiture;\n\u2022\nThe outcome of and costs associated with any litigation or patent challenges to which we are or may become a party;\n\u2022\nThe costs of manufacturing our products and product candidates, including the timing and magnitude of costs associated with qualifying additional manufacturing capacities and alternative suppliers and any minimum penalties under our CMO agreements.\nAdditional funds may not be available to us if and when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds, if needed, we may have to delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our products or product candidates and/or other areas of our business.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax assets is dependent on generating future taxable income and may be limited, including as a result of future transactions involving our common stock.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses and certain other tax assets to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the testing period, which is generally three years. An ownership change could limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss, interest expense, and tax credit carryforwards for taxable years including or following such \u201cownership change\u201d by allowing us to utilize only a portion of these carryforwards that would otherwise be available but for such ownership change. In addition, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201c2017 Tax Act\u201d), the amount of post 2017 net operating losses that we are permitted to deduct in any taxable year is limited to 80% of our taxable income in such year, where taxable income is determined without regard to the net operating loss deduction itself. The 2017 Tax Act also generally eliminates the ability to carry back any net operating loss to prior taxable years, while allowing post 2017 interest expense carryforwards and unused net operating losses to be carried forward indefinitely without expiration. Limitations imposed on the ability to use net operating losses and tax credits to offset future taxable income or the failure to generate sufficient taxable income could require us to pay more U.S. federal income taxes than we have estimated and could cause such net operating losses and tax credits to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the benefit of such net operating losses and tax credits and potentially adversely affecting our financial position, including our after-tax net income. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not undergo an ownership change and even minor accumulations by certain of our stockholders could result in triggering an ownership change under Section 382. If such an ownership change were to occur, we expect that our net operating losses and interest expense and tax credit carryforwards could become limited; however, the amount of the limitation would depend on a number of factors including our market value at the time of the ownership change. As of December 31, 2019, we have established a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets other than refundable alternative minimum tax credits.\nIn addition, we are potentially subject to ongoing and periodic tax examinations and audits in various jurisdictions, including with respect to the amount of our net operating losses and any limitation thereon. An adjustment to such net operating loss carryforwards, including an adjustment from a taxing authority, could result in higher tax costs, penalties and interest, thereby adversely impacting our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf we identify a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, our ability to meet our reporting obligations and the trading price of our stock could be negatively affected.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented\nor detected on a timely basis. Accordingly, a material weakness increases the risk that the financial information we report contains material errors.\nWe regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies. In addition, we are required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to report annually on our internal control over financial reporting. Any system of internal controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. If we, or our independent registered public accounting firm, determine that our internal controls over our financial reporting are not effective, or we discover areas that need improvement in the future, or we experience high turnover of our personnel in our financial reporting functions, these shortcomings could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results, and the price of our common stock could be negatively affected.\nIf we cannot conclude that we have effective internal control over our financial reporting, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified opinion regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which could lead to a decline in our stock price. Failure to comply with reporting requirements could subject us to sanctions and/or investigations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, NASDAQ or other regulatory authorities.\nIf the estimates we make, or the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our consolidated financial statements and/or our projected guidance prove inaccurate, our actual results may vary from those reflected in our projections and accruals.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, our management evaluates our critical and other significant estimates and assumptions, including among others those associated with revenue recognition related to product sales; product sales allowances and accruals; allowance for doubtful accounts, marketable securities; inventory; acquisition date fair value and subsequent fair value estimates used to assess impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, including intangible assets, debt obligations; certain accrued liabilities, including clinical trial accruals; income taxes, inclusive of valuation allowances, and equity-based compensation expense. We base our estimates on market data, our observance of trends in our industry, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. If actual results differ from these estimates, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial results and the performance of our stock.\nFurther, in January 2020, we issued financial guidance, including expected 2020 total revenue and profitability metrics, which is likewise based on estimates and the judgment of management. If, for any reason, we are unable to achieve our projected 2020 revenue or profitability, we may not realize our publicly announced financial guidance. If we fail to realize, or if we change or update any element of, our publicly disclosed financial guidance or other expectations about our business, our stock price could decline in value.\nAs part of our revenue recognition policy, our estimates of product returns, rebates and chargebacks, accounts receivable, fees and other discounts require subjective and complex judgments due to the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Any significant differences between our actual results and our estimates could materially adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, to determine the required quantities of our products and their related manufacturing schedules, we also need to make significant judgments and estimates based on inventory levels, current market trends, anticipated sales, forecasts and other factors. Because of the inherent nature of estimates, there could be significant differences between our estimates and the actual amount of product need. For example, the level of our access to wholesaler and distributor inventory levels and sales data, which varies based on the wholesaler, distributor, clinic or hospital, affects our ability to accurately estimate certain reserves included in our financial statements. Any difference between our estimates and the actual amount of product demand could result in unmet demand or excess inventory, each of which would adversely impact our financial results and results of operations.\nWe have significant goodwill and impaired a significant portion of intangible assets during 2019. Consequently, any potential future impairment of goodwill and intangible assets may significantly impact our profitability.\nGoodwill and finite-lived intangible assets represent a significant portion of our assets. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, goodwill and intangible assets comprised approximately 56% and 54%, respectively, of our total assets. Goodwill is subject to an impairment analysis, which involves judgment and assumptions, at least annually or whenever events or changes in\ncircumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. In addition, finite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. For example, we identified multiple indicators of impairment during 2019, which resulted in total intangible asset impairment charges of $228.7 million. These impairment charges related to our Makena, Intrarosa and Vyleesi products as a result of (i) the termination of a distribution and supply agreement with our former authorized generic partner, (ii) the unfavorable FDA Advisory Committee recommendation for Makena and the resulting potential that the FDA could withdraw approval of Makena and (iii) our intention to divest Intrarosa and Vyleesi based on the strategic review that we conducted. The estimates, judgments and assumptions used in our impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets, and the results of our testing, are discussed in Note I, \u201cGoodwill and Intangible Assets, Net\u201d to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.\u201d Our assessments were based on our estimates and assumptions, a number of which are based on external factors and the exercise of management judgment. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. Events giving rise to impairment of goodwill or intangible assets are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and often cannot be predicted. Events that could indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment of goodwill include, but are not limited to, an adverse change in current economic and market conditions, including a significant prolonged decline in market capitalization, a significant adverse change in legal factors, unexpected adverse business conditions, and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. As a result of the significance of goodwill, our results of operations and financial position in a future period could be negatively impacted should an impairment test be triggered that results in an impairment of goodwill.\nOur operating results will likely fluctuate, including as a result of wholesaler, distributor and customer buying patterns, as such you should not rely on the results of any single quarter to predict how we will perform over time.\nOur future operating results will likely vary from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the factors described in these Risk Factors, many of which we cannot control, as well as the timing and magnitude, as applicable, of:\n\u2022\nAny announcements or speculation regarding the status or result of our previously announced results of our strategic review, including our intention to pursue options to divest Intrarosa and Vyleesi and the timing and nature of any strategic arrangements related to the divestiture of Intrarosa and Vyleesi;\n\u2022\nProduct revenues, including the level of decline in Makena sales, potential inventory write-downs or adverse impacts to reserves as a result of the outcome of the October 2019 Advisory Committee, any future FDA action or decisions related to Makena or generic competition;\n\u2022\nRegulatory approval of our product candidates, including AMAG-423 and ciraparantag;\n\u2022\nCosts associated with manufacturing batch failures or inventory write-offs due to out-of-specification release testing or ongoing stability testing that results in a batch no longer meeting specifications;\n\u2022\nThe loss of a key customer or group purchasing organizations (\u201cGPOs\u201d);\n\u2022\nThe timing of costs and liabilities incurred in connection with our clinical trials and other product development and commercialization efforts, business development activities or business development transactions into which we may enter;\n\u2022\nMilestone payments we may be required to pay pursuant to contractual obligations;\n\u2022\nCosts associated with the manufacture of our products, including costs of raw and other materials and costs associated with maintaining commercial and clinical inventory and qualifying additional manufacturing capacities and alternative suppliers and any minimum penalties under our CMO agreements;\n\u2022\nAny changes to the mix of our business;\n\u2022\nChanges in accounting estimates related to reserves on revenue, returns, contingent consideration, impairment of long-lived or intangible assets or goodwill or other accruals or changes in the timing and availability of government or customer discounts, rebates and incentives;\n\u2022\nVolatility in the markets, including as a result of political instability, civil unrest, war or terrorism, or pandemics or other natural disasters, such as the recent outbreak of coronavirus;\n\u2022\nThe implementation of new or revised accounting or tax rules or policies; and\n\u2022\nThe recognition of deferred tax assets during periods in which we generate taxable income and our ability to preserve our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets.\nOur results of operations, including, in particular, product revenues, may also vary from period to period due to the buying patterns of our wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies, clinics or hospitals, specialty pharmacies and physicians (\u201cCustomers\u201d). Further, our contracts with GPOs often require certain performance from the members of the GPOs on an individual account level or group level such as growth over prior periods or certain market share attainment goals in order to qualify for discounts off the list price of our products, and a GPO may be able to influence the demand for our products from its members in a particular quarter through communications they make to their members. In the event the Customers with whom we do business determine to limit their purchases of our products, our product revenues could be adversely affected. Also, in the event the Customers purchase increased quantities of our products to take advantage of volume discounts or similar benefits, our quarterly results will fluctuate as re-orders become less frequent, and our overall net pricing may decrease as a result of such discounts and similar benefits. In addition, these contracts are often cancellable at any time by our customers, often without notice, and are non-exclusive agreements within the Feraheme iron deficiency anemia market. While these contracts are intended to support the use of our products, our competitors could offer better pricing, incentives, higher rebates or exclusive relationships.\nOur contracting strategies can also have an impact on the timing of certain purchases causing product revenues to vary from quarter to quarter. For example, in advance of an anticipated or rumored price increase, including following the publication of our quarterly ASP, which affects the rate at which Feraheme is reimbursed, or a reduction in expected rebates or discounts for one of our products, customers may order our products in larger than normal quantities, which could cause sales to be lower in subsequent quarters than they would have been otherwise. Further, any changes in purchasing patterns or inventory levels, changes to our contracting strategies, increases in product returns, delays in purchasing products or delays in payment for products by one of our distributors or GPOs could also have a negative impact on our revenue and results of operations.\nAs a result of these and other factors, our quarterly operating results could fluctuate, and this fluctuation could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Results from one quarter should not be used as an indication of future performance.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile, and your investment in our stock could decline in value or fluctuate significantly, including as a result of analysts\u2019 activities.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, and your investment in our stock could decline in value or fluctuate significantly. Our stock price has ranged between $6.81 and $15.09 in the fifty-two week period through March 2, 2020. The stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, particularly in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals sectors, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Various factors and events, including the factors and events described in these Risk Factors, many of which are beyond our control, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock. Our stock price could also be subject to, among other things, fluctuations as a result of general market conditions, proxy contests and attempts to disrupt our strategy by activist investors, sales of large blocks of our common stock, the impact of our stock repurchase program or the dilutive effect of our 2022 Convertible Notes, other equity or equity-linked financings, alternative strategic arrangements that we may pursue, such as our recently announced intention to pursue options to divest Intrarosa and Vyleesi, or regulatory decisions, such as a determination by the FDA, whether adverse or not, related to Makena. For example, during 2019, an activist stockholder sought to make changes to our Board, among other matters, which ultimately resulted in us entering into a settlement agreement with the stockholder, and for which we incurred considerable costs and a significant amount of management\u2019s and the Board\u2019s time was diverted from our business.\nOur future operating results are subject to substantial uncertainty, and our stock price could decline significantly if we fail to meet or exceed analysts\u2019 forecasts and expectations. If any of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, lower their price target or issue commentary or observations about us or our stock that are perceived by the market as negative, our stock price would likely decline rapidly. In addition, if these analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could also cause our stock price to decline.\nCertain provisions in our charter and by-laws, certain provisions of our 2022 Convertible Notes, certain contractual relationships and certain Delaware law provisions could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove the current members of our Board.\nCertain provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our by-laws may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control or takeover attempt of our company by a third-party as well as substantially impede the ability of our stockholders to benefit from a change of control or effect a change in management and our Board. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nThe ability of our Board to increase or decrease the size of the Board without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nAdvance notice requirements for the nomination of candidates for election to our Board and for proposals to be brought before our annual meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022\nThe authority of our Board to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nNon-cumulative voting for directors; and\n\u2022\nLimitations on the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (\u201cSection 203\u201d), which prevents us from engaging in any business combination with any \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d which is defined generally as a person that acquires 15% or more of a corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in the manner prescribed in Section 203. These provisions could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by, or beneficial to, our stockholders.\nIn addition to the above factors, an acquisition of our company could be viewed by a potential acquiror as costly in light of the employment agreements we have in place with our executive officers, as well as a company-wide change of control policy, which provide for severance benefits as well as the full acceleration of vesting of any outstanding options or restricted stock units in the event of a change of control and subsequent termination of employment. Further, our 2019 Equity Incentive Plan generally permits our Board to provide for the acceleration of vesting of options granted under that plan in the event of certain transactions that result in a change of control.\nFurthermore, holders of the 2022 Convertible Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof and the conversion rate for the 2022 Convertible Notes may be increased as described in the indenture, in each case, upon the occurrence of certain change of control transactions, which could have the effect of preventing a change of control, whether or not it is desired by, or beneficial to, our stockholders, or may result in the acquisition of us being on terms less favorable to our stockholders than it would otherwise be.", "PERMNO": 10363, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "AMAG"}
