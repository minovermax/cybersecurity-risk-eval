{"cik": "1389072", "company": "HeartWare International, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business faces many risks. We believe the risks described below are material risks facing the Company. However, these risks may not be the only risks we face. Additional unknown risks, or risks that we currently consider immaterial, may also impair our business operations. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our shares could decline significantly. Investors should consider the specific risk factors discussed below, together with the cautionary statements under the caption \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d and the other information and documents that we file from time to time with the SEC.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Standing\nWe have incurred operating losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our ability to achieve profitability from a current net loss level will depend on our ability to increase gross revenue, manage our expenditures and reduce the per-unit cost of producing the HVAD System by increasing our customer orders and manufacturing volume.\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception, including net losses of $72.8 million, $19.4 million and $59.3 million for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, our accumulated deficit was $421.5 million. Currently, we have only one product, the HVAD System, approved for sale. We continue to incur substantial clinical trial expenditures, significant research and development costs and costs related to our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future as we incur costs associated with:\n\u2022\nconducting multiple clinical trials, including preapproval trials for new products, such as the MVAD System, and new indications for existing products, such as destination therapy, as well as post-approval trials for existing products;\n\u2022\nresearching and developing next-generation products and peripherals, such as the MVAD System, the Pal controller and the CircuLite System, as well as incremental improvements to and sustaining engineering for existing products and peripherals;\n\u2022\nintegrating and developing acquired and licensed technology;\n\u2022\nbuilding our service capabilities to meet growing customer demand;\n\u2022\ngrowing, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property;\n\u2022\nseeking and maintaining regulatory approvals and operating our quality systems, including warning letter remediation;\n\u2022\nexpanding our sales and marketing capabilities both internationally and in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nmanufacturing product and increasing our manufacturing capabilities to meet rising demand;\n\u2022\nbroadening our infrastructure in order to meet the needs of our growing operations; and\n\u2022\ncomplying with the requirements related to being a public company in the United States.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must succeed in a range of challenging activities, including all of the activities listed above. We also must, among other things, continue to reduce the per-unit cost of our products. If we are unable to increase sales and simultaneously reduce assembly, raw material, component and manufacturing overhead costs, our ability to achieve profitability will continue to be constrained. If we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain it.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness consisting primarily of our convertible senior notes. We may not be able to generate enough cash flow from our operations to service or pay principal and interest on our indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Furthermore, we may incur additional indebtedness or refinance our current indebtedness in the future, which could also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The conversion of our convertible senior notes at the election of the holders, to the extent we settle the conversion in cash, could impact our liquidity, and to the extent we settle in stock, could dilute our existing stockholders.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our indebtedness under our convertible senior notes in the principal amount of $244.8 million totaled $191.1 million, net of discounts. The indebtedness consisted of Convertible Senior Notes due December 15, 2017 in the principal amount of $42.5 million totaling $36.5 million, net of discounts, and Convertible Senior Notes due December 15, 2021 in the principal amount of $202.4 million totaling $154.6 million, net of discounts. Generally, holders may convert their Convertible Notes at their option only upon satisfaction of one or more of the conditions relating to the sale price of our common stock, the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes or specified corporate events. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. Our ability to make payments on, or to refinance, our Convertible Notes, to incur future indebtedness, and to fund planned capital expenditures, research and development efforts, working capital, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, depends on our ability to generate or access cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, clinical and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to pay our indebtedness, including payments of principal upon conversion of the Convertible Notes or upon their maturity, or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the Convertible Notes, on or before their maturity, sell assets, reduce or delay capital expenditures, seek to raise additional capital or take other similar actions. We may not be able to affect any of these actions on a timely basis at commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our financial condition at the time, the restrictions in the instruments governing our indebtedness and other factors, including market conditions. In addition, in the event of a default with respect to the Convertible Notes, the holders of the Convertible Notes and/or the trustee under the indenture governing the notes may accelerate the payment of our obligations under the notes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would likely have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our significant indebtedness combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments could have other important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in government regulation and reimbursement;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt; and\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other purposes.\nAny of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, which we are not prohibited from doing under the terms of the indenture governing the convertible senior notes, the risks related to our business and our ability to service our indebtedness would increase.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the notes is triggered, holders of the Convertible Notes will be entitled to convert the Convertible Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital. The terms of our convertible senior notes permit us to settle them, upon conversion by the holders thereof, in cash, stock or a combination thereof. To the extent we use stock for settlement, our existing stockholders may be diluted.\nWe may need substantial additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe currently spend more cash than we generate from operating revenue. Depending on a range of outcomes, especially our achievement and continuation of regulatory approval of our products and the growth of revenue, we may need to seek additional funding in the future. Additional funding may not be available when we desire on terms favorable to us, or at all. If we raise additional funding through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, our shares may suffer dilution. If we are unable to secure additional funding, our product development programs and our commercialization efforts would be delayed or reduced or may cease entirely.\nWe currently rely entirely on sales of our sole product, the HVAD System, to generate revenue. Our existing and future products may not achieve or sustain market acceptance. In addition, any factors that negatively impact sales of this product will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur sole marketed product is the HVAD System, which we introduced to the European market in January 2009 and which received regulatory approval for sale in the U.S. in late 2012. We expect to continue to derive substantially all of our revenue for the next few years from the sale of this product and its related devices. Accordingly, our ability to generate revenue is entirely reliant on our ability to market and sell this product. We expect to begin to derive limited revenue as a result of MVAD systems purchased by participating clinical trial sites pursuant to a qualified U.S. IDE study; however, clinical trials of the next generation MVAD System may adversely impact revenue derived from the current generation HVAD System. In September 2015, we voluntarily paused our MVAD System CE Mark clinical trial and the timing for restarting clinical implants, if ever, cannot be reliably projected at this time.\nEven if we are able to obtain and maintain the necessary regulatory approvals in all jurisdictions to commercialize the HVAD System or other products that we may develop, our products may not gain or sustain market acceptance among physicians, patients, health care payors or the medical community.\nThe degree of market acceptance of any of the devices that we may develop and commercialize will depend on a number of factors, including: the prevalence and severity of any adverse events or side effects especially as it relates to survival, quality of life, and patient management; potential advantages over alternative treatments or competitive products; the strength and perceived advantages of our peripherals such as the monitor, controller and batteries; and sufficient third party coverage or reimbursement.\nIf we fail to obtain and maintain adequate level of reimbursement for our products by third-party payors, there may be no commercially viable markets for our products or the markets may be much smaller than expected.\nAlthough our customers have generally achieved reimbursement for the purchase of our products to date, the availability and levels of reimbursement by governmental and other third-party payors affect the market for\nour products. Reimbursement and health care payment systems vary significantly by country, and include both government-sponsored health care and private insurance. Payors may attempt to limit coverage and the level of reimbursement of new therapeutic products or investigational devices. Government and other third-party payors also continually attempt to contain or reduce the costs of health care by challenging prices charged for health care products and services. Often, reimbursement is determined independently of, and only following, product approval, and may need to be renewed on a regular basis.\nTo obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to produce clinical and economic data, which may involve one or more clinical trials, that compares the cost-effectiveness of our products to other available therapies. In addition, the efficacy, safety, performance and cost-effectiveness of our products in comparison to competing products may determine the availability and level of reimbursement for our products.\nWe believe that future reimbursement may be subject to increased restrictions both in the United States and in international markets. Future legislation, regulation or reimbursement policies of third-party payors may adversely affect the demand for our existing products as well as products currently under development and limit our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis. We cannot predict how pending or future legislative and regulatory proposals would influence the manner in which medical devices, including ours, are purchased or covered and reimbursed.\nOn October 30, 2013, CMS issued a Decision Memo for Ventricular Assist Devices for bridge-to-transplant (\u201cBTT\u201d) and destination therapy (\u201cDT\u201d) (CAG-00432R), which updated the national coverage determination (\u201cNCD\u201d) for bridge-to-transplant and destination therapy VADs. The updated NCD, among other things, attempts to clarify BTT and DT patient selection criteria. The updated NCD clarified that BTT patients, without an exemption, must be active on the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network\u2019s waitlist for a heart in order to be eligible for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement. Since the HVAD System is currently approved in the U.S. for BTT patients only, the update to the NCD creates a subset of potential HeartWare BTT patients who may no longer be eligible for Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. The update also mandates affiliations with heart transplant centers, which limits VAD implantation at alternate care facilities. Therefore, the update may adversely affect our revenue, earnings, business or results of operation.\nIf reimbursement for our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, market acceptance of our products would be impaired and our future revenue would be materially adversely affected. Often, reimbursement is not available for products used in clinical trials as the relevant insurance providers may refuse to provide reimbursement for trial products on the basis that the products are \u201cexperimental\u201d or \u201cinvestigational\u201d and do not have the requisite regulatory approvals. As we develop next-generation products, this requirement may materially adversely affect our revenue, earnings, business and stock price.\nInvestors could lose confidence in our financial reports, and the value of our shares may be adversely affected, if our internal controls over financial reporting are found not to be effective by management or by our independent registered public accounting firm or if we make disclosure of existing or potential significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in those controls.\nManagement\u2019s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting is discussed in Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company\u2019s management, with the participation of the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. Based on that evaluation, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures, and internal control over financial reporting are effective as of December 31, 2015. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued their attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe continue to evaluate our existing internal controls over financial reporting against the standards adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB. During the course of our ongoing evaluation of the internal controls, we may identify areas requiring improvement and will design enhanced processes and controls to address any issues identified through this review. As we continue to commercialize our products, we may need to enhance our accounting and financial controls functions, particularly as they relate to accounting for revenue and inventory, and we may need to add more personnel to our financial reporting group. Remediating any deficiencies, significant deficiencies or material weaknesses that have been or could be identified by us or our independent registered public accounting firm may require us to incur significant costs and expend significant time and management resources. We cannot assure you that any of the measures we implement to remedy any deficiencies will effectively mitigate or remedy deficiencies. The existence of one or more deficiencies or weaknesses could affect the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting. Investors could lose confidence in our financial reports, and the value of our shares may be adversely affected if our internal controls over financial reporting are found not to be effective by management or by our independent registered public accounting firm or if we make disclosure of existing or potential significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in those controls.\nBusiness development activities are inherently risky, and integrating our operations with businesses we may acquire may be difficult and, if unsuccessfully executed, may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may, selectively, from time to time engage in business development activities, such as strategic acquisitions, minority investments or strategic alliances in order to complement or expand our current business or enter into a new product area. These transactions can involve significant challenges and risks, including the risk that the transaction does not advance our business strategy, results in a loss or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment. For example, as disclosed, we continue to be a minority investor in Valtech Cardio Ltd., an Israeli company, and, in connection with the termination of our Business Combination Agreement with Valtech, we made a loan to Valtech in the principal amount of $30 million pursuant to a Convertible Promissory Note. There can be no assurance that we will recognize an acceptable rate of return or other benefit from our investment in Valtech or our loan to it, or that the loan will be repaid in accordance with its terms. While our evaluation of any potential acquisition or investment includes business, clinical, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all risks. These plans are also subject to the availability of appropriate opportunities and competition from other companies seeking similar opportunities. Moreover, the success of any strategic effort may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity to finalize the development of the acquired technology and to commercialize successfully the final product.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Approval\nIn November 2012, we received approval to market the HVAD System in the U.S. as a bridge-to-heart-transplantation. Our future success depends heavily on our ability to maintain FDA approval to market our existing product for our initial indication, obtain FDA approval for additional indications, and to market our pipeline products in the U.S. and around the world.\nThe process of obtaining and maintaining marketing approval or clearance from the FDA and other regulatory authorities for our existing and future products, or enhancements or modifications to these products, could:\n\u2022\ntake a significant period of time;\n\u2022\nrequire the expenditure of substantial resources;\n\u2022\ninvolve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing as well as post-approval studies;\n\u2022\nrequire changes to our products;\n\u2022\nrequire corrective action, including recalls, with respect to products already distributed; and\n\u2022\nresult in limitations on the indicated uses of the products.\nAssuming we are able to file the required regulatory premarket approval applications for additional indications for our HVAD System as well as the initial indication of for our MVAD System and other pipeline products, there can be no assurance that we will receive the required approvals, or, if we do receive the required approvals, that we will receive them on a timely basis or for the full scope of the indication(s) requested or that we will otherwise be able to satisfy the conditions of approval, if any. In particular, because of the FDA warning letter received by HeartWare in June 2014, we are under additional regulatory scrutiny, which could increase the risk of delay in product approvals. The failure to receive product approval by the FDA, or any significant delay in receipt of approval, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to commence or complete successfully our clinical trials, or if we experience significant delays in the successful commencement or completion of our clinical trials, our ability to obtain regulatory approval to commercialize our products, and our ability to generate revenue, will be materially adversely affected.\nRegulatory approvals to sell our existing and future products both in and outside of the U.S. typically require clinical trials, which can be time consuming, unpredictable and expensive. Significant technical, bench and preclinical testing may be required prior to submitting for regulatory authorization to commence a clinical trial. The cost, timing and outcome of any of these trials or testing may be unfavorable or may be insufficient to obtain the required approvals.\nCompletion of any of our clinical trials, including our ongoing destination therapy trial, our thoracotomy trial, and particularly our MVAD System CE mark trial, and initiation of new clinical trials, including for the CircuLite System, could be delayed or adverse events during a trial could cause us to amend, repeat or terminate the trial. If this was to happen, our costs associated with the trial will increase, and it will take us longer to obtain regulatory approvals and to commercialize the product, or we may never obtain regulatory approvals. Like with our current MVAD System CE Mark clinical trial, our clinical trials may be voluntarily suspended or terminated by us at any time, including during the closing stages of enrollment and the subsequent patient follow-up period in the event that, for example, there should be an unacceptable level of adverse clinical events such as stroke, thrombus, bleeding or pump exchanges. Also, regulatory authorities, the data safety and monitoring board, or site investigational review boards could suspend or terminate a trial at any time. Any failure or significant delay in completing clinical trials for our products may materially harm our financial results and the commercial prospects for our products.\nThe completion of any of our clinical trials could be substantially delayed or prevented by several factors, including: slower than expected rates of patient recruitment and enrollment, including as a result of study inclusion and exclusion criteria; our competitors undertaking similar clinical trials at the same time as us, or having functionally comparable products that have received approval for sale; physicians or patients preferring to use approved devices or other treatments or devices rather than our devices; prevalence and severity of adverse events, such as thrombosis or stroke, and other unforeseen safety issues; and governmental and regulatory delays or changes in regulatory requirements, policies or guidelines.\nOur manufacturing facilities and the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers must comply with applicable regulatory requirements. If we or our suppliers fail to achieve and maintain regulatory approval for these or additional manufacturing facilities, our business and our results of operations would be harmed.\nCompletion of our clinical trials and commercialization of our products require access to, or the development of, manufacturing facilities that meet and maintain applicable U.S. and international regulatory\nstandards to manufacture a sufficient supply of our products. In addition, the FDA must approve facilities that manufacture our products for U.S. commercial purposes, as well as the manufacturing processes and specifications for the product, with similar, additional approvals required in order to achieve and maintain CE marking in Europe or regulatory approvals in other jurisdictions. Suppliers of components and products used to manufacture our products must also comply with FDA and foreign regulatory requirements, which often require significant time, money, resources, record-keeping and quality assurance efforts and subject us and our suppliers to potential regulatory inspections and stoppages. If we or our suppliers, particularly our single-source suppliers, fail to comply with the regulatory requirements for our manufacturing operations, our commercialization efforts could be delayed or suspended, which would harm our business and our results of operations. Our receipt of an FDA warning letter increases this risk as we are subject to a higher level of regulatory scrutiny as we work to update and improve our quality system.\nWe may not meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nEven after products have received marketing approval or clearance from the FDA or other regulatory bodies, those product approvals and clearances can be withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory standards or the occurrence of problems following initial approval whether identified through a required post-approval study or through medical device reporting. As a device manufacturer, we are required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with a variety of regulatory requirements, including the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, or \u201cQSR.\u201d The QSR is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products, including trend analysis and corrective and preventive actions. In addition, the U.S. federal medical device reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, is likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the FDA. Our failure to comply with the QSR or to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse QSR inspection or complaint information could result in enforcement actions, including a public warning letter, a shutdown of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations, delays in approving or clearing a product, refusal to permit the import or export of our products, a recall or seizure of our products, fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, or other sanctions, any of which could cause our business and operating results to materially suffer. The FDA has issued, and could issue in the future, warning letters or other communications to the Company. If we fail to satisfy or remediate the matters discussed in warning letters or communications, the FDA could take further enforcement actions as described above. Further, related remediation could require a substantial amount of money and time and could precipitate field actions, all of which could harm our business, customer confidence and our results of operations.\nIn the European Union, we are required to maintain certain ISO certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications. If we fail to continue to comply with ISO regulations, European Union organizations may withdraw clearance to market, require a product recall or take other enforcement action.\nProduct deficiencies could result in field actions, recalls, substantial costs and write-downs; this could also lead to delay or termination of ongoing trials.\nOur products are subject to various regulatory guidelines, involve complex technologies and are approved for a specified life. Identified quality problems, such as failure of critical components including batteries, controllers or driveline connectors, or the failure of third parties to supply us with sufficient conforming quantities of these products or components, could lead to adverse clinical events that could cause us to amend, repeat or terminate clinical trials, or impact the availability of our product in the marketplace. In addition, product improvements, product redundancies or failure to sell product before it expires could result in scrapping\nor expensive rework of product and our business, financial or results of operations could suffer. Product complaints, quality issues and necessary corrective and preventive actions could result in communications to customers or patients, field actions, the scrapping, rework, recall or replacement of product, substantial costs and write-offs, and harm to our business reputation and financial results. Further these activities could adversely affect our relationships with our customers or their confidence in our products which could materially adversely affect our earnings, results and financial viability.\nWe operate in multiple regulatory environments that require costly and time consuming approvals.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approvals in specific jurisdictions to commercialize the HVAD System or other products that we may develop, sales of our products in other jurisdictions will be subject to regulatory requirements that vary from country to country. The time and cost required to obtain approvals from these countries may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and requirements for registration may differ from those of the FDA. Some jurisdictions, such as Japan, may even require that we conduct additional trials. Laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our products are subject to future changes, as are administrative interpretations and policies of regulatory agencies. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign, federal, state or local market laws or regulations, we could be subject to enforcement actions. Enforcement actions could include product seizures, recalls, withdrawal of clearances or approvals, and civil and criminal penalties, which in each case would harm our business and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Operations\nWe have limited manufacturing capabilities and personnel, and if our manufacturing facilities are unable to provide an adequate supply of products, our growth could be limited and our business could be harmed.\nWe currently manufacture our HVAD System at our facilities in Miami Lakes, Florida. If there were a disruption to our manufacturing facilities or the surrounding area, for example, due to a hurricane, we would have no other means of manufacturing our HVAD System until we were able to restore the manufacturing capability at our facility or develop alternative manufacturing facilities.\nIf we are unable to ship or produce sufficient quantities of our HVAD System for sale or for use in our current and planned clinical trials, or if our manufacturing process yields substandard product, our development and commercialization efforts would be delayed. Further, if regulations restrict the way we ship our products, such as new regulations that may restrict the way we ship our lithium ion batteries, we may incur additional expense or experience distribution delays. In addition, if a regulatory authority approves or clears a new product or a new indication for the HVAD System, we may not be able to ship or manufacture additional product in the quantities needed to meet the increased commercial demand on a timely basis. Even if we are able to produce and ship sufficient quantities of our products, we may not be able to attain sufficient profitability on that production or any resultant sales.\nWe currently have limited resources, facilities and experience to commercially manufacture our products. In order to produce our products in the quantities that we anticipate will be required to meet anticipated market demand, we will need to increase the production process and efficiency over the current level of production. There are significant technical and regulatory challenges to increasing manufacturing capacity and efficiency, and continuing to develop commercial-scale manufacturing facilities will require the investment of additional funds and hiring and retaining additional management and technical personnel who have the necessary manufacturing and operational experience. We may not successfully complete any required increase in a timely or economically viable manner, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may not be able to produce the HVAD System or other products that we may develop, in sufficient quantities to meet future demand.\nIf we are unable to manufacture a sufficient or consistent supply of the HVAD System or other products we are developing, or if we cannot do so efficiently or pursuant to regulatory standards, our revenue, business and financial prospects would be adversely affected.\nWe rely on specialized suppliers for certain components and materials, and we do not have second-source suppliers for all of our components.\nWe depend on a number of suppliers to successfully manufacture sufficient quantities of the components we use in our products, both our existing commercial products and our products in development. We rely on suppliers for various critical components including the center post, housing and impeller that are assembled into our primary product, the HVAD System, as well as finished products that comprise our peripheral and external equipment included in the HVAD System. Similar relationships exist in relation to our MVAD System. Lead times for our components are significant and can be as long as sixteen weeks or longer and many of our components are manufactured to very tight tolerances and specifications. We do not presently have supply agreements with the majority of our key suppliers but have extensive purchase orders in place with these vendors.\nWe have second-source suppliers for some, but not all, of our components. In particular, we do not have second-source suppliers for our controllers, battery chargers and monitors. Our reliance on third-party suppliers also subjects us to other risks that could harm our business, including:\n\u2022\nwe do not believe that we are a major customer of some of our suppliers, in terms of the volume of components and materials that we purchase, and these suppliers may therefore give other customers\u2019 needs higher priority than ours or discontinue or modify components based on demand or lack of demand from other customers;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022\nsome of our components are extraordinarily complex and must be manufactured to extremely tight tolerances and specifications with the result that our suppliers, especially new suppliers, may make errors in manufacturing that could negatively affect the efficacy or safety of our products or cause our components not to be delivered on time or at all or to be delivered outside of our specifications;\n\u2022\nthe availability of second-source suppliers may be extremely limited or their implementation as a supplier may be lengthy due to the tight tolerances and specifications in which we typically operate as well as regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nswitching components or changes to our components, specifications or designs may require product redesign and regulatory submissions, which can lead to production interruptions; and\n\u2022\nour suppliers and their sub-suppliers may encounter financial hardships unrelated to our demand, which could inhibit their ability to fulfill our orders and meet our requirements.\nAny interruption or delay in obtaining products from our third-party suppliers, or our inability to obtain products from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and cause them to cancel orders or switch to competing products.\nWhile we have identified second-source suppliers for other key components, we have not entered into written agreements with these suppliers and we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing schedule without undue delay or substantial cost if any of these arrangements is terminated.\nAdditionally, we may experience problems or delays in our own manufacturing and assembly processes, which may be harmful to our financial status or reputation and, therefore, make it more difficult or expensive for us to continue with, or enter into relationships with, specialized suppliers. Our business plan is predicated on maintaining strong relationships and favorable supply arrangements with a series of external parties to manufacture components of our HVAD System and other products we may develop, such as the MVAD System. If we are unsuccessful in this regard or are unable to secure or maintain agreements with these manufacturers on favorable terms or at all, then our ability to commercialize our technology and expand our operations will be dramatically impaired.\nWe use external consultants and engineers to help us develop new products and peripherals as well as components for our current products and peripherals. Many of these external projects anticipate innovation or technology development that does not currently exist and are funded on a time and materials basis. As a result,\nthe ability of third-party contractors to develop the necessary technology in accordance with established budgets and timelines is uncertain. Failure to timely execute a development program could result in the delay or abandonment of a new product or component or increase the cost of the activity. These outcomes could adversely impact our business, prospects and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Future Growth\nIf we are unable to manage our expected growth, we may not be able to meet market demand, generate expected benefits from the opportunities available to us, satisfy quality regulations or commercialize our products.\nWe expect to continue to expand our operations and grow our research and development, product development, quality, regulatory, manufacturing, sales, marketing and administrative operations. This expansion has placed, and is expected to continue to place, a significant strain on our management, infrastructure, information technology, operational and financial resources. To manage continued growth and to commercialize our products, we will be required to improve existing operational, quality and financial systems, procedures and controls and expand, train and manage our employee base. In addition, we will need to manage relationships with various third parties and external entities participating in our research and development efforts, clinical trials, quality systems, manufacturers, suppliers and other organizations, including various regulatory bodies in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. We have begun to implement systemic changes and organizational improvements to address the items raised by the FDA in our warning letter. We may not be able to implement needed improvements in an efficient and timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls, which may require remediation such as process enhancements and field actions. Our failure to accomplish any of these tasks could materially harm our business and prospects.\nFurther, we have aggressively expanded, and expect to continue to expand, into foreign markets. Expansion into additional foreign markets imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel, research, regulatory and sales departments and generally limited managerial resources. Our efforts to introduce our current or future products into additional foreign markets may not be successful, in which case we may have expended significant resources without realizing the expected benefit. Ultimately, the investments required for expansion into additional foreign markets could exceed the returns, if any, generated from this expansion. The taxation and customs requirements, together with other applicable laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions, can be inherently complex and subject to differing interpretation by local authorities. We are subject to the risk that either we have misinterpreted applicable laws and regulations or that foreign authorities may take inconsistent, unclear or changing positions on local law, customs practices or rules. In the event that we have misinterpreted local requirements, or that foreign authorities take positions contrary to ours, we may incur liabilities that may differ materially from the amounts accrued in our financial statements.\nDestination therapy procedures represent an increasing share of ventricular assist device implants. Although we are currently conducting destination therapy trials and plan to submit an application for PMA approval to the FDA, we may be unable to obtain destination therapy approval for several years.\nHospitals must meet specific regulatory or reimbursement requirements in order to perform destination therapy procedures. These requirements and national coverage determinations may change from time to time. We are currently conducting clinical trials to study the use of the HVAD System for destination therapy. If reimbursement is reduced, or if the requirements are modified, or if physicians decline to use our products for destination therapy in the future, our market opportunities will be diminished and our business and stock price may be adversely impacted. The number of destination therapy procedures actually performed depends on many factors, most of which are out of our direct control, including:\n\u2022\nthe number of sites approved for destination therapy by relevant regulatory agencies;\n\u2022\nthe clinical outcomes, and physician presentations of clinical outcomes, of our destination therapy trials and destination therapy procedures, in general;\n\u2022\nimplanting surgeons\u2019 and referring cardiologists\u2019 commitment to destination therapy;\n\u2022\nthe economics of VADs for destination therapy at individual hospitals, which includes the costs of the VAD and related pre- and post-operative procedures and treatment and their reimbursement; and\n\u2022\nthe economics of hospitals not conducting a destination therapy procedure, including the costs and related reimbursements of long-term hospitalization of patients with advanced heart failure and alternative therapies.\nThe different outcomes of these and other factors, and their timing, may have a material and adverse effect on our future results.\nIn addition, our primary competitor has received a destination therapy indication for its current product and is seeking a destination therapy indication for its new product. If physicians grow accustomed to those devices for destination therapy and become unwilling to use our device for this indication, our ability to participate in and benefit from this opportunity may suffer.\nIf we fail to successfully introduce next-generation products and improvements to our existing product, our future growth may suffer.\nAs part of our strategy, we intend to develop and introduce a number of next-generation products and make enhancements to our existing products. We also intend to develop new indications for our existing products. If we are slow in bringing new products to market or otherwise fail to successfully develop, manufacture, design clinical trials for, introduce or commercialize any of these new products, product improvements or new indications on a timely basis, or if they are not well-accepted by the market or third party payors, our future growth may suffer. For example, we are developing a next-generation system based on our MVAD pump technology, designing a new and improved controller and conducting a clinical trial for a thoracotomy placement, among others. If we are not successful in these efforts, among others, our future business opportunities and growth potential will suffer.\nBusiness development activities are inherently risky, and integrating our operations with businesses we may acquire may be difficult and, if unsuccessfully executed, may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may, selectively, from time to time engage in business development activities, such as strategic acquisitions, like our acquisitions of World Heart Corporation and CircuLite, Inc., our contemplated acquisition of Valtech Cardio, Ltd., and other investments and alliances in order to complement or expand our current business or enter into a new market. These transactions can involve significant costs, challenges and risks, including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy, requires significant ongoing investment, or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment. While our evaluation of any potential acquisition or investment includes business, clinical, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved, we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all risks. These plans are also subject to the availability of appropriate opportunities and competition from other companies seeking similar opportunities. Moreover, the success of any strategic effort may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity, to finalize the development of the acquired technology and to commercialize successfully the final product.\nEach acquisition involves the integration of a separate company that was previously operated independently and has different systems, processes, policies and cultures. The process of combining companies may be disruptive to our businesses and may cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, both of the businesses. Further, these challenges could materially harm our stock price, business, financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to successfully integrate strategic acquisitions in a timely manner, our business and our growth strategies could be negatively affected. Even if we are able to successfully complete the integration of\nthe operations of other companies or businesses we may acquire in the future, we may not be able to realize all or any of the benefits that we expect to result from the integration, either in monetary terms or in a timely manner.\nWe may choose to license or acquire products or technologies, in addition to, or instead of, developing them ourselves. We cannot be certain that these efforts will be successful or that we will realize any revenue from them.\nWe license or acquire products and technologies under licensing, purchasing and other agreements. In addition to active internal and external research and development efforts, we may seek, from time to time, to license or acquire new products or technologies to supplement or replace products or technologies. License and acquisition of technology involves numerous risks, including the inability to successfully license or acquire the desired product or technology on terms favorable to us or at all, the incurrence of significant financial commitments to third parties, and the risks associated with third parties terminating licenses arrangements if we do not perform as required under the agreements.\nIn addition, third parties may breach or terminate their license agreements with us or fail to conduct their activities in connection with our relationships in a timely manner. If we or our counterparties terminate or breach any of our licenses we may:\n\u2022\nlose our right to develop and market certain intellectual property;\n\u2022\nexperience delays in the development or commercialization of our product;\n\u2022\nlitigate or arbitrate disputes, both of which are time-consuming and expensive and have uncertain outcomes;\n\u2022\nincur liability for damages; and\n\u2022\nbe unable to obtain any other similar licenses on acceptable terms, if at all.\nAny of these factors could materially harm our stock price, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nExpansion into medical centers that have not historically used our products may incur long sales and training cycles that may cause our product sales and operating results to vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter.\nOur VAD systems have lengthy sales cycles and we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant effort without making a sale. Even after making the decision to purchase our VAD systems, our customers often deploy our products slowly, and this time period may be extended if our products are acquired on a consignment basis, as is the case for some of our customers. In addition, cardiac centers that buy the majority of our products are usually led by physicians who are heavily recruited by competing centers or by centers looking to increase their profiles. When one of these physicians moves to a new center we sometimes experience a temporary but significant reduction in purchases by the center from which the surgeon has departed while it replaces its lead surgeon. As a result, it is difficult for us to predict the quarter in which customers may purchase our VAD systems and our product sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. In addition, product purchases often lag initial expressions of interest in our product by new centers as training of the VAD team and internal hospital administrative procedures is typically required prior to the initial implant procedures.\nRisks Related to Competition\nWe compete against companies that have longer operating histories, more established or approved products and greater resources than we do, which may prevent us from achieving further market penetration or improving operating results.\nCompetition in the medical device industry is intense. Our products will compete against products offered by public companies, such as St. Jude Medical, Inc. (which acquired Thoratec Corporation in October 2015) and Sunshine Heart, Inc., as well as several private companies, such as Jarvik Heart, Inc. and ReliantHeart Inc. Some of these competitors, particularly St. Jude Medical, Inc., have significantly greater financial and human resources than we do, have established reputations or approved products or significantly greater name recognition than we do, and have significantly larger and more established distribution channels and sales and marketing capabilities than we do. For example, St. Jude Medical, Inc. has received a CE Mark for its next-generation HeartMate III device, has commenced a U.S. clinical trial for its HeartMate III device and has marketing approval in the U.S. for its HeartMate II device for both destination and bridge-to-transplant indications. Our HVAD System, which is our only commercial product, is currently approved in the U.S. for the bridge-to-transplant indication only. We are likely to compete with new companies in the future as additional competitors enter the market. We also face competition from other medical therapies, which may focus on our target markets as well as competition from manufacturers of pharmaceutical treatments and other devices that are currently in development.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to distinguish our company and our products from our competitors and their products. Factors affecting our competitive position include:\n\u2022\nthe availability of other products and procedures, such as heart transplants and pharmaceuticals;\n\u2022\nproduct performance and design;\n\u2022\nproduct safety;\n\u2022\nsales, marketing and distribution capabilities;\n\u2022\ncomparable clinical outcomes;\n\u2022\nphysician acceptance of our products;\n\u2022\nsuccess and timing of new product development and introductions;\n\u2022\npenetration into existing and new geographic markets; and\n\u2022\nintellectual property protection.\nThe competition for qualified personnel is particularly intense in our industry. In addition, we have added or made changes to executive personnel during 2015 and may continue to do so as our needs evolve. If we are unable to retain or hire executive and other key personnel, we may not be able to sustain or grow our business.\nOur ability to operate successfully and manage our potential future growth depends significantly upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified research, technical, clinical, regulatory, sales, marketing, managerial, legal and financial personnel. We have hired, and expect to continue to hire, a substantial number of employees in these areas and others in order to support U.S. commercialization and the expected growth in our global business. However, we face intense competition for qualified personnel, and we may not be able to attract, retain and motivate these individuals. We compete for talent with numerous companies, as well as hospitals, universities and non-profit research organizations. Our future success also depends on the personal efforts and abilities of the principal members of our senior management and scientific staff to provide strategic direction, management of our operations and maintenance of a cohesive and stable working environment. Although we have employment and incentive compensation agreements with all of our executive officers and incentive and compensation plans for our other personnel providing them with various economic incentives to\nremain employed with us, these incentives may not be sufficient to retain them. We do not maintain key-man life insurance on the lives of any of the members of our senior management. The loss of key personnel for any reason or our inability to hire, retain and motivate additional qualified personnel in the future could prevent us from sustaining or growing our business.\nRisks Related to Product Liability\nWe manufacture a complex medical device implanted in the heart that subjects us to numerous risks. Product liability claims could damage our reputation or adversely affect our business.\nThere are risks associated with implanting our device in patients with end-stage heart failure, including, but not limited to, death, bleeding, stroke, device malfunction and other adverse events. Should our customers experience an increase in adverse events, they may reduce their usage or purchase of our device. In addition, should our patients experience injury due to these events, they or regulatory authorities may pursue legal or administrative action against us. Any of these occurrences could have a materially adverse impact on our operations and financial results and conditions as well as customer confidence in us or our products. Specifically, product liability and similar claims may be expensive to defend and may result in large judgments against us. A product liability or other damages claim, product recall or product misuse, regardless of the ultimate outcome, could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages and could seriously harm our business. We maintain limited clinical trial insurance and product liability insurance. We cannot be certain that insurance will be sufficient to cover all claims that may be made against us. Our insurance policies generally must be renewed on an annual basis. We may not be able to maintain or increase insurance on acceptable terms or at reasonable costs. Claims against us, regardless of their merit, could result in significant awards against us that could materially adversely harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects. A product liability or other damages claim, product recall or product misuse involving any type of VAD, but especially involving one of ours, could also materially and adversely damage our reputation and the perception of VADs generally and affect our ability to attract and retain customers, irrespective of whether or not the claim or action was meritorious.\nRisks Related to the Economy and Public Policy Relevant to our Business\nAdverse changes in general economic conditions in the United States and overseas could adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in general economic market conditions. Many global economies remain sluggish as they recover from a severe recession and unprecedented turmoil. The U.S. and other developed economies continue to suffer from market volatility, rising healthcare costs, difficulties in the financial services sector, tight credit markets, concerns of inflation, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, significant job losses or slower than expected job creation, reduced consumer spending, and continuing economic uncertainties. The turmoil and the uncertainty about future economic conditions could negatively impact our current and prospective customers, adversely affect the financial ability of governments and health insurers to pay claims, adversely impact our expenses and ability to obtain financing of our operations, cause delays or other problems with key suppliers and increase the risk of counterparty failures. Since the use of the HVAD System in a patient is generally dependent on the availability of third-party reimbursement and normally requires the patient to make a significant co-payment, the pace of the global recovery will continue to influence our potential customers and may negatively affect customer orders. Similarly, the impacts of the challenging economy on our existing customers may cause some of them to cease purchasing, or lower or delay reimbursement for HVAD Systems and this will reduce our revenue, which in turn will make it more difficult to achieve the per-unit cost savings, which are expected to be attained through increases in our manufacturing volume.\nThe severe recession impacted the financial stability of many public and private health insurers. As a result, insurers continue to scrutinize claims more rigorously and delay or deny reimbursement more often. Although\nVAD procedures occur in relatively limited numbers, the per-procedure reimbursement levels may draw the attention of third-party payors. Since the sale of the HVAD System is generally dependent on the availability of third-party reimbursement, any delay or decline in reimbursement will adversely affect our revenue.\nGlobal market and economic conditions may exacerbate certain risks affecting our business.\nInternational markets, especially Europe and the Middle East, represent a major part of our present business. Approximately 42% of our 2015 revenues were derived from international sales and a significant amount of our marketing efforts are focused on European and Middle Eastern countries. Although not materially impacted to date, our accounts receivable in certain European countries may be subject to significant payment delays due to government funding and reimbursement practices or limited financial flexibility of our distributors. Some foreign governments have announced or implemented austerity measures to constrain the overall level of government expenditures, which may include reforming health care coverage and reducing health care costs. These measures will continue to exert pressure on our customers and may impact their ability to pay for product on a timely basis or to maintain their current purchasing patterns. These adverse market and economic conditions could reduce our product sales and revenue, result in additional allowances, or reduce credit sales to our distribution network. In addition, some European and other payors require health technology assessments or economic cost-benefit analyses to be conducted by a manufacturer or third-party analysis group in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement of medical devices. These analyses can be expensive and time consuming, and may not produce outcomes favorable to us. Adverse or delayed outcomes will adversely affect our revenue. Similar obstacles may delay our expansion into new markets or reduce the expected benefits of entry into new markets.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates can affect the value of our assets, liabilities, costs and revenue. For example, strengthening of the U.S. dollar had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of approximately 7%, or $19.2 million, on our reported revenue in 2015. In 2015, approximately 37% of our revenue was sourced from international sales denominated in foreign currencies, mainly in Europe and principally in Euros, while most of our expenditures are incurred in U.S. dollars.\nWith limited exceptions, our international sales are denominated in Euros or in local currencies, not U.S. dollars, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, especially an appreciation of the U.S. dollar against major international currencies, will materially impact our revenue and earnings. Due to the size and stage of development of our operations and revenue, we do not presently mitigate our exposure to exchange risk to a significant extent other than by holding the majority of our funds in U.S. dollars or U.S. dollar-denominated investments.\nHealthcare policy changes, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, may have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years, there have been, and continue to be, proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payors to control these costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. Certain of these proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products. Moreover, as discussed in the paragraph below, the Affordable Care Act imposes significant taxes on medical device makers such as us. The Affordable Care Act and other proposals could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nOn March 23, 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law by President Obama. On March 30, 2010, a companion bill, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the \u201cReconciliation Act\u201d) was also signed into law by President Obama. Among other things, the Affordable Care Act and the Reconciliation Act (collectively, the \u201cActs\u201d), when taken together, impose a 2.3% excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices.\nAlthough the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (Pub. L. 114-113), signed into law on December 18, 2015, includes a two year moratorium on the 2.3% excise tax, whether this tax, or any other new tax or regulation, may apply to us in the future is uncertain.\nOther elements of the Acts such as comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, transparency requirements, payment system reforms, including shared savings pilots and other provisions could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered, and may materially impact numerous aspects of our business.\nWe are subject to federal and state laws prohibiting \u201ckickbacks\u201d and false or fraudulent claims, which, if violated, could subject us to substantial penalties. Foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may have similar laws. Other laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and the U.K. Bribery Act prohibit improper payments to government officials to induce the purchase of products or similar actions. Any challenge to, or investigation into, our practices under these laws are costly to defend, might result in fines and penalties and could cause adverse publicity, thus causing harm to our business and operations. In addition, we can be held liable for our distributors\u2019 failure to comply with these laws.\nA federal law commonly known as the Anti-Kickback Law, and several similar state and foreign laws, prohibit payments that are intended to induce physicians or others either to refer patients or to acquire or arrange for or recommend the acquisition of healthcare products or services. These laws constrain our sales, marketing and other promotional activities by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements, including sales programs, we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers of medical devices. Other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or for items or services that were not provided as claimed. Because we may provide some coding and billing information to purchasers of the HVAD System and our other products, and because we cannot assure that the government will regard any billing errors that may be made as inadvertent, these laws are potentially applicable to us. In addition, these laws are potentially applicable to us because we may provide training reimbursement and other payments to healthcare professionals and institutions. Anti-kickback and false claims laws prescribe civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance, which can be substantial.\nThe FCPA and the United Kingdom\u2019s Bribery Act prohibit improper payments to government officials to induce inappropriate behavior. In many jurisdictions, hospitals are owned or operated by governmental authorities, and physicians and administrators who are employed by the hospital may be considered to be a government official. As a result, certain relationships with our customers could expose us to liability under these statutes. Corrupt practices and anti-bribery laws prescribe civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance, which can be substantial. Even an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices is costly to defend, and could cause adverse publicity, and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, we may be liable for the actions of our distributors to the extent they do not comply with these laws.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property and Confidential Information\nWe may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain protection in the United States and other countries of the intellectual property relating to or incorporated into our technology and products. Our patent portfolio consists of internally developed technology as well as patents and patent applications which we licensed or acquired from others. In addition, from time to time, we also acquire or license technology from third parties.\nAs a result, we may have less complete knowledge and records with respect to the development and ownership of acquired and third-party technology, patents and intellectual property than we would otherwise have for technology, patents and intellectual property developed internally by us.\nOur pending and future patent applications may not issue as patents or, if issued, may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection or any competitive advantage. Even if issued, existing or future patents may be challenged, narrowed, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from developing and marketing similar products or limit the length of terms of patent protection we may have for our products. Further, other companies may design around technologies we have patented, licensed or developed. Moreover, changes in patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries could also diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. In addition, the legal systems of certain countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar to ours.\nWe may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive and, if we lose, could cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights, which would harm our ability to compete in the market.\nWe rely on patents to protect a portion of our intellectual property and our competitive position. Patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving and, consequently, patent positions in the medical device industry are generally uncertain. In order to protect or enforce our patent rights, we may initiate patent litigation against third parties, such as infringement suits or interference proceedings. Litigation may be necessary to:\n\u2022\nassert claims of infringement;\n\u2022\nenforce our patents;\n\u2022\nprotect our trade secrets or know-how; or\n\u2022\ndetermine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others.\nAny lawsuits that we initiate could be expensive, take significant time and divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. Litigation also puts our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. Additionally, we may provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially valuable. The occurrence of any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nClaims that our current or future products infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others could adversely affect our ability to sell those products and cause us to incur additional costs.\nSubstantial litigation over intellectual property rights exists in the medical device industry. We expect that we could be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as our revenue increases, the number of technology holders grows, competition expands and the functionality of products and technology in different industry segments overlaps. Third parties may currently have, or may eventually be issued, patents on which our current or future products or technologies may allegedly infringe.\nThere can be no certainty that litigation will not arise in relation to third-party intellectual property or, if it does arise, whether or not it will be determined in a manner which is favorable to us. Any litigation, regardless of its outcome, would likely result in the expenditure of significant financial resources and the diversion of management\u2019s time and resources. In addition, litigation in which we are accused of infringement may cause\nnegative publicity, adversely impact prospective customers, cause product shipment delays, prohibit us from manufacturing, marketing or selling our current or future products, require us to develop non-infringing technology, make substantial payments to third parties or enter into royalty or license agreements, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all. If a successful claim of infringement was made against us and we could not develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and cost-effective basis, our revenue may decrease substantially and we could be exposed to significant liability. A court could enter orders that temporarily, preliminarily or permanently enjoin us or our customers from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our current or future products, or could enter an order mandating that we undertake certain remedial activities. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties can have a similar negative impact on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information and know-how, the value of our technology and products could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely on a combination of non-patented proprietary technology, trade secrets, processes and procedures, technical knowledge and know-how accumulated or acquired since inception. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or misappropriated. We generally seek to protect this information by confidentiality, non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and third parties. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may be disclosed to or otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. If our intellectual property is disclosed or misappropriated, it would harm our ability to protect our rights and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims that we or our employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of former employers of our employees.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at other medical device companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. To the extent that our employees are involved in research areas that are similar to those in which they were involved with their former employers, we may be subject to claims that such employees have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business and as required by regulatory authorities, we collect and store sensitive data, including certain patient tracking information and information related to our clinical sites. We also maintain in confidence intellectual property, proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our employees, on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Further, the FDA has recently issued additional cyber-security guidance that encourages medical device manufactures to conduct risk assessment and monitoring, routine device cyber maintenance and necessary actions to mitigate device functionality and patient safety risks. Despite our security measures, such as limiting access to information, reviewing and updating device software and utilizing password protection, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, remediation costs, regulatory penalties, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disruption of our operations and the services we provide to\ncustomers, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could adversely affect our business/operating margins, revenues and competitive position.\nIf we are found to have violated laws protecting the confidentiality of patient health information, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities and harm our reputation or our business.\nThere are a number of federal and state and foreign laws protecting the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient records, and restricting the use and disclosure of that protected information. In particular, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services promulgated patient privacy rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. These privacy rules protect medical records and other personal health information by limiting their use and disclosure, giving individuals the right to access, amend and seek accounting of their own health information and limiting most use and disclosures of health information to the minimum amount reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. If we are found to be in violation of the privacy rules under HIPAA or similar laws (to the extent applicable to us), we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities, harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. European privacy laws are generally more stringent than similar laws in the U.S. Since a significant amount of our revenue and business relationships arise in Europe, we may be at risk should we fail to comply with local requirements even if we have complied with U.S. regulations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nShares of our common stock were listed for trading on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC on February 24, 2009. Trading commenced the following day. Prior to that time, there had been no public market for our common stock in the United States. The closing price of our shares of common stock traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC has ranged from U.S. $35.21 to U.S. $94.47 in the period from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015. The price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including future announcements or new information concerning us or our competitors, reimbursement or the potential market for our products.\nIn addition, stock markets in general and the market for shares of healthcare stocks in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years, fluctuations that frequently have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our shares. The market price of our shares could decline below its current price and the market price of our shares may fluctuate significantly in the future. These fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance.\nWe are subject to litigation risks, including securities class action and product liability litigation, which may be costly to defend and the outcome of which is uncertain.\nAll industries, including the medical device industry, are subject to legal claims, with and without merit. We are subject to various legal claims in the ordinary course of our business. In addition, on January 22, 2016, the St. Paul Teachers\u2019 Retirement Fund Association filed a putative class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired shares of the Company from June 10, 2014 through January 11, 2016. We can provide no assurance as to the outcome of this litigation or any other litigation matter in which we are a party. In particular, securities class action lawsuits are typically costly to defend and, accordingly, even if resolved in our favor, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. This litigation could also substantially divert the attention of our management and our resources in general.\nUncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of securities class action litigation or other litigation also could harm our ability to obtain credit, insurance and financing for our operations, maintain investor and customer confidence and compete in the marketplace. We can provide no assurance that additional litigation, including securities class action litigation, will not be filed against us in the future. See Part I, Item 3 \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for more information on our legal proceedings.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our shares, and we currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain any earnings to finance the development and expansion of our products and business. Accordingly, our stockholders will not realize a return on their investment unless the trading price of our shares appreciates.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may discourage a third party from acquiring us, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 opportunities to sell their shares at a premium.\nCertain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws may be considered as having an anti-takeover effect, such as those provisions establishing a classified board of directors, consisting of three classes of directors, and requiring that directors be removed only for cause, authorizing the board of directors to issue from time to time any series of preferred stock and fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of such series of preferred stock, prohibiting stockholders from acting by written consent in lieu of a meeting, requiring advance notice of stockholder intention to put forth director nominees or bring up other business at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, and prohibiting stockholders from calling a special meeting of stockholders. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which in general prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless certain conditions specified therein are satisfied. These provisions could have the effect of depriving our stockholders of an opportunity to sell their shares at a premium over prevailing market prices by discouraging third parties from seeking to obtain control of us in a tender offer or similar transaction.\nWe may undergo an \u201cownership change\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which would limit our ability to utilize net operating losses from prior tax years.\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have incurred net losses since our inception. If we undergo an \u201cownership change\u201d for U.S. federal income tax purposes, our ability to utilize net operating loss carry-forwards from prior years to reduce taxable income in future tax years might be limited by operation of the Internal Revenue Code, either by limiting the amount of net operating losses that can be utilized to offset taxable income in a given year, or in total over the entire carry-forward period. Certain changes in the ownership of our common stock may result in an ownership change sufficient to limit the availability of our net operating losses.", "PERMNO": 92894, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "HTWR"}
