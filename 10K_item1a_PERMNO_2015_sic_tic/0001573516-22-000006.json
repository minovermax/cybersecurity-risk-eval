{"cik": "1573516", "company": "Murphy USA Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks, and, as a result, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Relating to our Company\nOur operations present hazards and risks, which may not be fully covered by insurance, if insured. If a significant accident or event occurs for which we are not adequately insured, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected.\nThe scope and nature of our operations present a variety of operational hazards and risks, including explosions, fires, toxic emissions, and natural catastrophes that must be managed through continual oversight and control. These and other risks are present throughout our operations. As protection against these hazards and risks, we maintain insurance against many, but not all, potential losses or liabilities arising from such risks. Uninsured losses and liabilities arising from operating risks could reduce the funds available to us for capital and investment spending and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur indebtedness could restrict our business and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows; our leverage could increase the overall cost of debt funding and decrease the overall debt capacity and commercial credit available to us in the future.\nWe have debt obligations that could restrict our business and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. This outstanding indebtedness could have significant consequences to our future operations, including:\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our outstanding debt;\n\u2022resulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable;\n\u2022reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy; and\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged.\nAny of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our credit facilities and the indentures that govern the notes include restrictive covenants that, subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, restrict or limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, make certain investments, sell certain assets and enter into certain strategic transactions, including mergers and acquisitions. These covenants and restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business, and may limit our ability to react to market conditions or take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.\nOur leverage may increase the overall cost of debt funding and decrease the overall debt capacity and commercial credit available to us. Our leverage could increase with additional borrowings on our shelf registration statement. We have below investment-grade ratings on our notes from Moody\u2019s and S&P while our credit facilities are rated investment grade. Our credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a ratings agency if, in its judgment, the circumstances warrant. If our existing ratings are lowered, or otherwise we do not obtain an investment grade rating in the future for the notes, or if we do and a rating agency were to downgrade us again to below investment grade, our borrowing costs would increase and our funding sources could decrease. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade, could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and operating results.\nThe interest rates on our credit facilities may be impacted by the phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") and the transition to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\").\nInterest rates on borrowings under our credit agreement may be based on LIBOR. Following announcements by the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) and ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, the FCA-regulated LIBOR administrator, publication of the one-week and two-month United States Dollar (\u201cUSD\u201d)-LIBOR tenors ceased after December 31, 2021. While publication of all other USD-LIBOR tenors is expected to cease after June 30, 2023, U.S. regulators and the FCA have published guidance instructing banks to cease entering into new contracts referencing USD-LIBOR no later than December 31, 2021, with limited exceptions.\nAs of the date hereof, the current recommended replacement for USD-LIBOR is the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). In March 2020, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing 30-, 90- and 180-day tenor SOFR Averages and a SOFR Index. In addition, forward-looking SOFR term rates are being published. However, the composition and characteristics of SOFR are not the same as those of LIBOR. As a result, there can be no assurance that SOFR or any rate based on SOFR will perform in the same way as LIBOR would have at any time. For example, since publication of SOFR began on April 3, 2018, daily changes in SOFR have, on occasion, been more volatile than daily changes in comparable benchmark or other market rates.\nAny transition away from LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate is complex and may affect the cost of servicing our debt under our credit agreement. Although these borrowing arrangements provide for alternative base rates, the composition and characteristics of such alternative base rates are not the same as those of LIBOR, and the consequences of the phase-out of LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted at this time.\nOur ability to meet our payment obligations under the notes and our other debt depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future.\nOur ability to meet our payment and other obligations under our debt instruments, including the notes, depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot provide assurance that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit agreement or any future credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the notes and our other debt and to fund other liquidity needs. If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, including the notes, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments, or seek to raise additional capital. If we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under the notes and our other debt.\nDespite our current indebtedness levels, we may be able to incur substantially more debt. This could exacerbate further the risks associated with our leverage.\nWe and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, in the future, subject to the terms of the indentures governing the notes and our credit agreement that limit our ability to do so. Such additional indebtedness may include additional notes, which will also be guaranteed by the guarantors, to the extent permitted by the indentures and our credit agreement. Although the indentures limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to create liens securing indebtedness, there are significant exceptions to these limitations that will allow us and our subsidiaries to secure significant amounts of indebtedness without equally and ratably securing the notes. If we or our subsidiaries incur secured indebtedness and such secured indebtedness is either accelerated or becomes subject to a bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, our and our subsidiaries' assets would be used to satisfy obligations with respect to the indebtedness secured thereby before any payment could be made on the notes that are not similarly secured. In addition, the indentures governing the Senior Notes will not prevent us or our subsidiaries from incurring other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nIn connection with our Separation from Murphy Oil, Murphy Oil has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we have agreed to indemnify Murphy Oil for certain liabilities. If we are required to act under these indemnities to Murphy Oil, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted. The Murphy Oil indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of liabilities for which it will be allocated responsibility, and Murphy Oil may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations to us in the future.\nPursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement (\"the Separation\") and certain other agreements with Murphy Oil, Murphy Oil has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we have agreed to indemnify Murphy Oil for certain liabilities. Indemnities that we may be required to provide Murphy Oil are not subject to any cap, may be significant and could negatively impact our business, particularly indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the distribution. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Murphy Oil has agreed to retain, and under certain circumstances, we may be subject to continuing contingent liabilities of Murphy Oil following the Separation. Further, Murphy Oil may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Murphy Oil any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nVolatility in the global prices of oil and petroleum products and general economic conditions that are largely out of our control, as well as seasonal variations in fuel pricing, can significantly affect our operating results.\nOur net income is significantly affected by changes in the margins on retail and wholesale gasoline marketing operations. Oil and domestic wholesale gasoline markets are volatile. General political conditions, acts of war or terrorism, instability in oil producing regions, particularly in the Middle East and South America, and the value of U.S. dollars relative to other foreign currencies, particularly those of oil producing nations, could significantly affect oil supplies and wholesale gasoline costs. In addition, the supply of gasoline and our wholesale purchase costs could be adversely affected in the event of a shortage, which could result from, among other things, lack of capacity at oil refineries, sustained increase in global demand or the fact that our gasoline contracts do not guarantee an uninterrupted, unlimited supply of gasoline. Our wholesale purchase costs could also be adversely affected by increasingly stringent regulations regarding the content and characteristics of fuel products. Significant increases and volatility in wholesale gasoline costs could result in lower gasoline gross margins per gallon. This volatility makes it extremely difficult to predict the effect that future wholesale cost fluctuations will have on our operating results and financial condition in future periods.\nExcept in limited cases, we typically do not seek to hedge any significant portion of our exposure to the effects of changing prices of commodities. Dramatic increases in oil prices reduce retail gasoline gross margins, because wholesale gasoline costs typically increase faster than retailers are able to pass them along to customers. We purchase refined products, particularly gasoline, needed to supply our retail stores. Therefore, our most significant costs are subject to volatility of prices for these commodities. Our ability to successfully manage operating costs is important because we have little or no influence on the sales prices or regional and worldwide consumer demand for oil and gasoline. Furthermore, oil prices, wholesale motor fuel costs, motor fuel sales\nvolumes, motor fuel gross margins and merchandise sales can be subject to seasonal fluctuations. For example, consumer demand for motor fuel typically increases during the summer driving season, and typically falls during the winter months. Travel, recreation and construction are typically higher in these months in the geographic areas in which we operate, increasing the demand for motor fuel and merchandise that we sell. Therefore, our revenues and/or sales volumes are typically higher in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year. A significant change in any of these factors, including a significant decrease in consumer demand (other than typical seasonal variations), could materially affect our motor fuel and merchandise volumes, motor fuel gross profit and overall customer traffic, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurther, recessionary economic conditions, higher interest rates, higher gasoline and other energy costs, inflation, increases in commodity prices, higher levels of unemployment, higher consumer debt levels, higher tax rates and other changes in tax laws or other economic factors may affect consumer spending or buying habits, and could adversely affect the demand for products we sell at our retail stores. Unfavorable economic conditions, higher gasoline prices and unemployment levels can affect consumer confidence, spending patterns and vehicle miles driven. These factors can lead to sales declines in both gasoline and general merchandise, and in turn have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWalmart continues to be a key relationship with regard to our Murphy USA network.\nAt December 31, 2021, most of our Murphy branded stores were located in close proximity to Walmart Supercenter stores. Therefore, our relationship with Walmart, the continued goodwill of Walmart and the integrity of Walmart\u2019s brand name in the retail marketplace are all important drivers for our business. Any deterioration in our relationship with Walmart could have an adverse effect on operations of the stores that are branded Murphy USA and participate in a discount. In addition, our competitive posture could be weakened by negative changes at Walmart. Many of our Company stores benefit from customer traffic generated by Walmart retail stores, and if the customer traffic through these host stores decreases due to the economy or for any other reason, our sales could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe current level of revenue that is generated from RINs may not be sustainable.\nMurphy USA's business is impacted by its ability to generate revenues from capturing and subsequently selling Renewable Identification Numbers (\"RINs\"), a practice enabled through the blending of petroleum-based fuels with renewable fuels. RIN prices also have an impact on our cost of goods sold for petroleum products, which can be positive or negative depending on the movement of RIN prices. The market price for RINs fluctuates based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to governmental and regulatory action and market dynamics. In 2021, RIN prices continued to fluctuate but were higher on average due to uncertainty of future regulations. Although a decline in RIN prices could have a material impact on the Company's revenues, Murphy USA's business model is not dependent on its ability to generate revenues from the sale of RINs.\nCurrent litigation and future rule making could impact the present point of obligation under the Renewable Fuel Standard (\"RFS\") program. The RFS program is the regulatory means by which the federal government requires the introduction of an increasing amount of renewable fuel into the fuel supply. As it is, refiners are obligated to obtain-either by blending biofuels into petroleum-based fuels or through purchase on the open market-and then retire with the federal government RINs to satisfy their individual obligations. However, pending litigation and soon-to-begin EPA rule making activities concerning the RFS standard could potentially open the door to a change in the point of obligation. If the point of obligation were to be shifted from refiners to blenders, Murphy USA would potentially have to utilize the RINs that it obtains through its blending activities to satisfy a new obligation and would therefore be unable to sell those RINs to third parties. This could have an impact on the Company's current business model, unless it were able to pass along these costs to consumers or other parties.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with the interruption of supply and increased costs as a result of our reliance on third-party supply and transportation of refined products.\nWe utilize key product supply and wholesale assets, including our pipeline positions and product distribution terminals, to supply our retail fueling stores. Much of our competitive advantage arises out of these proprietary arrangements which, if disrupted, could materially and adversely affect us. The novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic impacted 2021 and continues to cause disruptions in supply chains into 2022. In addition to our own operational risks discussed above, we could experience interruptions of supply or increases in costs to deliver refined products to market if the ability of the pipelines or vessels to transport petroleum or refined products is\ndisrupted because of weather events, accidents, governmental regulations or third-party actions. Furthermore, at some of our locations there are very few suppliers for fuel in that market.\nChanges in credit card expenses could reduce our profitability, especially on gasoline.\nA significant portion of our retail sales involve payment using credit cards. We are assessed credit card fees as a percentage of transaction amounts and not as a fixed dollar amount or percentage of our gross margins. Higher gasoline prices result in higher credit card expenses, and an increase in credit card use or an increase in credit card fees would have a similar effect. Therefore, credit card fees charged on gasoline purchases that are more expensive as a result of higher gasoline prices are not necessarily accompanied by higher gross margins. In fact, such fees may cause lower profitability. Lower income on gasoline sales caused by higher credit card fees may decrease our overall profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFailure to maintain the quality and safety of our food products could adversely impact our reputation and business.\nAs we continue to focus on enhancing our food and beverage offerings, concerns regarding the quality or safety of our food products or our food supply chain, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents, could hurt our sales of prepared food products and possibly lead to product liability and personal injury claims, litigation, government agency investigations and damages.\nWalmart retains certain rights in its agreements with us, which may adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nOur owned properties that were purchased from Walmart are subject to Easements with Covenants and Restrictions Affecting Land (the \u201cECRs\u201d) between us and Walmart. The ECRs impose customary restrictions on the use of our properties, which Walmart has the right to enforce. The ECRs also provide that if we propose to sell a fueling store property or any portion thereof (other than in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of our properties that were purchased from Walmart or in connection with a bona fide financing), Walmart has a right of first refusal to purchase such property or portion thereof on similar terms. Subject to certain exceptions (including a merger in which we participate, the transfer of any of our securities or a change in control of us), if we market for sale to a third party all or substantially all of our properties that were purchased from Walmart, or if we receive an unsolicited offer to purchase such properties that we intend to accept, we are required to notify Walmart. Walmart then has the right, within 90 days of receipt of such notice, to make an offer to purchase such properties. If Walmart makes such an offer, for a period of one year we will generally only be permitted to accept third-party offers where the net consideration to us would be greater than that offered by Walmart.\nThe ECRs also prohibit us from transferring all or substantially all of our fueling store properties that were purchased from Walmart to a \u201ccompetitor\u201d of Walmart, as reasonably determined by Walmart. The term \u201ccompetitor\u201d is generally defined in the ECRs as an entity that owns, operates or controls grocery stores or supermarkets, wholesale club operations similar to that of a Sam\u2019s Club, discount department stores or other discount retailers similar to any of the various Walmart store prototypes or pharmacy or drug stores.\nSimilarly, some of our leased properties are subject to certain rights retained by Walmart. Our master lease agreement states that if Murphy Oil USA, Inc. is acquired or becomes party to any merger or consolidation that results in a material change in the management of the stores, Walmart will have the option to purchase the stores at fair market value. The master lease also prohibits us from selling all or any portion of a store without first offering to sell all or such portion to Walmart on the same terms and conditions. These provisions may restrict our ability to conduct our business on the terms and in the manner we consider most favorable and may adversely affect our future growth.\nAn inability to maintain a multi-year new store project pipeline may cause our Company's growth to slow in 2022 and beyond.\nOur ability to grow by up to 45 new stores and up to 35 raze-and-rebuild stores in 2022 and by up to 55 NTI stores and 25 raze-and-rebuild stores in future years relies on the continued growth of our project pipeline and the building material supply chain. We have a very active Asset Development group that works to focus on our key target areas to locate suitable traffic count locations for this future growth. If the Asset Development group is unable to locate suitable locations or is unable to close the purchase for those locations in a timely fashion, the Company\ncould find that it does not have sufficient land to fulfill its pipeline. Further, permitting delays due to local government agency ability to timely respond to our requests could also negatively impact our pipeline.\nWe currently have one primary supplier for over 70% of our merchandise. A disruption in supply could have a material effect on our business.\nIn 2021, over 70% of our merchandise, including most tobacco products and grocery items, was purchased from a single wholesale grocer, Core-Mark. In January 2021, we renewed and extended for another five years a supply contract with Core-Mark. If Core-Mark is unable to fulfill its obligations under our contract, alternative suppliers that we could use in the event of a disruption may not be immediately available or offer merchandise on similar commercial terms. A disruption in supply could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCapital financing may not always be available to fund our activities.\nWe usually must spend and risk a significant amount of capital to fund our activities. Although most capital needs are funded from operating cash flow, the timing of cash flows from operations and capital funding needs may not always coincide, and the levels of cash flow may not fully cover capital funding requirements.\nFrom time to time, we may need to supplement our cash generated from operations with proceeds from financing activities. We have entered into a credit facility to provide us with available financing for working capital and other general corporate purposes. This credit facility is intended to meet any ongoing cash needs in excess of internally generated cash flows. Uncertainty and volatility in financial markets may materially impact the ability of the participating financial institutions to fund their commitments to us under our credit facility. Accordingly, we may not be able to obtain the full amount of the funds available under our credit facility to satisfy our cash requirements, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.\nWe could be adversely affected if we are not able to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nWe are dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel. If, for any reason, we are not able to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to the QuickChek Acquisition\nThe anticipated benefits of the QuickChek acquisition may not be realized or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\nThe success of the QuickChek acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings derived from the transaction and our ability to integrate the two organizations and businesses. The combination of two independent businesses is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process. As a result, we have devoted significant management attention and resources to integrate the business practices and operations of both organizations. The integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively, would impair the realization of the full expected benefits.\nWe may not be able to maintain the growth rate, levels of revenue, earnings, or operating efficiency that we and QuickChek have achieved or might achieve separately. In addition, we continue to evaluate our estimates of synergies to be realized from the QuickChek acquisition, so our actual cost-savings could differ materially from our current estimates. We cannot give assurance that we will achieve the full amount of cost-savings on the schedule anticipated or at all.\nMany factors affecting our ability to realize anticipated benefits are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and diversion of management's time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, even if our operations are integrated successfully with QuickChek, the full benefits of the transaction may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings, or sales or growth opportunities as originally anticipated. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our business with QuickChek. An inability to realize the full extent of, or any of, the anticipated benefits of the QuickChek acquisition, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAll of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share, decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the transactions, and negatively impact the price of our common stock.\nWe may need to recognize impairment charges related to goodwill, identified intangible assets and fixed assets.\nWe have balances of goodwill and intangible assets as a result of the QuickChek acquisition. We are required to test goodwill and any other intangible assets with an indefinite life for possible impairment on the same date each year and on an interim basis if there are indicators of a possible impairment. We are also required to evaluate amortizable intangible assets and fixed assets for impairment if there are indicators of a possible impairment.\nThere is significant judgement required in the analysis of a potential impairment of goodwill, identified intangible assets and fixed assets. If, as a result of a general economic slowdown, deterioration in one or more of the markets in which we operate or impairment in our financial performance and/or future outlook, the estimated fair value of our long-lived assets decreases, we may determine that one or more of our long-lived assets is impaired. An impairment charge would be determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets and any such impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant integration costs in connection with the QuickChek acquisition.\nIn connection with the QuickChek acquisition, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs and expenses, including financial advisory, legal, accounting, consulting and other advisory fees and expenses, reorganization and restructuring costs, employee benefit-related expenses, printing expenses and other related charges. While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred in connection with the QuickChek acquisition, there are many factors that could affect the total amount or timing of the integration and implementation expenses. There may also be additional unanticipated significant costs in connection with the QuickChek acquisition that we do not anticipate and may not be able to recoup. These costs and expenses could adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which such expenses are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related costs are actually paid, and could reduce the benefits and income we expect to achieve from the QuickChek acquisition.\nRisks Relating to Our Industry\nPandemics or disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, may disrupt consumption and trade patterns, supply chains and normal business activities, which could materially affect our operations and results of operations.\nPandemics or disease outbreaks such as COVID-19 may continue to cause depressed demand for our fuel and convenience merchandise products because quarantines may inhibit the ability or need for our customers to shop with us. We also may experience disruptions of logistics necessary to obtain and deliver products to our stores and our customers as we rely on third-parties to perform these vital functions to our business.\nIn addition, we could again experience issues with our workforce that limit our ability to continue to operate our stores at their normal hours of operations or experience government intervention that requires us to reduce hours or close certain locations. If a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work, including because of illness or travel or government restrictions in connection with pandemics or disease outbreaks, our operations may be negatively impacted. In addition, pandemics or disease outbreaks could result in an economic downturn that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect customers' demand for our products and services. We have had to reduce hours of operation in some stores temporarily, but this has not had a material impact on our financial results.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, which could adversely affect us in many ways, including our profitability, our ability to grow, and our ability to manage our businesses.\nWe operate in the oil and gas industry and experience intense competition from other independent retail and wholesale gasoline marketing companies. The U.S. marketing petroleum business is highly competitive, particularly with regard to accessing and marketing petroleum and other refined products. We compete with other chains of retail fuel stores for fuel supply and in the retail sale of refined products to end consumers, primarily on the\nbasis of price, but also on the basis of convenience and consumer appeal. In addition, we may also face competition from other retail fueling stores that adopt marketing strategies similar to ours by associating with non-traditional retailers, such as supermarkets, discount club stores and hypermarkets, particularly in the geographic areas in which we operate. We expect that our industry will continue to trend toward this model, resulting in increased competition to us over time. Moreover, because we do not produce or refine any of the petroleum or other refined products that we market, we compete with retail gasoline companies that have ongoing supply relationships with affiliates or former affiliates that manufacture refined products. We also compete with integrated companies that have their own production and/or refining operations that are at times able to offset losses from marketing operations with profits from producing or refining operations, and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed retail margins or supply shortages. In addition, we compete with other retail and wholesale gasoline marketing companies that have more extensive retail outlets and greater brand name recognition. Some of our competitors have been in existence longer than we have and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. As a result, these competitors may have a greater ability to bear the economic risks inherent in all phases of our business and may be able to respond better to changes in the economy and new opportunities within the industry. Such competition could adversely affect us, including our profitability, our ability to grow and our ability to manage our business.\nIn addition, the retail gasoline industry in the United States is highly competitive due to ease of entry and constant change in the number and type of retailers offering similar products and services. With respect to merchandise, our retail stores compete with other convenience store chains, independently owned convenience stores, supermarkets, drugstores, discount clubs, gasoline service stores, mass merchants, fast food operations and other similar retail outlets. Non-traditional retailers, including supermarkets, discount club stores and mass merchants, now compete directly with retail gasoline stores. These non-traditional gasoline retailers have obtained a significant share of the gasoline market, and their market share is expected to grow, and these retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts, both at the fuel pump and in the convenience store, to encourage in-store merchandise sales and gasoline sales. In addition, some large retailers and supermarkets are adjusting their store layouts and product prices in an attempt to appeal to convenience store customers. Major competitive factors include: location, ease of access, product and service selection, gasoline brands, pricing, customer service, store appearance, cleanliness and safety. Competition from these retailers may reduce our market share and our revenues, and the resulting impact on our business and results of operations could be materially adverse.\nFuture tobacco legislation, potential court rulings affecting the tobacco industry, campaigns to discourage smoking, increases in tobacco taxes and wholesale cost increases of tobacco products could have a material adverse impact on our retail operating revenues and gross margin.\nSales of tobacco products have historically accounted for an important portion of our total sales of convenience store merchandise. Significant increases in wholesale cigarette costs and tax increases on tobacco products, as well as future legislation, potential rulings in court cases impacting the tobacco industry, and national and local campaigns to discourage smoking in the United States, may have an adverse effect on the demand for tobacco products, and therefore reduce our revenues and profits. Also, increasing regulations, including those for e-cigarettes and vapor products could offset some of the recent gains we have experienced from selling these products. Governing bodies continue to consider banning flavored tobacco products. If such efforts are successful, it could have a further negative impact on our tobacco sales. These factors could materially and adversely affect our retail price of cigarettes, tobacco unit volume and sales, merchandise gross margin and overall customer traffic. Reduced sales of tobacco products or smaller gross margins on the sales we make could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCurrently, major cigarette manufacturers offer substantial rebates to retailers. We include these rebates as a component of our gross margin. In the event these rebates are no longer offered, or decreased, our profit from cigarette sales will decrease accordingly. In addition, reduced retail display allowances on cigarettes offered by cigarette manufacturers would negatively affect gross margins. These factors could materially affect our retail price of cigarettes, cigarette unit volume and revenues, merchandise gross margin and overall customer traffic, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in consumer behavior and travel as a result of changing economic conditions, the development of alternative energy technologies or otherwise could affect our business.\nIn the retail gasoline industry, customer traffic is generally driven by consumer preferences and spending trends, growth rates for commercial truck traffic and trends in travel and weather. Changes in economic conditions\ngenerally, or in the regions in which we operate, could adversely affect consumer spending patterns and travel in our markets. In particular, weakening economic conditions may result in decreases in miles driven and discretionary consumer spending and travel, which affect spending on gasoline and convenience items. In addition, changes in the types of products and services demanded by consumers may adversely affect our merchandise sales and gross margin. Additionally, negative publicity or perception surrounding gasoline suppliers could adversely affect their reputation and brand image, which may negatively affect our gasoline sales and gross margin. Our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer demands and preferences while continuing to sell products and services that remain relevant to the consumer and thus will positively impact overall retail gross margin.\nSimilarly, advanced technology, improved fuel efficiency and increased use of \u201cgreen\u201d automobiles (e.g., those automobiles that do not use gasoline or that are powered by hybrid engines) would reduce demand for gasoline and could fundamentally change our customers' shopping habits or lead to new forms of fueling destinations or new competitive pressures. Developments regarding climate change and the effects of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change and the environment have led to increased use of \u201cgreen\u201d automobiles. In addition, in August 2021, the Biden Administration issued an executive order which set a target to make half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 zero emission vehicles. Other market and social initiatives such as public and private initiatives that aim to subsidize the development of non-fossil fuel energy sources may also reduce the competitiveness of gasoline. Consequently, the increased adoption of \"green\" automobiles and general attitudes toward gasoline and its relationship to the environment may significantly affect our sales and ability to market our products. Reduced consumer demand for gasoline could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations and earnings have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide political developments.\nMany governments, including those that are members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d), unilaterally intervene at times in the orderly market of petroleum and natural gas produced in their countries through such actions as setting prices, determining rates of production, and controlling who may buy and sell the production. In addition, prices and availability of petroleum, natural gas and refined products could be influenced by political unrest and by various governmental policies to restrict or increase petroleum usage and supply. Other governmental actions that could affect our operations and earnings include tax changes, royalty increases and regulations concerning: currency fluctuations, protection and remediation of the environment, concerns over the possibility of global warming being affected by human activity including the production and use of hydrocarbon energy, restraints and controls on imports and exports, safety, and relationships between employers and employees. As a retail gasoline marketing company, we are significantly affected by these factors. Because these and other factors are subject to changes caused by governmental and political considerations and are often made in response to changing internal and worldwide economic conditions and to actions of other governments or specific events, it is not practical to attempt to predict the effects of such factors on our future operations and earnings.\nOur business is subject to operational hazards and risks normally associated with the marketing of petroleum products.\nWe operate in many different locations around the United States. The occurrence of an event, including but not limited to acts of nature such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and other forms of severe weather, and mechanical equipment failures, industrial accidents, fires, explosions, acts of war and intentional terrorist attacks could result in damage to our facilities, and the resulting interruption and loss of associated revenues; environmental pollution or contamination; and personal injury, including death, for which we could be deemed to be liable, and which could subject us to substantial fines and/or claims for punitive damages.\nWe store gasoline in storage tanks at our retail stores. Our operations are subject to significant hazards and risks inherent in storing gasoline. These hazards and risks include, but are not limited to, fires, explosions, spills, discharges and other releases, any of which could result in distribution difficulties and disruptions, environmental pollution, fines imposed by governmental agencies or cleanup obligations, personal injury or wrongful death claims and other damage to our properties and the properties of others. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain of our assets such as gasoline terminals and certain retail fueling stores lie near the U.S. coastline and are vulnerable to hurricane and tropical storm damages, which may result in shutdowns. The U.S. hurricane\nseason runs from June through November, but the most severe storm activities usually occur in late summer. Moreover, it should be noted that scientists have predicted that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events. If such effects were to occur, our operations could be adversely affected. Although we maintain insurance for certain of these risks as described below, due to policy deductibles and possible coverage limits, weather-related risks are not fully insured.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements, which could expose us to significant expenditures, liabilities or obligations and reduce product demand.\nWe are subject to stringent federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use and transportation of petroleum products and hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of such substances into the environment; the content and characteristics of fuel products; the process safety of our facilities; and human health and safety. Pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations, we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. While we strive to abide by these requirements, we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. If we violate or fail to comply with these requirements, we could be subject to litigation, costs, fines or other sanctions. Environmental requirements, and the enforcement and interpretation thereof, change frequently and have generally become more stringent over time. Compliance with existing and future environmental laws, regulations and permits may require significant expenditures. In addition, to the extent fuel content and characteristic standards increase our wholesale purchase costs, we may be adversely affected if we are unable to recover such costs in our pricing.\nWe could be subject to joint and several as well as strict liability for environmental contamination, without regard to fault or the legality of our conduct. In particular, we could be liable for contamination relating to properties that we own, lease or operate or that we or our predecessors previously owned, leased or operated. Substantially all of these properties have or in the past had storage tanks to store motor fuel or petroleum products. Leaks from such tanks may impact soil or groundwater and could result in substantial costs. We could also be held responsible for contamination relating to third-party sites to which we or our predecessors have sent regulated materials. In addition to potentially significant investigation and remediation costs, any such contamination, leaks from storage tanks or other releases of regulated materials can give rise to claims from governmental authorities and other third parties for fines or penalties, natural resource damages, personal injury and property damage.\nOur business is also affected by fuel economy standards and GHG vehicle emission reduction measures. As such fuel economy and GHG reduction requirements become more stringent over time, demand for our products may be adversely affected. In addition, some of our facilities are subject to GHG regulation. We are currently required to report annual GHG emissions from certain of our operations, and additional GHG emission-related requirements that may affect our business have been finalized or are in various phases of discussion or implementation. Any existing or future GHG emission requirements could result in increased operating costs and additional compliance expenses.\nOur expenditures, liabilities and obligations relating to environmental matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, product demand, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur retail operations are subject to extensive government laws and regulations, and the cost of compliance with such laws and regulations can be material.\nOur retail operations are subject to extensive local, state and federal governmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things, the sale of alcohol, tobacco, lottery and lotto, employment conditions, including minimum wage requirements, and public accessibility requirements. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, failure to comply with local, state and federal laws and regulations to which our operations are subject may result in penalties and costs that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn certain areas where our retail stores are located, state or local laws limit the retail stores\u2019 hours of operation or sale of alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, possible inhalants and lottery tickets, in particular to minors. Failure to comply with these laws could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations because these state and local regulatory agencies have the power to revoke, suspend or deny applications for and renewals of permits and licenses relating to the sale of these products or to seek other remedies, such as the imposition of fines or other penalties.\nRegulations related to wages also affect our business. Any appreciable increase in the statutory minimum wage or changes in overtime rules would result in an increase in our labor costs and such cost increase, or the penalties for failing to comply with such statutory minimums, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAny changes in the laws or regulations described above that are adverse to us and our properties could affect our operating and financial performance. In addition, new regulations are proposed from time to time which, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFuture consumer or other litigation could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur retail operations are characterized by a high volume of customer traffic and by transactions involving a wide array of product selections. These operations carry a higher exposure to consumer litigation risk when compared to the operations of companies operating in many other industries. Consequently, we have been, and may in the future be from time to time, involved in lawsuits seeking cash settlements for alleged personal injuries, property damages and other business-related matters, as well as energy content, off-specification gasoline, products liability and other legal actions in the ordinary course of our business. While these actions are generally routine in nature and incidental to the operation of our business, if our assessment of any action or actions should prove inaccurate, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. For more information about our legal matters, see Note 19 \u201cContingencies\u201d to the consolidated historical financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2021 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Further, adverse publicity about consumer or other litigation may negatively affect us, regardless of whether the allegations are true, by discouraging customers from purchasing gasoline or merchandise at our retail stores.\nWe rely on our technology systems and network infrastructure to manage numerous aspects of our business, and a disruption of these systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on our technology systems and network infrastructure to manage numerous aspects of our business and provide analytical information to management. These systems are an essential component of our business and growth strategies, and a serious disruption to them could significantly limit our ability to manage and operate our business efficiently. These systems are vulnerable to, among other things, damage and interruption from power loss or natural disasters, computer system and network failures, loss of telecommunications services, physical and electronic loss of data, security breaches and computer viruses, which could result in a loss of sensitive personal data, including credit and debit card information from our customers, sensitive business information, systems interruption or the disruption of our business operations. To protect against unauthorized access or attacks, we have implemented infrastructure protection technologies such as theft and disaster recovery plans, but there can be no assurance that a technology systems breach or systems failure, which may occur and go undetected, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business and our reputation could be adversely affected by the failure to protect sensitive customer, employee or vendor data or to comply with applicable regulations relating to data security and privacy.\nIn the normal course of our business as a gasoline and merchandise retailer, we obtain large amounts of personal data, including credit and debit card information from our customers. We also engage third-party vendors that provide technology, systems, and services to facilitate our collection, retention, processing and transmission of this information. While we have invested significant amounts in the protection of our technology systems and maintain what we believe are adequate security controls over individually identifiable customer, employee and vendor data provided to us, a breakdown or a breach in our systems that results in the unauthorized release of individually identifiable customer or other sensitive data could nonetheless occur and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, operating results and financial condition. Such a breakdown or breach could also materially increase the costs we incur to protect against such risks. Also, a material failure on our part, or the part of our vendors, to comply with regulations relating to our obligation to protect such sensitive data or the privacy rights of our customers, employees and others could subject us to fines or other regulatory sanctions and potentially to lawsuits and adversely affect our brand name.\nCompliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance.\nWe are subject to extensive tax liabilities imposed by multiple jurisdictions, including income taxes, indirect taxes (excise/duty, sales/use and gross receipts taxes), payroll taxes, franchise taxes, withholding taxes and ad valorem taxes. Tax laws and regulations are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of existing laws are issued and applied. This activity could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Many of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may subject us to interest and penalties.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and if securities or industry analysts publish unfavorable research reports about our business or if they downgrade their rating on our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe price at which our common stock trades may fluctuate significantly. The trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022fluctuations in quarterly or annual results of operations, especially if they differ from our previously announced guidance or forecasts made by analysts;\n\u2022announcements by us of anticipated future revenues or operating results, or by others concerning us, our competitors, our customers, or our industry;\n\u2022our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u2022competitive environment;\n\u2022regulatory developments; and\n\u2022changes in overall stock market conditions, including the stock prices of our competitors.\nProvisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and certain provisions of Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of us.\nThe existence of some provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of us that a stockholder may consider favorable. These include provisions:\n\u2022providing for a classified board of directors;\n\u2022providing that our directors may be removed by our stockholders only for cause;\n\u2022establishing super majority vote requirements for our shareholders to amend certain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws;\n\u2022authorizing a large number of shares of stock that are not yet issued, which would allow our board of directors to issue shares to persons friendly to current management, thereby protecting the continuity of our management, or which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of persons seeking to obtain control of us;\n\u2022prohibiting stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders or taking action by written consent; and\n\u2022establishing advance notice requirements for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at the annual stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors, including discouraging takeover attempts that could have resulted in a premium over the market price for shares of our common stock.\nThese provisions apply even if a takeover offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our and our stockholders\u2019 best interests.\nWe may issue preferred stock with terms that could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other rights, and such qualifications, limitations or restrictions as our board of directors generally may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or dividend, distribution or liquidation preferences we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nOur Bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a preferred judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur Bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of Delaware General Corporation Law, our Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations for any class or series of our preferred stock) or our Bylaws, in each case, as amended from time to time, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware, in all cases subject to the court\u2019s having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provision. This forum selection provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable or cost-effective for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees.\nWe may not achieve the intended benefits of having an exclusive forum provision if it is found to be unenforceable.\nWe have included an exclusive forum provision in our Bylaws as described above. However, the enforceability of similar exclusive jurisdiction provisions in other companies\u2019 bylaws or certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that, in connection with any action, a court could find the exclusive jurisdiction provision contained in our Bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action. Although in June 2013 the Delaware Court of Chancery upheld the statutory and contractual validity of exclusive forum-selection bylaw provisions, and in 2015 the Delaware General Corporation Law was amended to permit forum-selection provisions applicable to \"integral corporate claims\", the validity of forum-selection provisions continues to be tested with litigation. Furthermore, the Delaware Court of Chancery emphasized that such provisions may not be enforceable under circumstances where they are found to operate in an unreasonable or unlawful manner or in a manner inconsistent with a board\u2019s fiduciary duties. Also, it is uncertain whether non-Delaware courts consistently will enforce such exclusive forum-selection bylaw provisions. If a court were to find our choice of forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions and we may not obtain the benefits of limiting jurisdiction to the courts selected.", "PERMNO": 14076, "SIC": 5500, "TIC": "MUSA"}
