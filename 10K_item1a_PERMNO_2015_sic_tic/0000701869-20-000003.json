{"cik": "701869", "company": "INDEPENDENCE HOLDING CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nInvestors should carefully consider the risks set forth below and all other information contained in this report and other documents we file with the SEC. Many of the factors that affect our business and operations involve risk and uncertainty. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that we face, but are those that we have identified as being the most significant factors. Our business is also subject to general risk and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not know about, or that we deem less significant than those identified below, may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks related to our Business\nOur investment portfolio is subject to various risks that may result in realized investment losses. In particular, decreases in the fair value of fixed maturities may greatly reduce the value of our investments, and as a result, our financial condition may suffer.\nWe are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio. Defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations under these securities could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or result in the continued recognition of investment losses. The value of our investments may be materially adversely affected by increases in interest rates, downgrades in the preferred stocks and bonds included in our portfolio and by other factors that may result in the continued recognition of other-than-temporary impairments. Each of these events may cause us to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio.\nIn particular, at December 31, 2019, fixed maturities represented $385.0 million or 75.3% of our total investments of $511.1 million. The fair value of fixed maturities and the related investment income fluctuates depending on general economic and market conditions. The fair value of these investments generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us will generally increase or decrease in line with changes in market interest rates. In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations. An investment has prepayment risk when there is a risk that the timing of cash flows that result from the repayment of principal might occur earlier than anticipated because of declining interest rates or later than anticipated because of rising interest rates. The impact of value fluctuations affects our Consolidated Financial Statements. Because all of our fixed maturities are classified as available for sale, changes in the fair value of our securities are reflected in our stockholders' equity (accumulated other comprehensive income or loss). No similar adjustment is made for liabilities to reflect a change in interest rates. Therefore, interest rate fluctuations and economic conditions could adversely affect our stockholders' equity, total comprehensive income (loss) and/or cash flows. For mortgage-backed securities, credit risk exists if mortgagees default on the underlying mortgages. Although, at December 31, 2019, all of the Company\u2019s fixed maturities were investment grade and continue to be rated on average AA, all of the fixed maturities are subject to credit risk. If any of the issuers of our fixed maturities suffer financial setbacks, the ratings on the fixed maturities could fall (with a concurrent fall in fair value) and, in a worst-case scenario, the issuer could default on its financial obligations. If the issuer defaults, we could have realized losses associated with the impairment of the securities.\nWe regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that are other-than-temporarily impaired are identified in a timely fashion, properly valued and any impairment is charged against earnings in the proper period. Assessment factors include, but are not limited to, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and rating of the issuer, whether any collateral is held and the Company's intent to sell, or be required to sell, debt securities\nbefore the anticipated recovery of its remaining amortized cost basis. However, the determination that a security has incurred an other-than-temporary decline in value requires the judgment of management. Inherently, there are risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments. Therefore, changes in facts and circumstances and critical assumptions could result in management\u2019s decision that further impairments have occurred. This could lead to additional losses on investments, particularly those that management has the intent and ability to hold until recovery in value occurs.\nOur earnings could be materially affected by an impairment of goodwill.\nGoodwill represented $60.2 million of our $1.1 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2019. We review our goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We regularly assess whether any indicators of impairment exist, which requires a significant amount of judgment. Such indicators may include: a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization; a decline in our expected future cash flows; a significant adverse change in the business climate; and/or slower growth rates, among others. Any adverse change in one of these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. If we experience a sustained decline in our results of operations and cash flows, or other indicators of impairment exist, we may incur a material non-cash charge to earnings relating to impairment of our goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on our results.\nOur loss reserves are based on an estimate of our future liability, and if actual claims prove to be greater than our reserves, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe maintain loss reserves to cover our estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, where material, including legal and other fees, and costs not associated with specific claims but related to the claims payment functions for reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period. Because setting reserves is inherently uncertain, we cannot be sure that current reserves will prove adequate. If our reserves are insufficient to cover our actual losses and loss adjustment expenses, we would have to augment our reserves and incur a charge to our earnings, and these charges could be material. Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost. These estimates, which generally involve actuarial projections, are based on our assessment of known facts and circumstances. Many factors could affect these reserves, including economic and social conditions, frequency and severity of claims, medical trends resulting from the influences of underlying cost inflation, changes in utilization and demand for medical services, and changes in doctrines of legal liability and damage awards in litigation. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable in advance. Additionally, there may be a significant reporting lag between the occurrence of the insured event and the time it is reported to us. The inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities, particularly those in which the various considerations affecting the type of claim are subject to change and in which long periods of time may elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made. Reserve estimates are continually refined in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops and further claims are reported and settled and are reflected in the results of the periods in which such estimates are changed.\nOur inability to assess underwriting risk accurately could reduce our net income.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to assess accurately the risks associated with the businesses on which we retain risk. If we fail to assess accurately the risks we retain, we may fail to establish the appropriate premium rates and our reserves may be inadequate to cover our losses, requiring augmentation of the reserves, which in turn would reduce our net income.\nOur agreements with our producers that underwrite on our behalf require that each such producer follow underwriting guidelines published by us and amended from time to time. Failure to follow these guidelines may result in termination or modification of the agreement. We perform periodic audits to confirm adherence to the guidelines, but it is possible that we would not detect a breach in the guidelines\nfor some time after the infraction, which could result in a material impact on the Net Loss Ratio (defined as insurance benefits, claims and reserves divided by the difference between premiums earned and underwriting expenses) for that producer and could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nThe results of operations of our insurance business will decline if our premium rates are not adequate or if we are unable to increase rates.\nWe set the premium rates on our health insurance policies based on facts and circumstances known at the time we issue the policies and on assumptions about numerous variables, including the actuarial probability of a policyholder incurring a claim, the probable size of the claim, maintenance costs to administer the policies and the interest rate earned on our investment of premiums. In setting premium rates, we consider historical claims information, industry statistics, the rates of our competitors and other factors, but we cannot predict with certainty the future actual claims on our products. If our actual claims experience proves to be less favorable than we assumed and we are unable to raise our premium rates to the extent necessary to offset the unfavorable claims experience, our financial results will be adversely affected.\nRetentions in various lines of business expose us to potential losses.\nWe retain most of the risk for our own account on some business underwritten by our insurance companies. The determination to not purchase reinsurance, or to reduce the amount of reinsurance we purchase, for a particular risk or line of business is based on a variety of factors including market conditions, pricing, availability of reinsurance, the level of our capital and our loss history. Such determinations have the effect of increasing our financial exposure to losses associated with such risks or in such lines of business and, in the event of significant losses associated with such risks or lines of business, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf rating agencies downgrade our insurance companies, our results of operations and competitive position in the industry may suffer.\nRatings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and are important to maintaining public confidence in our company and our products, and our ability to market our products. Standard Security Life, Madison National Life and Independence American are all rated \u201cA-\u201d (Excellent) by A.M. Best Company, Inc. A.M. Best's ratings reflect its opinions of an insurance company's financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and are not evaluations directed to investors. The ratings of our carriers are subject to periodic review by A.M. Best, and we cannot assure the continued maintenance of our current ratings. Because these ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies, a downgrade in our financial strength ratings, or the announced potential for a downgrade, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in several ways, including: (i) materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders and withdrawals by contract holders and policyholders, as policyholders might move to other companies with higher claims-paying and financial strength ratings; (ii) reducing new sales of insurance products; (iii) increasing our cost of capital; (iv) adversely affecting our relationships with distribution partners; (v) requiring us to reduce prices or increase crediting rates for many of our products and services to remain competitive; and (vi) adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance or obtain reasonable pricing on reinsurance.\nChanges in accounting and reporting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies and insurance regulators could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), which is periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time, we\nare required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board. It is possible that future accounting and reporting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the required adoption of future accounting and reporting standards may result in significant costs to implement. For example, current proposals may change the accounting for insurance contracts and financial instruments and could result in increased volatility of net income as well as other comprehensive income. In addition, these proposals could require us to make significant changes to systems and use additional resources, resulting in significant incremental costs to implement the proposals.\nThe Trump Administration made substantial changes to fiscal and tax policies that may adversely affect our business.\nThe Trump Administration called for substantial changes to fiscal and tax policies, which included comprehensive tax reform. On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). The Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to reducing the Federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), eliminating corporate alternative minimum tax provisions, limiting the utilization of net operating losses arising after December 31, 2017 to 80% of taxable income with no carryback but with an indefinite carryforward, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), adding limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation, allowing the expensing of capital expenditures, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate as well as other significant changes to the U.S. tax code, the overall impact of the Tax Act is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, the impact of current and future fiscal policy changes are unknown and could affect our business and financial condition. We continue to evaluate the impact of the Tax Act as regulations and accounting standards related to the Tax Act are finalized to determine whether changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. Although we believe that our tax positions are sound and consistent with applicable laws, regulations and existing precedent, there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.\nThe impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse. We urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to this legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding our common stock.\nIncreases in insurance claim costs will negatively impact the revenues and profitability of our insurance business.\nThe major component of insurance cost represents the cost of claims, which are not within our control. While we seek to limit our exposure on any single insured, significant unfavorable claims experience will reduce our revenues and profitability. Increases in insurance claim costs will negatively impact the revenues and profitability of our insurance business.\nLegal and regulatory investigations and actions are increasingly common in the insurance business and may result in financial losses and harm our reputation.\nWe face a risk of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our business, including the risk of class actions, regulatory actions and individual lawsuits\nrelating, among other things, to sales or underwriting practices, payment of contingent or other sales commissions, claims payments and procedures, marketing, product design, disclosure, administration, additional premium charges for premiums paid on a periodic basis, interest crediting practices, denial or delay of benefits and breaches of fiduciary or other duties to customers. Adverse judgments in one or more of such lawsuits could require us to pay significant damage amounts or to change aspects of our operations. Plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, which may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. Further, industry trends, such as increased litigation against the insurance industry and individual insurers, the willingness of courts to expand covered causes of loss and the size of awards, rising jury awards, escalating medical costs, and increasing loss severity may render the loss reserves of our insurance subsidiaries inadequate for current and future losses. The unpredictability of court decisions in the insurance business could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation and cash flows. In addition, the political divisiveness leading, in some cases, to the stalling of the legislative process, may cause judicial activism and result in rulings concerning our products, the way we sell our products, and the profitability of our products, which may result in greater differences in the regulatory approaches of the states.\nWe are also subject to various regulatory examinations, inquiries and proceedings, such as information requests, subpoenas, market conduct exams and books and record examinations, from state and federal regulators and other authorities in the ordinary course of our business. Our subsidiaries, Standard Security Life, Madison National Life and Independence American, have been selected for a multistate market conduct exam, related to our short term medical, limited medical and fixed indemnity health insurance products for the period of January 1, 2014 through September 30, 2017. We are fully cooperating with the participating states in this examination. Regulatory agencies and other authorities may find that our policies, procedures, practices or contracts are not compliant with or in violation of applicable regulations, which may result in fines or penalties, recommendations for corrective action or changes in business practices that require us to incur substantial costs, or other regulatory actions. Furthermore, increased regulatory scrutiny and any resulting investigations or proceedings could result in new legal actions or precedents and industry-wide regulations or practices that could adversely affect our business. Even if we ultimately prevail in the litigation, regulatory action or investigation, any such action or proceeding could significantly injure our reputation, cause negative publicity, adversely affect our financial strength ratings, place us at a competitive disadvantage in marketing or administering our products or impair our ability to sell or retain insurance policies, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur reliance upon third party administrators and other outsourcing arrangements may disrupt or adversely affect our operations.\nWe depend, and may in the future increase our dependence, on third parties for significant portions of our operations, including claims processing, premium billing, claims management, claims payment and voice communication services, and other systems-related support. This dependence makes our operations vulnerable to the third parties' failure to perform adequately under the contract due to internal or external factors. In the future, this dependence may increase as we may outsource additional areas of our business operations to additional vendors. There can be no assurance that any conversion or transition of business process functions from the Company to a vendor or between vendors will be seamless and these projects could result in significant operational challenges that cause financial difficulties. In addition, if our relationships with our outsourcing partners are significantly disrupted or terminated for any reason or if the financial terms of such outsourcing partners change materially, we may not be able to find an alternative partner in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms. As a result, we may not be able to meet the demands of our customers and, in turn, our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\nOur dependence on third parties makes our operations vulnerable to such parties\u2019 failure to perform as agreed. Incorrect information from these entities could cause us to incur additional expense to utilize additional resources to validate, reconcile and correct the information. Any failure to recommend payment on claims fairly could lead to material litigation, undermine our reputation in the marketplace, impair our\nimage and adversely affect our financial results. There can be no assurance that future third party data will not disrupt or adversely affect our results of operations. A change in service providers, or a move of services from a third party to internal operations, could result in significant operational challenges, a decline in service quality and effectiveness, increased cost or less favorable contract terms, which could adversely affect our operating results. Some of our outsourced services are being performed offshore. Prevailing economic conditions and other circumstances could prevent our offshore vendors' ability to adequately perform as agreed, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if our third party administrators, managing general agents, general agents or other producers exceed their authorities, otherwise breach obligations owed to us or commit fraud.\nIn connection with certain lines of business and insurance programs, we authorize third party administrators, managing general agents, general agents and other producers to write business and/or settle claims on our behalf within underwriting and claims settlement authorities prescribed by us. We have less control and supervision over these underwriters and claims staff than our own employees and rely on the controls of our agents to write business within the underwriting authorities and settle claims within guidelines provided by us. Although we monitor our business on an ongoing basis, our monitoring efforts may not be adequate and our agents may exceed their underwriting authorities or otherwise breach their obligations owed to us. To the extent that our agents exceed their authorities, otherwise breach their obligations owed to us or commit fraud, this may result in a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe utilize reinsurance arrangements to help manage our business risks, and failure to perform by the counterparties to our reinsurance arrangements may expose us to risks we had sought to mitigate.\nWe utilize reinsurance to mitigate our risks in various circumstances. Through reinsurance, we have the contractual right to collect the amount reinsured from our reinsurers. Although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer, reinsurance does not relieve us of our direct liability to our policyholders. Accordingly, we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers. We cannot assure that our reinsurers will pay all of our reinsurance claims, or that they will pay our claims on a timely basis. Additionally, catastrophic losses from multiple direct insurers may accumulate within the more concentrated reinsurance market and result in claims that adversely impact the financial condition of such reinsurers and thus their ability to pay such claims. Further, additional adverse developments in the capital markets could affect our reinsurers\u2019 ability to meet their obligations to us. If we become liable for risks we have ceded to reinsurers or if our reinsurers cease to meet their obligations to us because they are insolvent or in a weakened financial position as a result of incurred losses or otherwise, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur reliance on brokers, program administrators and third-party claims adjusters subjects us to risk.\nWe transact business through intermediaries, frequently paying insured claims through program administrators or third-party claims adjustment services, and these parties, in turn, pay these amounts to the clients that have purchased insurance from us. If such an intermediary were to fail to pass such a payment through to the claimant or policyholder, we may remain liable for the deficiency because of applicable local laws or contractual obligations. Likewise, when a customer pays its policy premium to a broker or program administrator for further remittance to us, that premium is generally considered to have been paid and the client is no longer liable for such amount even if we do not actually receive the premium. Consequently, we assume a degree of credit risk associated with the intermediaries we use with respect to our insurance and reinsurance business.\nThe success of our business strategy depends on the continuing service of key executives, the members of our senior management team and other highly-skilled personnel.\nWe rely on the continued service of key executives, members of our senior management team and highly skilled personnel throughout all levels of our business. Our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire qualified personnel. We believe that our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to recruit, hire, motivate, develop, and retain talented and highly skilled personnel who are knowledgeable about our business. Doing so may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in economic and industry conditions and the effectiveness of our compensation programs and competition. If we do not succeed in retaining and motivating our existing key employees and in attracting new key personnel, our revenue growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be unsuccessful in competing against larger or better-established business rivals.\nWe compete with a large number of other companies in our selected lines of business. We face competition from specialty insurance companies, and from diversified financial services companies and insurance companies that are much larger than we are and that have far greater financial, marketing and other resources. Some of these competitors also have greater experience and more market recognition than we do in certain lines of business. In addition to competition in the operation of our business, we face competition from a variety of sources in attracting and retaining qualified employees. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current competitive position in the markets in which we operate, or that we will be able to expand operations into new markets. If we fail to do so, our results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nAlso, insurance companies may seek to consolidate through mergers and acquisitions. Continued consolidation within the insurance industry will further enhance the already competitive underwriting environment as we would likely experience more robust competition from larger competitors. These consolidated entities may use their enhanced market power and broader capital base to take business from us or to drive down pricing, which could adversely affect the results of our operations.\nWe may be unsuccessful in our continued efforts to execute on our strategies to diversify sources of income.\nWe have devoted significant effort and financial resources to build new products, distribution and service capabilities to diversify our product portfolio. We aim to continue implementing our strategies while maintaining current positions of strength in our existing businesses, as well as maintaining the strength of our balance sheet. Our success will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to achieve customer name recognition, accurately predict market trends, differentiate our product offerings from our competitors\u2019 products, provide excellent customer service, attract and retain skilled employees, maintain comprehensive focus on all company priorities, develop new products in a timely manner and achieve market acceptance, effectively implement new technology and operational platforms, deepen our existing distribution relationships and add new distribution partners, and set appropriate prices for our products. We may incur higher-than-expected costs or fail to generate expected levels of revenue and profitability associated with this strategy. Further, if we fail to accomplish all or a combination of these strategies, our ability to profitably grow our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems and to safeguard the security of our data could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our computer systems, and we have different information systems for our various businesses. We rely on these systems to perform actuarial and other modeling functions necessary for writing business, to provide insurance quotes, to process our premiums and policies, to administer our products, to process and make\nclaims payments, to establish our loss reserves, and to prepare our management and external financial statements and information. The failure of these systems could interrupt our operation and we could experience adverse consequences, including: (i) inadequate information on which to base pricing, underwriting and reserving decisions; (ii) inadequate information for accurate financial reporting; (iii) increases in administrative expenses; (iv) the loss of existing customers or key distributors; (v) difficulty in attracting new customers or distributors; (vi) an inability to comply with regulations or customer or vendor expectations, such as failure to meet prompt payment obligations; (vii) customer, provider and agent disputes; and (viii) litigation or regulatory enforcement exposure. We have committed and will continue to commit significant resources to develop, maintain and enhance our existing information systems, transition existing systems to upgraded systems, and develop new information systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences.\nOur database and systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from system outages, disasters such as earthquakes, fires, floods, acts of terrorism, blackouts, power loss, telecommunications failures, and similar events, which would compromise our ability to conduct business. In the event of such failures, we may be unable to perform critical functions in a timely manner, and our systems may not be available to our employees, customers or business partners for an extended period of time. Any such interruptions may reduce our revenues or increase our expenses, and may also have an adverse impact upon our reputation, distribution partnerships, or our customer or vendor relationships. Such an occurrence may also impair our ability to timely and accurately complete our financial reporting and other regulatory obligations and may impact the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We also utilize and/or rely on computer systems developed and maintained by outsourcing relationships and key vendors. Their systems could experience the same risks, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business results.\nWe have committed and will continue to commit significant resources to develop, maintain and enhance our existing information systems, transition existing systems to upgraded systems, and develop new information systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences. Advances in technology that may render our current information technology systems obsolete will require upgrading and maintenance over time, which may require significant future commitments of resources and capital. If we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data or reduced functionality. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in, among other consequences, interruptions in our services, which could harm our reputation and financial results.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable privacy and security laws and respond to emerging security threats and potential security incidents, our business, reputation, results of operations, financial positions and cash flows could be materially affected.\nOur computer systems have been, and will continue to be, subject to computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access, acts of vandalism, theft, misuse, cyber-attacks, hackers, corruption and destruction of data maintained online or digitally, and other computer-related penetrations. For instance, cyber-attacks may interfere with our processing of transactions including: (i) the processing of orders from our website; (ii) cause the release and possible destruction of confidential customer or business information; (iii) impede application processing; (iv) subject us and/or our service providers and intermediaries to regulatory fines and financial losses; and/or (v) cause reputational damage. Such threats require additional layers of security, which may disrupt or impact efficiency of operations. We commit significant resources to administrative and technical controls to prevent cyber incidents and protect our information technology, but our preventative actions to reduce the risk of cyber threats may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, denial of service and other cyber-attacks or security breaches. Such an event could compromise our confidential information as well as that of our clients and third parties, with whom we interact, impede or interrupt business operations and may result in other negative consequences, including remediation costs, loss of revenue, disruption of our operations, additional\nregulatory scrutiny, sanctions (such as penalties, fines and loss of license) and litigation, and reputational damage.\nAdditionally, past or future negligence or misconduct by our employees or employees of our vendors or suppliers could result in misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, violations of laws by us, regulatory sanctions against us and/or serious reputational, legal or financial harm to our business, and the precautions we employ to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. Although we employ controls and procedures designed to monitor the business decisions and activities of these individuals to prevent us from engaging in inappropriate activities, excessive risk taking, fraud or security breaches, these individuals may take such risks regardless of such controls and procedures and such controls and procedures may fail to detect all such decisions and activities. We review our compensation policies and procedures as part of our overall risk management program, but it is possible that such compensation policies and practices could inadvertently incentivize excessive or inappropriate risk taking. If these individuals take excessive or inappropriate risks, those risks could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe failure to safeguard the security of our data and protect our customers\u2019 confidential information and privacy could adversely affect our business and expose us to substantial liability, reputational harm, loss of revenue and other damages.\nIn the conduct of our business, we are subject to privacy regulations and to confidentiality obligations. Our business depends on our clients\u2019 and customers\u2019 willingness to entrust us with their sensitive personal information. The collection, maintenance, protection, use, transmission, disclosure and disposal of sensitive personal information are regulated at the federal, state and industry levels and requirements are imposed on us by contracts with customers. For example, the collection and use of patient data in our health insurance operations is regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and certain other activities we conduct, are subject to the privacy regulations of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. HIPAA also requires business associates as well as covered entities to comply with certain privacy and security requirements. In addition, we also have contractual obligations to protect certain confidential information we obtain from our existing vendors, partners and policyholders. These obligations generally include protecting such confidential information in the same manner and to the same extent as we protect our own confidential information, and in some instances may impose indemnity obligations on us relating to unlawful or unauthorized disclosure of any such information.\nDespite the implementation of network security measures, our computer systems may be vulnerable to physical and electronic break-ins, computer viruses or malware, programming errors, attacks by third parties, unauthorized access, tampering, cyber-attacks, and other computer-related penetrations and similar disruptive problems. A breach of cybersecurity could compromise our confidential information, including personal identifiable information of our customers and employees, and information related to third parties with whom we interact. A person who is able to circumvent these security measures and penetrate our and our subsidiaries\u2019 computer systems could access, view, misappropriate, alter, or delete any information in the systems, including personally identifiable customer information and proprietary business information. There have been large scale cyber-attacks and other cyber-security breaches within the insurance industry. As we increase the amount of personal information that we store and share digitally, our exposure to data security and related cyber-security risks increases, including the risk of undetected attacks, damage, loss or unauthorized access or misappropriation of proprietary or personal information, and the cost of attempting to protect against these risks also increases. In addition, while we review and assess the cybersecurity controls of our third party providers to whom we outsource certain services, as appropriate, and make changes to our business processes to manage these risks, such third parties and, in turn, their own service providers, may become subject to the same type of security breaches. If we do not properly comply with privacy regulations and protect confidential information and there is inappropriate access, use, or disclosure of personally identifiable customer information, we could experience adverse consequences, including regulatory sanctions, such as civil and criminal liability, penalties, fines and loss of license, as well as possible litigation. In addition, an increasing number of states require that customers be notified of\nunauthorized access, use, or disclosure of their information. This could also have an adverse impact on our image or customer relationships and, therefore, result in loss of distribution partners, lower sales, lapses of existing business, or increased expenses. We purchase cyber risk insurance and assess the adequacy of this insurance annually, but this insurance may not be sufficient in scope or amount to cover all of our losses from breaches of our data.\nThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners (\u201cNAIC\u201d) has adopted an Insurance Data Security Model Law, which, if adopted by a state will require insurers, insurance producers and other entities required to be licensed under state insurance laws to comply with certain requirements under state insurance laws, such as developing and maintaining a written information security program, conducting risk assessments and overseeing the data security practices of third-party vendors. The purpose of the model law is to establish standards for data security and for the investigation and notification of insurance commissioners of cybersecurity events involving unauthorized access to, or the misuse of, certain nonpublic information. Certain states have adopted the model law, and we expect that additional states will begin adopting the model law, although it cannot be predicted whether or not, or in what form or when, they will do so. We are currently evaluating these regulations and their potential impact on our operations. In addition, certain state insurance regulators are developing or have developed regulations that may impose regulatory requirements relating to cybersecurity on insurance and reinsurance companies (potentially including insurance and reinsurance companies that are not domiciled, but are licensed, in the relevant state). For example, the New York State Department of Financial Services has adopted a regulation pertaining to cybersecurity for all banking, insurance entities and other financial services institutions under its jurisdiction, effective as of March 1, 2017, that requires them to establish and maintain a cybersecurity program \u201cdesigned to protect consumers and ensure the safety and soundness of New York State's financial services industry.\u201d We have established a cybersecurity program in place outlining our policies and procedures for the protection of our information systems and information stored on those systems that comports with the regulation and continue to evaluate this regulation and its potential impact on our operations, but depending on its implementation, we may be required to incur significant expense in order to meet its requirements. We expect cybersecurity risk management, prioritization and reporting to continue to be an area of significant focus by governments, regulatory bodies and self-regulatory organizations at all levels.\nWe have risks from exiting the individual life and annuities business.\nWe exited the individual life and annuities business in July 2015 when our subsidiaries, Madison National Life and Standard Security Life, closed on an agreement to coinsure substantially all of their run-off blocks of individual life and annuities and sold Madison National Life's infrastructure related to those blocks, to National Guardian Life Insurance Company (\u201cNGL\u201d). If NGL defaults on its reinsurance commitments and/or its administration commitments, then the policies may come back to us. Since we have sold our infrastructure, we would not have the ability to administer the business because we no longer have the IT systems or staff to support the business. We may have to incur expenses to rebuild our capabilities and for regulatory and other legal actions, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have risks from the Paid Family Leave Risk Adjustment Program\nBeginning January 1, 2018, a rider was added to all DBL policies adding benefits for PFL. This rider is mandated by the NYSDFS. The PFL premium rate charged is set by the NYSDFS. In addition to mandating this benefit, the NYSDFS established a risk adjustment program so that all carriers would share on a pro rata basis in the ultimate profit or loss of the PFL business across three group sizes for the entire industry. The goal of the PFL risk adjustment program is to protect issuers from disproportionate adverse or favorable risks that might arise because PFL premium rates are community rated and not allowed to vary by risk factors.\nSince the NYSDFS established a risk adjustment program, the Company is required to record in its financial statements an accrual for a potential payment to, or recovery from, the risk adjustment program depending on how its loss ratio compares to the industry wide loss ratio. To determine the amount of this risk adjustment, knowledge of industry wide performance is necessary. The NYSDFS does not share the industry loss ratio data for the current reporting year until the following year. However, the Company uses unaudited industry available information to make its best estimate of its potential payment under the risk adjustment program until actual information is available.\nWe cannot predict the full effect of the risk adjustment program on the Company at this time, but it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may prove to be ineffective and leave us exposed to unidentified or unanticipated risk, which could adversely affect our businesses or result in losses.\nWe have developed an enterprise-wide risk management and governance framework to mitigate risk and loss to the Company. We maintain policies, procedures and controls intended to identify, measure, monitor, report and analyze the risks to which we are exposed. However, our enterprise risk management policies and procedures may not be sufficiently comprehensive and may not identify every risk to which we are exposed. There are inherent limitations to risk management strategies because there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated or identified. If our risk management framework proves ineffective, we may suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected. As our business changes and the markets in which we operate evolve, our risk management framework may not evolve at the same pace as those changes. As a result, there is a risk that new products or new business strategies may present risks that are not appropriately identified, monitored or managed. In times of market stress, unanticipated market movements or unanticipated claims experience, the effectiveness of our risk management strategies may be limited, resulting in losses to the Company. In addition, we may have to implement more extensive and perhaps different risk management policies and procedures in the future due to legal and regulatory requirements, which could result in increased costs and may adversely affect our results of operations.\nMany of our risk management strategies or techniques are based upon historical customer and market behavior and all such strategies and techniques are based to some degree on management\u2019s subjective judgment. We cannot provide assurance that our risk management framework, including the underlying assumptions or strategies, will be accurate and effective.\nRisks related to our Industry\nOur industry is highly regulated and we are subject to extensive governmental regulation, which may adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives. Also, changes in regulations may affect our businesses and reduce our profitability and limit our growth. Moreover, if we fail to comply with these regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including fines and suspensions, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe insurance industry is extensively regulated and supervised. Insurance regulatory authorities generally design insurance rules and regulations to protect the interests of policyholders, and not necessarily the interests of insurers, their stockholders or other investors. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to state insurance laws and regulated by the insurance departments of the various states in which they are domiciled and licensed, which, among other things, conduct periodic examination of insurance companies. The regulations of each state are unique and complex and subject to change, and certain states may have regulations that conflict with the regulations of other states in which we operate. As a result, we are subject to the risk that compliance with the regulations in one state may not result in compliance with the regulations in another state. State laws grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to various aspects of our insurance businesses, including:\nolicensing companies and agents to transact business and regulating their respective conduct in the market;\norestricting agreements with large revenue-producing agents;\noapproving policy forms and premium rates;\nocancelling and non-renewal of policies;\norequiring certain methods of accounting and prescribing the form and content of records of financial condition required to be filed;\nocalculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements;\noestablishing statutory capital and reserve requirements, such as for unearned premiums and losses;\noregulating certain premium rates and requiring deposits for the benefit of policyholders;\noestablishing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies;\noestablishing standards of solvency, including risk-based capital measurements, which are a measure developed by the NAIC and used by state insurance regulators to identify insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized;\nomandating certain insurance benefits and restricting the size of risks insurable under a single policy;\noregulating unfair trade and claims practices, including the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements;\norequiring the filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies, holding company issues and other matters;\noapproving changes in control of insurance companies;\norestricting transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates, including the payment of dividends to affiliates; and\noregulating the nature or types, concentration or amounts, quality and valuation of investments.\nCurrently, the U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance. However, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), which was signed into law in July 2010 by President Obama, expanded the U.S. federal government\u2019s presence in insurance oversight, streamlined state-based regulation of reinsurance and non-admitted insurance and established a new Federal Insurance Office with powers over most lines of insurance other than health insurance. The Federal Insurance Office is authorized to gather data and information to monitor aspects of the insurance industry, identify issues in the regulation of insurers about insurance matters, and preempt state insurance measures under certain circumstances. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act, along with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, regulates corporate governance, executive compensation and other areas, as well as laws relating to federal trade restrictions, privacy/data security and terrorism risk insurance laws. Additionally, federal legislation and administrative policies in other areas can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies, including general financial services regulation, securities regulation, privacy regulation, tort reform legislation, and taxation.\nThe Trump administration and the Republican party have expressed goals to dismantle or roll back Dodd-Frank and President Trump has issued an executive order that calls for a comprehensive review of Dodd-Frank in light of certain enumerated core principles of financial system regulation. In June 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Financial CHOICE Act, which amends or repeals certain regulations in the Dodd-Frank Act, specifically modifying provisions related to insurance regulation. In March 2018, this legislation was passed by the U.S. Senate and signed into law by the President, in May 2018. We are not able to predict whether such roll back will have a material effect on our business operations and cannot currently identify the risks, if any, that may be posed to our businesses as a result of the changes.\nWe are uncertain as to the impact that any new legislation and regulatory guidance will have on the Company and cannot assure that it will not adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance efforts and other expenses of doing business.\nChanges in regulation, or the application thereof, may reduce our profitability and limit our growth.\nLegislation or other regulatory reform that increases the regulatory requirements imposed on us or that changes the way we are able to do business may significantly harm our business or results of operations in the future. Further, state insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations or in interpretations or enforcement thereof, enactment of new laws or regulations, or new judicial decisions affecting the insurance industry, are often made for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and thus could have an adverse effect on our business. Such changes to insurance laws or regulations, or new insurance laws and regulations, may be more restrictive than current laws or regulations and could significantly increase our compliance costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our prospects for future growth. We cannot predict what impact, if any, the results of these studies or other such proposals, if enacted, may have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If we were unable for any reason to comply with these requirements, it could result in substantial costs to us and may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nSeveral proposals have been adopted or are currently pending to amend state insurance holding company laws to increase the scope of insurance holding company regulation. The timing of their adoption and content will vary by state. These proposals include the NAIC \u201cSolvency Modernization Initiative,\u201d which focuses on capital requirements, as well as the Own Risk Solvency Assessment Model Act (\u201cORSA Model Act\u201d), which, when adopted by a state, requires large- and medium-sized U.S. insurers and insurance groups to regularly perform an ORSA and file a confidential ORSA Summary Report of the assessment with the regulator of each insurance company upon request. The ORSA is a confidential internal assessment appropriate to the nature, scale and complexity of an insurer of the material and relevant risks identified by the insurer associated with an insurer\u2019s current business plan and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks. The ORSA Model Act must be adopted by a state legislature in order to be effective in that state.\nWe cannot predict the full effect of these or any other regulatory initiatives on the Company at this time, but they could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nChanges to health insurance laws may adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough health insurance is generally regulated at the state level, actions at the federal level have affected and will likely continue to affect our business. Since the ACA became law in March 2010, it has caused sweeping and fundamental changes to the U.S. health care and health insurance industries. The effects on our business include our decisions to exit the major medical business, which is directly affected by the ACA, and to focus on ancillary health insurance products that are only indirectly affected by the ACA.\nThe ACA also affects us as an employer because it significantly affects the provision of both health care services and benefits in the United States. The ACA may impact our cost of providing our employees with health insurance and/or benefits, and may also impact various other aspects of our business. We are continually assessing the impact of the ACA on our health care benefit costs.\nThe Trump Administration has and will undoubtedly continue to have an impact on the ACA. President Trump supports widespread healthcare reform and the repeal of all or portions of the ACA. On October 12, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order that ordered the Secretaries of the Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services to consider proposing regulations or revising guidance to (i) allow more employers to form association health plans, (ii) expand the availability of short-term limited duration insurance and allow longer coverage periods and (iii) increase the usability of health reimbursement arrangements. Effective for months beginning after December 31, 2018, the Tax Reform Bill provides for the repeal of the provision of the ACA which requires individuals without minimum health coverage to pay a penalty, which is commonly referred to as the individual mandate. In December 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the entire ACA is invalid based primarily on the fact that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 repealed the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year as the result of the individual mandate. While the appeals court agreed with the state court that a single provision of the ACA is now unconstitutional, it sent the case back down to the state court with instructions that it must identify which other provisions of the law, if any, are unconstitutional and should be stricken from the law. An increase in the size of the uninsured population or a reduction in funds presently available to patients as a result of the repeal of this provision or the potential repeal of other significant portions of the ACA could adversely affect multiple businesses in the healthcare industry. While we are unable to predict what additional legislation or regulation, if any, relating to the health insurance industry may be enacted in the future or what effect such legislation or regulation would have on our business, it is clear that the Trump Administration is taking concrete steps to provided more healthcare options to consumers. The unsettled nature of reforms, the numerous steps required to implement them, and the potential repeal makes us unable to predict what additional health insurance requirements will be implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect that any future legislation or regulation will have on our business or our growth opportunities.\nWe will continue to monitor efforts to amend or impact the ACA and reassess our business strategies accordingly. We have made, and are continuing to make, significant changes to our operations, products and strategy to adapt to the new environment. However, if our plans for operating in the new environment are unsuccessful or are less successful than our competitors, or if there is less demand than we expect for our products in the new environment, our results could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to comply with extensive state and federal regulations, we will be subject to penalties, which may include fines and suspension and which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nSome states have imposed time limits for the payment of uncontested covered claims and require health care and dental service plans to pay interest on uncontested claims not paid promptly within the required time period. Some states have also granted their insurance regulatory agencies additional authority to impose monetary penalties and other sanctions on health and dental plans engaging in certain unfair payment practices. If we were unable, for any reason, to comply with these requirements, it could result in substantial costs to us and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nA large portion of our business depends on our compliance with applicable laws and regulations and our ability to maintain valid licenses and approvals for our operations. Regulatory authorities have broad discretion to grant, renew, revoke or deny licenses and approvals. In some instances, we follow practices based on our interpretations of regulations, or interpretations that we believe to be generally followed by the industry, which may be different from the requirements or interpretations of regulatory authorities. If we do not have the requisite licenses and approvals and do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements, the insurance regulatory authorities could preclude or temporarily suspend us from carrying on some or all of our insurance-related activities or otherwise penalize us. That type of action could have a material adverse effect on our business. Also, changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry (whether federal, state or foreign), or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates because the insurance and reinsurance business is historically cyclical, which could cause our results to fluctuate.\nThe insurance and reinsurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity, as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted an increase in pricing and, thus, more favorable premium levels. An increase in premium levels is often, over time, offset by an increasing supply of insurance and reinsurance capacity, either by capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of additional capital by existing insurers or reinsurers, which may cause prices to decrease. Any of these factors could lead to a significant reduction in premium rates, less favorable policy terms and fewer opportunities to underwrite insurance risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nFailures elsewhere in the insurance industry could obligate us to pay assessments through guaranty associations.\nVirtually all states require insurers licensed to do business in that state to bear a portion of the loss suffered by some insureds as the result of impaired or insolvent insurance companies or to bear a portion of the cost of insurance for high-risk or uninsured individuals. When an insurance company becomes insolvent, state insurance guaranty associations have the right to assess other insurance companies doing business in their state for funds to pay obligations to policyholders of the insolvent company, up to the state-specific limit of coverage. Depending on state law, insurers can be assessed up to 2% of premium written for the relevant line of insurance in that state. The total amount of the assessment is based on the number of insured residents in each state, and each company\u2019s portion is based on its proportionate share of premium volume in the relevant lines of business. The future failure of a large life, health or annuity insurer could trigger assessments that we would be obligated to pay. Further, amounts for historical insolvencies may be assessed over many years, and there can be significant uncertainty around the total obligation for a given insolvency. Existing liabilities may not be sufficient to fund the ultimate obligations of a historical insolvency, and we may be required to increase our liability, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nEconomic, governmental and competitive factors, and changes in societal attitudes such as work ethic, motivation or stability, can significantly affect the demand for and underwriting results from disability products.\nBoth economic and societal factors can affect claim incidence and recoveries for disability insurance. Claim incidence and claim recovery rates may be influenced by, among other factors, the rate of unemployment and consumer confidence and the emergence of new infectious diseases or illnesses. Claim durations may be extended by medical improvements that could extend life expectancies. These factors and overall incidence rates affect pricing, underwriting and adjudication of claims.\nGroup life and disability insurance may be affected by the characteristics of the employees insured, the amount of insurance employees may elect voluntarily, our risk selection process, our ability to retain employer groups with favorable risk characteristics, the geographical concentration of employees, and mortality rates. Claim incidence may also be influenced by unexpected catastrophic events such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and pandemic health events, which may also affect the cost of and availability of reinsurance coverage. Although pricing and renewal actions can be taken in reaction to higher claim rates, these actions take time to implement, and there is a risk that the market will not sustain increased prices. In addition, changes in economic and external conditions may not manifest themselves in claims experience for an extended period of time. It is difficult to predict how the above factors will affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 43837, "SIC": 6321, "TIC": "IHC"}
