{"cik": "874015", "company": "IONIS PHARMACEUTICALS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following information about the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this report and in our other public filings in evaluating our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business could be materially harmed, and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you might lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics. To date, we believe the impacts of the recent COVID-19 pandemic on our business are limited and manageable.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by health epidemics in regions where we or our partners are commercializing our medicines, have concentrations of clinical trial sites or other business operations, and could cause significant disruption in the operations of third-party manufacturers and contract research organizations upon whom we rely. For example, since December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causing a disease referred to as COVID-19, has spread worldwide. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, or the COVID-19 Pandemic, and the U.S. government imposed restrictions on travel between the U.S., Europe and certain other countries. In addition, the Governor of the State of California and the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the states in which our offices are located, each declared a state of emergency related to the spread of COVID-19 and issued executive orders that directed residents to stay at home.\nIn response to these public health directives and orders, in March 2020, we implemented work-from-home policies for most of our employees globally and generally suspended business-related travel. In the U.S., as vaccinations have become more widely available, states have lifted restrictions implemented as part of the pandemic response and reopened their economies. In June 2021, the Governor of California terminated the vast majority of executive actions that were put in place beginning in March 2020, leaving only a subset of provisions that facilitate the ongoing recovery. In May 2021, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts also lifted most of its pandemic restrictions. We continue to modify our policies for our employees in California, Massachusetts, and internationally to align with current local guidance. We believe the effects of these work-from-home and travel policies have had a limited impact on our business.\nThese public health directives and orders have impacted our and our partners\u2019 sales efforts. For example, some physician and hospital policies that have been put in place as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic restrict in-person access by third parties, which has in some cases impacted our commercialization efforts for TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA. Additionally, Biogen has reported that it is monitoring the demand for SPINRAZA, including the duration and degree to which it might see delays in starting new patients on SPINRAZA due to hospitals diverting resources necessary to administer SPINRAZA to care for COVID-19 patients. These and similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in our or our partner\u2019s commercial operations could materially impact our business, operating results and financial condition in the future.\nQuarantines, shelter-in-place, executive and similar government orders, or the perception that such orders, shutdowns or other restrictions on the conduct of business operations could occur, could impact personnel at third-party manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and other countries, or the availability or cost of materials, which would disrupt our supply chain. Recently there have been major disruptions to the global supply chain due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. To date, we have not experienced any significant consequences to our business as a result of the current supply chain disruptions, but could in the future if such disruptions persist or worsen.\nWe have experienced impacts to our clinical trial operations due to the COVID-19 Pandemic; however, we believe such impacts are limited and manageable. Some examples of these impacts include:\n\u25cf\ndelays in clinical site initiation, site monitoring and patient enrollment due to restrictions imposed as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic;\no\nFor example, in March 2020, we instituted a temporary suspension of enrollment for new subjects in our Phase 3 studies of eplontersen based on advice from our trial advisory committee; however, enrollment has resumed.\n\u25cf\nsome patients have not been able to meet protocol requirements, as quarantines have impeded patient movement and interrupted healthcare services;\n\u25cf\ndelays in site initiations due to principle investigators and site staff focusing on and prioritizing COVID-19 patient care; and\n\u25cf\ndelays in necessary interactions with regulators, ethics committees and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government or contractor personnel.\nIn addition, some of our partners have experienced impacts to their clinical trial operations as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic. For example, in December 2021, Novartis announced that enrollment for the Phase 3 HORIZON study had been delayed due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused a broad impact globally. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, the COVID-19 Pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, it could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and has and could continue to affect the value of our securities.\nThe global COVID-19 Pandemic continues to rapidly evolve. While we have not yet experienced material adverse effects to our business as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. As such, we do not yet know the full extent of delays or impacts on our business, our clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 Pandemic closely.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of our Medicines\nWe have limited experience as a company in commercializing medicines and we will have to invest significant resources to develop these capabilities. If we are unable to establish effective marketing, sales, market access, distribution, and related functions, or enter into agreements with third parties to commercialize our medicines, we may not be able to generate revenue from our medicines.\nWe have limited experience as a company in commercializing medicines and we will have to invest significant financial and management resources to develop the infrastructure required to successfully commercialize our medicines. There are significant risks involved in building and managing a sales organization, including our ability to hire, retain and incentivize qualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel, and effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team. We will also need to scale-up existing internal support functions to aid our commercialization efforts, in particular, regulatory affairs and medical affairs. Any failure to effectively build or maintain the infrastructure required to successfully commercialize our medicines, including our sales, marketing, market access, distribution, and related capabilities, or scale-up our existing support functions, could adversely impact the revenue we generate from our medicines. In addition, if we choose to rely on third parties to assist us in commercializing our medicines, we may not be able to enter into collaborations or hire consultants or external service providers on acceptable financial terms, or at all. If we do engage third parties to assist us in the commercialization of our medicines, our product revenues and profitability may be lower than if we commercialized such medicines ourselves.\nIf the market does not accept our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, and our medicines in development, we are not likely to generate substantial revenues or become consistently profitable.\nEven if our medicines are authorized for marketing, our success will depend upon the medical community, patients and third-party payers accepting our medicines as medically useful, cost-effective, safe and convenient. Even when the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities authorize our or our partners\u2019 medicines for commercialization, doctors may not prescribe our medicines to treat patients. Furthermore, we and our partners may not successfully commercialize additional medicines.\nAdditionally, in many of the markets where we or our partners may sell our medicines in the future, if we or our partners cannot agree with the government or other third-party payers regarding the price we can charge for our medicines, then we may not be able to sell our medicines in that market. Similarly, cost control initiatives by governments or third-party payers could decrease the price received for our medicines or increase patient coinsurance to a level that makes our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, and our medicines in development, economically unviable. If the pricing of any of our medicines decreases for any reason, it will reduce our revenue for such medicine. For example, Biogen has disclosed that SPINRAZA revenue has decreased in part due to lower pricing in the U.S. and certain rest of world markets.\nThe degree of market acceptance for our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, and our medicines in development, depends upon a number of factors, including the:\n\u25cf\nreceipt and scope of marketing authorizations;\n\u25cf\nestablishment and demonstration in the medical and patient community of the efficacy and safety of our medicines and their potential advantages over competing products;\n\u25cf\ncost and effectiveness of our medicines compared to other available therapies;\n\u25cf\npatient convenience of the dosing regimen for our medicines; and\n\u25cf\nreimbursement policies of government and third-party payers.\nBased on the profile of our medicines, physicians, patients, patient advocates, payers or the medical community in general may not accept or use any medicines that we may develop.\nFor example, TEGSEDI requires periodic blood and urine monitoring, is available in the U.S. only through a REMS program, and the product label in the U.S. has a boxed warning for thrombocytopenia and glomerulonephritis. Our main competition in the U.S. market for TEGSEDI is patisiran, marketed by Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Although patisiran requires intravenous administration and pre-treatment with steroids, it does not have a boxed warning nor is it available only through a REMS program. Additionally, the product label for WAYLIVRA in the EU requires regular blood monitoring. In each case, these label requirements have negatively affected our ability to attract and retain patients for these medicines. If we or our partner cannot effectively maintain patients on TEGSEDI or WAYLIVRA, including due to limitations or restrictions on the ability to conduct periodic blood and urine monitoring of our patients as a result of the current COVID-19 Pandemic, we may not be able to generate substantial revenue from TEGSEDI or WAYLIVRA sales.\nIf we or our partners fail to compete effectively, our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, and our medicines in development, will not generate significant revenues.\nOur competitors engage in drug discovery throughout the world, are numerous, and include, among others, major pharmaceutical companies and specialized biopharmaceutical firms. Other companies are engaged in developing antisense technology. Our competitors may succeed in developing medicines that are:\n\u25cf\npriced lower than our medicines;\n\u25cf\nreimbursed more favorably by government and other third-party payers than our medicines;\n\u25cf\nsafer than our medicines;\n\u25cf\nmore effective than our medicines; or\n\u25cf\nmore convenient to use than our medicines.\nThese competitive developments could make our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, and our medicines in development, obsolete or non-competitive.\nCertain of our partners are pursuing other technologies or developing other medicines either on their own or in collaboration with others, including our competitors, to treat the same diseases our own collaborative programs target. Competition may negatively impact a partner\u2019s focus on and commitment to our medicines and, as a result, could delay or otherwise negatively affect the commercialization of our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA.\nMany of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater experience than we do in conducting preclinical testing and human clinical studies of new pharmaceutical products, in obtaining FDA and other regulatory authorizations of such products and in commercializing such products. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory authorization for products earlier than we do.\nThere are several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies engaged in the development or commercialization in certain geographic markets of products against targets that are also targets of products in our development pipeline. For example:\n\u25cf\nOnasemnogene abeparvovec and risdiplam compete with SPINRAZA;\n\u25cf\nPatisiran, tafamidis, and tafamidis meglumine compete with TEGSEDI and could compete with eplontersen;\n\u25cf\nVutrisiran and acoramidis could compete with TEGSEDI and eplontersen;\n\u25cf\nARO-APOC3, lomitapide, evinacumab, BIO89-100, and gemcabene could compete with WAYLIVRA and olezarsen;\n\u25cf\nAMG890 could compete with pelacarsen;\n\u25cf\nArimoclomol, ultomiris, mastinib and trehalose could compete with tofersen; and\n\u25cf\nLanadelumab-flyo, C1 esterase inhibitor, berotralstat, C1 esterase inhibitor subcutaneous, garadacimab, KVD824, and NTLA-2002 could compete with donidalorsen.\nSPINRAZA injection for intrathecal use is an antisense medicine indicated for the treatment of SMA patients of all ages approved in over 50 countries. Specifically, SPINRAZA faces competition from onasemnogene abeparvovec, a gene therapy product that was approved in the U.S. in May 2019 and in the EU in May 2020 for the treatment of SMA, as well as risdiplam, an oral product for the treatment of SMA that was approved in the U.S. in August 2020 and in the EU in March 2021. Biogen has disclosed that SPINRAZA revenue has decreased primarily due to a reduction in demand as a result of increased competition and that future sales of SPINRAZA may be adversely affected by competing products.\nAdditionally, companies that are developing medicines that target the same patient populations as our medicines in development may compete with us to enroll participants in the clinical trials for such medicines, which could make it more difficult for us to complete enrollment for these clinical trials.\nOur medicines could be subject to regulatory limitations following approval.\nFollowing approval of a medicine, we and our partners must comply with comprehensive government regulations regarding the manufacture, marketing and distribution of medicines. Promotional communications regarding prescription medicines must be consistent with the information in the product\u2019s approved labeling. We or our partners may not obtain the labeling claims necessary or desirable to successfully commercialize our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, and our medicines in development.\nThe FDA and foreign regulatory bodies have the authority to impose significant restrictions on an approved medicine through the product label and on advertising, promotional and distribution activities. For example:\n\u25cf\nin the U.S., TEGSEDI\u2019s label contains a boxed warning for thrombocytopenia and glomerulonephritis;\n\u25cf\nTEGSEDI requires periodic blood and urine monitoring; and\n\u25cf\nin the U.S., TEGSEDI is available only through a REMS program.\nPrescription medicines may be promoted only for the approved indications in accordance with the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.\nIn addition, when approved, the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority may condition approval on the performance of post-approval clinical studies or patient monitoring, which could be time consuming and expensive. For example, in connection with the conditional marketing approval for WAYLIVRA in the EU, we are required to conduct a post-authorization safety study to evaluate the safety of WAYLIVRA on thrombocytopenia and bleeding in FCS patients taking WAYLIVRA. If the results of such post-marketing studies are not satisfactory, the FDA, EC or other foreign regulatory authority may withdraw marketing authorization or may condition continued marketing on commitments from us or our partners that may be expensive and time consuming to fulfill.\nIf we or others identify side effects after any of our medicines are on the market, or if manufacturing problems occur subsequent to regulatory approval, or if we, our manufacturers or our partners fail to comply with regulatory requirements, we or our partners may, among other things, lose regulatory approval and be forced to withdraw products from the market, need to conduct additional clinical studies, incur restrictions on the marketing, distribution or manufacturing of the product, and/or change the labeling of our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA.\nWe depend on our collaboration with Biogen for the development and commercialization of SPINRAZA.\nWe have entered into a collaborative arrangement with Biogen to develop and commercialize SPINRAZA. We entered into this collaboration primarily to:\n\u25cf\nfund our development activities for SPINRAZA;\n\u25cf\nseek and obtain regulatory approvals for SPINRAZA; and\n\u25cf\nsuccessfully commercialize SPINRAZA.\nWe are relying on Biogen to obtain additional regulatory approvals for SPINRAZA, generate additional clinical data for SPINRAZA, manufacture and successfully commercialize SPINRAZA. In general, we cannot control the amount and timing of resources that Biogen devotes to our collaboration. If Biogen fails to further develop SPINRAZA, obtain additional regulatory approvals for SPINRAZA, manufacture or commercialize SPINRAZA, or if Biogen\u2019s efforts are not effective, our business may be negatively affected.\nOur collaboration with Biogen may not continue for various reasons. Biogen can terminate our collaboration at any time. If Biogen stops developing or commercializing SPINRAZA, we would have to seek or spend additional funding, and SPINRAZA\u2019s commercialization may be harmed or delayed.\nOur collaboration with Biogen may not result in the continued successful commercialization of SPINRAZA. If Biogen does not continue to successfully commercialize SPINRAZA, we will receive limited revenues for SPINRAZA.\nWe depend on our collaboration with AstraZeneca for the joint development and commercialization of eplontersen.\nWe have entered into a collaborative arrangement with AstraZeneca to develop and commercialize eplontersen. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, Ionis and AstraZeneca will co-develop and co-commercialize eplontersen in the U.S. and AstraZeneca will have the sole right to commercialize eplontersen in all other countries. Prior to co-commercializing eplontersen in the U.S., we will need to negotiate a co-commercialization agreement with AstraZeneca to govern the parties\u2019 performance of co-commercialization, which agreement will include a commercial plan and budget. As a company we do not have experience with co-commercialization arrangements. We also do not have control over the amount and timing of resources that AstraZeneca devotes to our collaboration, particularly outside of the U.S. If the co-commercialization arrangement for eplontersen is not successful for any reason, eplontersen may not meet our commercial objectives and our revenues for eplontersen may be limited.\nIn addition, a Joint Steering Committee, or JSC, having equal membership from us and AstraZeneca, and various subcommittees oversee and coordinate the development, manufacturing, commercialization and other exploitation activities for eplontersen in the U.S. by mutual agreement. If any subcommittee cannot reach unanimous agreement on any matter within its respective scope of authority, such matter may be referred to the JSC for resolution. If the JSC cannot come to a mutual agreement on any particular matter, this could delay our ability to develop or commercialize eplontersen.\nWe are relying on third parties to market, sell and distribute TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA.\nWe have entered into agreements with third parties to commercialize TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA as follows:\n\u25cf\nIn April 2021, we entered into a distribution agreement with Sobi to commercialize TEGSEDI in the U.S. and Canada;\n\u25cf\nIn December 2020, we entered into a distribution agreement with Sobi to commercialize TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA in Europe; and\n\u25cf\nIn August 2018, we granted PTC the exclusive right to commercialize TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA in Latin America and certain Caribbean countries.\nWe are relying on Sobi and PTC to effectively market, sell and distribute TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA and have less control over sales efforts and may receive less revenue than if we commercialized TEGSEDI or WAYLIVRA by ourselves. If Sobi or PTC does not successfully commercialize TEGSEDI or WAYLIVRA, including as a result of delays or disruption caused by the current COVID-19 Pandemic, we may receive limited revenue for TEGSEDI or WAYLIVRA in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Latin America or certain Caribbean countries, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to additional healthcare laws.\nOur operations are subject to additional healthcare laws, including federal and state anti-kickback laws, false claims laws, transparency laws, such as the federal Sunshine Act, and health information privacy and security laws, which are subject to change at any time. For example, in November 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a final rule modifying the anti-kickback law safe harbors for Medicare Part D plans, pharmacies, and pharmaceutical benefit managers. Efforts to ensure that our operations comply with current applicable healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. Penalties for violations of applicable healthcare laws and regulations may include significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and additional reporting requirements and oversight if we enter into a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. In addition, violations may also result in reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings.\nIf government or other third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and payment rates for our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, and our medicines in development, our revenue will be limited.\nIn both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our current and future products will depend in part upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. The majority of patients in the U.S. who would fit within our target patient populations for our medicines have their healthcare supported by a combination of Medicare coverage, other government health programs such as Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new medicines when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Assuming coverage is approved, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be enough to make our medicines affordable. Even if favorable coverage status and adequate reimbursement rates are attained, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. Accordingly, SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, and our medicines in development, will face competition from other therapies and medicines for limited financial resources. We or our partners may need to conduct post-marketing studies to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of any future products to satisfy third-party payers. These studies might require us to commit a significant amount of management time and financial and other resources. Third-party payers may never consider our future products as cost-effective. Adequate third-party coverage and reimbursement might not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.\nThird-party payers, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the U.S., no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for medicines exists among third-party payers. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for medicines can differ significantly from payer to payer. For example, the Affordable Care Act was passed in March 2010, and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and continues to significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, as well as efforts to repeal or replace certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. It is unclear how future litigation and healthcare reform measures will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business.\nFurther, we believe that future coverage, reimbursement and pricing will likely be subject to increased restrictions both in the U.S. and in international markets. In the U.S., recent health reform measures have resulted in reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, and there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries, legislation and executive orders designed to, among other things, reduce drug prices (e.g., by supporting drug price negotiation in Medicare Parts B and D, with those negotiated prices also available to commercial plans, and progressing legislation to slow price increases over time on existing drugs), increase competition (e.g., by supporting legislation to speed the entry of biosimilar and generic drugs, including shortening the period of exclusivity, policies in Medicare Part B to increase the prescribing of biosimilars by physicians, and a prohibition on \u201cpay-for-delay\u201d agreements and anti-competitive practices by drug manufacturers), lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients (e.g., by capping Medicare Part D beneficiary out-of-pocket pharmacy expenses), and foster scientific innovation to promote better health care and improved health (e.g., by investing in public and private research and incentivizing the market to promote discovery of valuable and accessible new treatments). At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Third-party coverage and reimbursement for medicines may not be available or adequate in either the U.S. or international markets, and third-party payers, whether foreign or domestic, or governmental or commercial, may allocate their resources to address the current COVID-19 Pandemic or experience delays or disruptions in their ability to devote resources to coverage and reimbursement matters related to our products or medicines as a result of the COVID-19 Pandemic, which would negatively affect the potential commercial success of our products, our revenue and our profits.\nIf we cannot manufacture our medicines or contract with a third party to manufacture our medicines at costs that allow us to charge competitive prices to buyers, we cannot market our products profitably.\nTo successfully commercialize any of our medicines, we would need to optimize and manage large-scale commercial manufacturing capabilities either on a standalone basis or through a third-party manufacturer. We rely on third-party manufacturers to supply the drug substance and drug product for TEGSEDI and drug product for WAYLIVRA. Any delays or disruption to our own or third-party commercial manufacturing capabilities, including any interruption to our supply chain as a result of the current COVID-19 Pandemic, could limit the commercial success of our medicines. In addition, as our drug development and commercial pipeline increases and matures, we will have a greater need for clinical trial and commercial manufacturing capacity. For example, we have plans to expand our manufacturing infrastructure to support our wholly owned pipeline. If we are not successful in executing this expansion, it could limit our ability to meet our manufacturing requirements and commercial objectives in the future.\nAdditionally, we have limited experience manufacturing pharmaceutical products of the chemical class represented by our medicines, called oligonucleotides, on a commercial scale for the systemic administration of a medicine. There are a small number of suppliers for certain capital equipment and raw materials that we use to manufacture our medicines, and some of these suppliers will need to increase their scale of production to meet our projected needs for commercial manufacturing. Further, we must continue to improve our manufacturing processes to allow us to reduce our drug costs. We or our partners may not be able to manufacture our medicines at a cost or in quantities necessary to make commercially successful products.\nAlso, manufacturers, including us, must adhere to the FDA\u2019s cGMP regulations and similar regulations in foreign countries, which the applicable regulatory authorities enforce through facilities inspection programs. We, our partners and our contract manufacturers may not comply or maintain compliance with cGMP, or similar foreign regulations. Non-compliance could significantly delay or prevent receipt of marketing authorizations for our medicines, including authorizations for SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, and our medicines in development, or result in enforcement action after authorization that could limit the commercial success of our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, and our medicines in development.\nRisks Related to the Development and Regulatory Approval of our Medicines\nIf we or our partners fail to obtain regulatory approval for our medicines and additional approvals for SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, we or our partners cannot sell them in the applicable markets.\nWe cannot guarantee that any of our medicines will be considered safe and effective or will be approved for commercialization. In addition, it is possible that SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA may not be approved in additional markets or for additional indications. We and our partners must conduct time-consuming, extensive and costly clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of each of our medicines before they can be approved or receive additional approvals for sale. We and our partners must conduct these studies in compliance with FDA regulations and with comparable regulations in other countries.\nWe and our partners may not obtain necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all, for our medicines. It is possible that regulatory agencies will not approve our medicines for marketing or SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI or WAYLIVRA in additional markets or for additional indications. If the FDA or another regulatory agency believes that we or our partners have not sufficiently demonstrated the safety or efficacy of any of our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, or our medicines in development, the agency will not approve the specific medicine or will require additional studies, which can be time consuming and expensive and will delay or harm commercialization of the medicine. For example, in August 2018 we received a complete response letter from the FDA regarding the new drug application for WAYLIVRA in which the FDA determined that the safety concerns identified with WAYLIVRA in our clinical development program outweighed the expected benefits of triglyceride lowering in patients with FCS. We also received a Non-W from Health Canada for WAYLIVRA in November 2018.\nThe FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities can delay, limit or deny approval of a medicine for many reasons, including:\n\u25cf\nsuch authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical studies;\n\u25cf\nwe or our partners may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or other regulatory authorities that a medicine is safe and effective for any indication;\n\u25cf\nsuch authorities may not accept clinical data from studies conducted at clinical facilities that have deficient clinical practices or that are in countries where the standard of care is potentially different from that in the U.S.;\n\u25cf\nwe or our partners may be unable to demonstrate that our medicine\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks to support approval;\n\u25cf\nsuch authorities may disagree with the interpretation of data from preclinical or clinical studies;\n\u25cf\nsuch authorities may find deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers who manufacture clinical and commercial supplies for our medicines, or may delay the inspection of such facilities due to restrictions related to the COVID-19 Pandemic; and\n\u25cf\nthe approval policies or regulations of such authorities or their prior guidance to us or our partners during clinical development may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nFailure to receive marketing authorization for our medicines, or failure to receive additional marketing authorizations for SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI or WAYLIVRA, or delays in these authorizations, could prevent or delay commercial introduction of the medicine, and, as a result, could negatively impact our ability to generate revenue from product sales.\nWe may not be able to benefit from orphan drug designation for our medicines.\nIn the U.S., under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a medicine as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process, but it can provide financial incentives, such as tax advantages and user-fee waivers, as well as longer regulatory exclusivity periods. The FDA has granted orphan drug designation to eplontersen for the treatment of patients with transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis. The FDA and EMA have granted orphan drug designation to TEGSEDI for the treatment of patients with polyneuropathy due to hATTR amyloidosis, to WAYLIVRA for the treatment of patients with FCS, and to tominersen for the treatment of patients with HD. In addition, the EMA has granted orphan drug designation to WAYLIVRA for the treatment of patients with FPL. Even if approval is obtained on a medicine that has been designated as an orphan drug, we may lose orphan drug exclusivity if the FDA or EMA determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if we cannot assure sufficient quantity of the applicable medicine to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition, or if a competitor is able to gain approval for the same medicine in a safer or more effective form or that makes a major contribution to patient care. If we lose orphan drug exclusivity on any of our medicines, we may face increased competition and lose market share for such medicine.\nIf the results of clinical testing indicate that any of our medicines are not suitable for commercial use, we may need to abandon one or more of our drug development programs.\nDrug discovery and development has inherent risks and the historical failure rate for drugs is high. Antisense medicines are a relatively new approach to therapeutics. If we cannot demonstrate that our medicines are safe and effective for human use in the intended indication, we may need to abandon one or more of our drug development programs.\nEven if our medicines are successful in preclinical and human clinical studies, the medicines may not be successful in late-stage clinical studies.\nSuccessful results in preclinical or initial human clinical studies, including the Phase 2 results for some of our medicines in development, may not predict the results of subsequent clinical studies. If any of our medicines in Phase 3 clinical studies, including the studies of eplontersen, olezarsen, donidalorsen, ION363, pelacarsen and tofersen, do not show sufficient efficacy in patients with the targeted indication, or if such studies are discontinued for any other reason, it could negatively impact our development and commercialization goals for these medicines and our stock price could decline.\nIn the past, we have invested in clinical studies of medicines that have not met the primary clinical endpoints in their Phase 3 studies or have been discontinued for other reasons. For example, in October 2021, Biogen reported that tofersen did not meet the primary clinical endpoint in the Phase 3 VALOR study; however, trends favoring tofersen were seen across multiple secondary and exploratory measures of disease activity and clinical function. In addition, in March 2021, Roche decided to discontinue dosing in the Phase 3 GENERATION HD1 study of tominersen in patients with manifest Huntington\u2019s disease based on the results of a pre-planned review of data from the Phase 3 study conducted by an unblinded Independent Data Monitoring Committee. Similar results could occur in clinical studies for our other medicines, including the studies of eplontersen, olezarsen, donidalorsen, ION363 and pelacarsen.\nThere are a number of factors that could cause a clinical study to fail or be delayed, including:\n\u25cf\nthe clinical study may produce negative or inconclusive results;\n\u25cf\nregulators may require that we hold, suspend or terminate clinical research for noncompliance with regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\nwe, our partners, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities could suspend or terminate a clinical study due to adverse side effects of a medicine on subjects or lack of efficacy in the trial;\n\u25cf\nwe, or our partners, may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional preclinical testing or clinical studies;\n\u25cf\nenrollment in our clinical studies may be slower than we anticipate;\n\u25cf\nwe or our partners, including our independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers on which we rely, may not identify, recruit and train suitable clinical investigators at a sufficient number of study sites or timely enroll a sufficient number of study subjects in the clinical study;\n\u25cf\nthe institutional review board for a prospective site might withhold or delay its approval for the study;\n\u25cf\npeople who enroll in the clinical study may later drop out due to adverse events, a perception they are not benefiting from participating in the study, fatigue with the clinical study process or personal issues;\n\u25cf\na clinical study site may deviate from the protocol for the study;\n\u25cf\nthe cost of our clinical studies may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u25cf\nour partners may decide not to exercise any existing options to license and conduct additional clinical studies for our medicines; and\n\u25cf\nthe supply or quality of our medicines or other materials necessary to conduct our clinical studies may be insufficient, inadequate or delayed.\nThe current COVID-19 Pandemic could make some of these factors more likely to occur.\nIn addition, our current medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, are chemically similar to each other. As a result, a safety observation we encounter with one of our medicines could have, or be perceived by a regulatory authority to have, an impact on a different medicine we are developing. This could cause the FDA or other regulators to ask questions or take actions that could harm or delay our ability to develop and commercialize our medicines or increase our costs. For example, the FDA or other regulatory agencies could request, among other things, any of the following regarding one of our medicines: additional information or commitments before we can start or continue a clinical study, protocol amendments, increased safety monitoring, additional product labeling information, and post-approval commitments. This happened in connection with the conditional marketing approval for WAYLIVRA in the EU, as the EC is requiring us to conduct a post-authorization safety study to evaluate the safety of WAYLIVRA on thrombocytopenia and bleeding in FCS patients taking WAYLIVRA. We have ongoing post-marketing studies for WAYLIVRA and TEGSEDI and an EAP for WAYLIVRA. Adverse events or results from these studies or the EAPs could negatively impact our pending or future marketing approval applications for WAYLIVRA and TEGSEDI in patients with FCS or hATTR amyloidosis or the commercial opportunity for WAYLIVRA or TEGSEDI.\nAny failure or delay in our clinical studies, including the studies of tofersen, pelacarsen, eplontersen, olezarsen, donidalorsen, and ION363, could reduce the commercial potential or viability of our medicines.\nWe depend on third parties to conduct our clinical studies for our medicines and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect our development and commercialization plans.\nWe depend on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to conduct our clinical studies for our medicines and expect to continue to do so in the future. For example, we use clinical research organizations, such as Icon Clinical Research Limited, Syneos Health, Inc., PPD and Medpace for the clinical studies for our medicines, including eplontersen, olezarsen, donidalorsen, ION363, pelacarsen and tofersen. We rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical studies, but do not control many aspects of their activities. For example, the investigators are not our employees. However, we are responsible for ensuring that these third parties conduct each of our clinical studies in accordance with the general investigational plan and approved protocols for the study. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical studies in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols. The failure of these third parties to carry out their obligations, including as a result of delays or disruption caused by the current COVID-19 Pandemic that may affect the third party\u2019s ability to conduct the clinical studies for our medicines, or a termination of our relationship with these third parties, could delay or prevent the development, marketing authorization and commercialization of our medicines or additional marketing authorizations for TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA.\nSince corporate partnering is a significant part of our strategy to fund the advancement and commercialization of our development programs, if any of our collaborative partners fail to fund our collaborative programs, or if we cannot obtain additional partners, we may have to delay or stop progress on our drug development programs.\nTo date, corporate partnering has played a significant role in our strategy to fund our development programs and to add key development resources. We plan to continue to rely on additional collaborative arrangements to develop and commercialize many of our unpartnered medicines. However, we may not be able to negotiate favorable collaborative arrangements for these drug programs. If we cannot continue to secure additional collaborative partners, our revenues could decrease and the development of our medicines could suffer.\nOur corporate partners are developing and/or funding many of the medicines in our development pipeline. For example, we are relying on:\n\u25cf\nAstraZeneca for the joint development and funding of eplontersen;\n\u25cf\nNovartis for development and funding of pelacarsen;\n\u25cf\nBiogen for development and funding of tofersen; and\n\u25cf\nRoche for development and funding of tominersen.\nIf any of these pharmaceutical companies stops developing and/or funding these medicines, our business could suffer and we may not have, or be willing to dedicate, the resources available to develop these medicines on our own. Our collaborators can terminate their relationships with us under certain circumstances, many of which are outside of our control. For example, after a review of data from the global Phase 2b study of vupanorsen, Pfizer decided to discontinue the clinical development program for vupanorsen.\nEven with funding from corporate partners, if our partners do not effectively perform their obligations under our agreements with them, it would delay or stop the progress of our drug development and commercial programs.\nIn addition to receiving funding, we enter into collaborative arrangements with third parties to:\n\u25cf\nconduct clinical studies;\n\u25cf\nseek and obtain marketing authorizations; and\n\u25cf\nmanufacture, market and sell our medicines.\nOnce we have secured a collaborative arrangement to further develop and commercialize one of our drug development programs, such as our collaborations with AstraZeneca, Bayer, Biogen, GSK, Janssen, Novartis, and Roche, these collaborations may not continue or result in commercialized medicines, or may not progress as quickly as we first anticipated.\nFor example, a collaborator such as AstraZeneca, Bayer, Biogen, GSK, Janssen, Novartis, or Roche, could determine that it is in its financial interest to:\n\u25cf\npursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products that may be competitive with the medicine that is part of the collaboration with us;\n\u25cf\npursue higher-priority programs or change the focus of its own development programs; or\n\u25cf\nchoose to devote fewer resources to our medicines than it does for its own medicines.\nIf any of these occur, it could affect our partner\u2019s commitment to the collaboration with us and could delay or otherwise negatively affect the commercialization of our medicines, including SPINRAZA, pelacarsen, tofersen, and eplontersen.\nIf we do not progress in our programs as anticipated, the price of our securities could decrease.\nFor planning purposes, we estimate and may disclose the timing of a variety of clinical, regulatory and other milestones, such as when we anticipate a certain medicine will enter clinical trials, when we anticipate completing a clinical study, or when we anticipate filing an application for, or obtaining, marketing authorization, or when we or our partners plan to commercially launch a medicine. We base our estimates on present facts and a variety of assumptions, many of which are outside of our control, including the current COVID-19 Pandemic. If we do not achieve milestones in accordance with our or our investors\u2019 or securities analysts\u2019 expectations, including milestones related to SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI, WAYLIVRA, eplontersen, olezarsen, donidalorsen, ION363, pelacarsen and tofersen, the price of our securities could decrease.\nRisks Associated with our Businesses as a Whole\nRisks related to our financial condition\nWe have incurred losses, and our business will suffer if we fail to consistently achieve profitability in the future.\nBecause drug discovery and development requires substantial lead-time and money prior to commercialization, our expenses have generally exceeded our revenue since we were founded in January 1989. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.2 billion and stockholders\u2019 equity of approximately $0.8 billion. Most of our historical losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations. Most of our income has come from collaborative arrangements, including commercial revenue from royalties and R&D revenue, with additional income from research grants and the sale or licensing of our patents, as well as interest income. If we do not continue to earn substantial revenue, we may incur additional operating losses in the future. We may not successfully develop any additional medicines or achieve or sustain future profitability.\nIf we fail to obtain timely funding, we may need to curtail or abandon some of our programs.\nMany of our medicines are undergoing clinical studies or are in the early stages of research and development. Most of our drug programs will require significant additional research, development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, marketing authorizations, preclinical activities and commitment of significant additional resources prior to their successful commercialization. These activities will require significant cash. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments equal to $2.1 billion. If we or our partners do not meet our goals to successfully commercialize our medicines, including SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, or to license certain medicines and proprietary technologies, we will need additional funding in the future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, such as the following:\n\u25cf\nsuccessful commercialization of SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA;\n\u25cf\nadditional marketing approvals for WAYLIVRA and TEGSEDI;\n\u25cf\nthe profile and launch timing of our medicines, including eplontersen, olezarsen, donidalorsen, ION363, pelacarsen and tofersen;\n\u25cf\nchanges in existing collaborative relationships and our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborative arrangements;\n\u25cf\ncontinued scientific progress in our research, drug discovery and development programs;\n\u25cf\nthe size of our programs and progress with preclinical and clinical studies;\n\u25cf\nthe time and costs involved in obtaining marketing authorizations;\n\u25cf\ncompeting technological and market developments, including the introduction by others of new therapies that address our markets; and\n\u25cf\nour manufacturing requirements and capacity to fulfill such requirements.\nIf we need additional funds, we may need to raise them through public or private financing. Additional financing may not be available at all or on acceptable terms. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, the shares of existing stockholders will be diluted and the price, as well as the price of our other securities, may decline. If adequate funds are not available or not available on acceptable terms, we may have to cut back on one or more of our research, drug discovery or development programs. Alternatively, we may obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others, which could require us to give up rights to certain of our technologies or medicines.\nRisks related to our intellectual property\nIf we cannot protect our patent rights or our other proprietary rights, others may compete more effectively against us.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon whether we can continue to develop, secure and maintain intellectual property rights to proprietary products and services. However, we may not receive issued patents on any of our pending patent applications in the U.S. or in other countries and we may not be able to obtain, maintain or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights which could impact our ability to compete effectively. In addition, the scope of any of our issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to provide us with a competitive advantage. Furthermore, other parties may successfully challenge, invalidate or circumvent our issued patents or patents licensed to us so that our patent rights do not create an effective competitive barrier or revenue source.\nWe cannot be certain that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or U.S. PTO, and courts in the U.S. or the patent offices and courts in foreign countries will consider the claims in our patents and applications covering SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI, WAYLIVRA, or any of our medicines in development as patentable. Method-of-use patents protect the use of a product for the specified method. This type of patent does not prevent a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product for an indication that is outside the scope of the patented method. Moreover, even if competitors do not actively promote their product for our targeted indications, physicians may prescribe these products off-label. Although off-label prescriptions may infringe or contribute to the infringement of method-of-use patents, the practice is common and such infringement is difficult to prevent, even through legal action.\nIf we or any licensor partner loses or cannot obtain patent protection for SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI, WAYLIVRA, or any of our other medicines in development, it could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIntellectual property litigation could be expensive and prevent us from pursuing our programs.\nFrom time to time we have to defend our intellectual property rights. If we are involved in an intellectual property dispute, we may need to litigate to defend our rights or assert them against others. Disputes can involve arbitration, litigation or proceedings declared by the U.S. PTO or the International Trade Commission or foreign patent authorities. Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nIf a third party claims that our medicines or technology infringe its patents or other intellectual property rights, we may have to discontinue an important product or product line, alter our products and processes, pay license fees or cease certain activities. We may not be able to obtain a license to needed intellectual property on favorable terms, if at all. There are many patents issued or applied for in the biotechnology industry, and we may not be aware of patents or patent applications held by others that relate to our business. This is especially true since patent applications in the U.S. are filed confidentially for the first 18 months. Moreover, the validity and breadth of biotechnology patents involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal issues remain.\nRisks related to our personnel\nIf our management transition is not successful our business could suffer.\nIn January 2020, Dr. Crooke, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, transitioned from Chief Executive Officer to Executive Chairman of our Board of Directors, and Dr. Monia, who was our Chief Operating Officer and a member of our team since our founding over 30 years ago, began serving as our Chief Executive Officer. Following the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, Dr. Crooke stepped down from the Board and now serves as a Strategic Advisor to the Company, providing strategic advice and continuing to participate in the Company\u2019s scientific activities. In June 2021, Dr. Loscalzo, a member of our Board since February 2014, was appointed Chairman of the Board. If this transition is not successful, our business could suffer.\nThe loss of key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, could make it more difficult to run our business and reduce our likelihood of success.\nWe are dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers that would prevent them from leaving us. The loss of our management and key scientific employees might slow the achievement of important research and development goals. It is also critical to our success that we recruit and retain qualified scientific personnel to perform research and development work. We may not be able to attract and retain skilled and experienced scientific personnel on acceptable terms because of intense competition for experienced scientists among many pharmaceutical and health care companies, universities and non-profit research institutions. In addition, failure to succeed in clinical studies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified scientific personnel.\nRisks related to taxes\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryovers and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation is generally allowed a deduction for net operating losses, or NOLs, carried over from a prior taxable year. Under the Code, we can carryforward our NOLs to offset our future taxable income, if any, until such NOLs are used or expire. The same is true of other unused tax attributes, such as tax credits.\nUnder the current U.S. federal income tax law, U.S. federal NOLs generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such U.S. federal NOLs in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020 is limited to 80 percent of taxable income. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to current U.S. federal income tax law, and there may be periods during which states suspend or otherwise limit the use of NOLs for state income tax purposes.\nIn addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage-point cumulative change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporation\u2019s ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control. If an ownership change occurs and our ability to use our NOL carryforwards or other tax attributes is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations. As a result of the Akcea Merger, we are subject to the separate return limitation year, or SRLY, rules. Under the SRLY rules, our utilization of Akcea\u2019s pre-merger NOL and tax credit carryforwards is limited to the amount of income that Akcea contributes to our consolidated taxable income. The Akcea pre-merger tax attributes cannot be used to offset any of the income that Ionis contributes to our consolidated taxable income. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of net operating losses is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed.\nOur future taxable income could be impacted by changes in tax laws, regulations and treaties.\nA change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation, of any country in which we operate could materially affect us.\nWe could be subject to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, sales taxes in the U.S., withholding taxes and transaction taxes in foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provision for taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many activities and transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our tax obligations and effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations, including those relating to income tax nexus, by recognizing tax losses or lower than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. We may be audited in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional taxes, sales taxes and value-added taxes against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any tax audits or litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period for which a determination is made.\nGeneral risk factors\nIf the price of our securities continues to be highly volatile, this could make it harder to liquidate your investment and could increase your risk of suffering a loss.\nThe market price of our common stock, like that of the securities of many other biopharmaceutical companies, has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile. These fluctuations in our common stock price may significantly affect the trading price of our securities. During the 12 months preceding December 31, 2021, the market price of our common stock ranged from $64.37 to $25.04 per share. Many factors can affect the market price of our securities, including, for example, fluctuations in our operating results, announcements of collaborations, clinical study results, technological innovations or new products being developed by us or our competitors, the commercial success of our approved medicines, governmental regulation, marketing authorizations, changes in payers\u2019 reimbursement policies, developments in patent or other proprietary rights and public concern regarding the safety of our medicines.\nThe current COVID-19 Pandemic has caused a significant disruption of global financial markets and has resulted in increased volatility in the trading price of our common stock. Additionally, broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general, and NASDAQ and the market for biotechnology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of ours, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for biotechnology or pharmaceutical stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to us, the opportunities in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical market or the stock market in general, could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation, convertible notes documents, call spread hedge transaction documents and Delaware law may prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides for classified terms for the members of our board of directors. Our certificate also includes a provision that requires at least 66 2/3 percent of our voting stockholders to approve a merger or certain other business transactions with, or proposed by, any holder of 15 percent or more of our voting stock, except in cases where certain directors approve the transaction or certain minimum price criteria and other procedural requirements are met.\nOur certificate of incorporation also requires that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be taken at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be taken by written consent. In addition, only our board of directors, chairman of the board or chief executive officer can call special meetings of our stockholders. We have in the past, and may in the future, implement a stockholders\u2019 rights plan, also called a poison pill, which could make it uneconomical for a third party to acquire our company on a hostile basis. In addition, our board of directors has the authority to fix the rights and preferences of, and issue shares of preferred stock, which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company without action by our stockholders.\nThe provisions of our convertible senior notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. Upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change, holders of the notes will have the right, at their option, to require us to repurchase all of their notes or a portion of their notes, which may discourage certain types of transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over the then current market prices.\nIn April 2021, we completed a $632.5 million offering of 0% Notes and used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of the 0% Notes to repurchase $247.9 million of our 1% Notes for $257.0 million. In December 2019, we entered into privately negotiated exchange and/or subscription agreements with certain new investors and certain holders of our existing 1% Notes to exchange $375.6 million of our 1% Notes for $439.3 million of our 0.125% Notes, and to issue $109.5 million of our 0.125% Notes. Additionally, in connection with the pricing of our 0% Notes and 0.125% Notes, we entered into call spread transactions in which we purchased note hedges and sold warrants. Terminating or unwinding the call spread transactions could require us to make substantial payments to the counterparties under those agreements or may increase our stock price. The costs or any increase in stock price that may arise from terminating or unwinding such agreements could make an acquisition of our company significantly more expensive to the purchaser.\nThese provisions, as well as Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and other of our agreements, may discourage certain types of transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices, and may limit the ability of our stockholders to approve transactions that they think may be in their best interests.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the trading price of our securities.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect trading prices of our securities. For example, we may issue approximately 17.5 million shares of our common stock upon conversion of our 0% Notes and 0.125% Notes, up to 10.9 million shares in connection with the warrant transactions we entered into in connection with the issuance of our 0% Notes, and up to 6.6 million shares in connection with the warrant transactions we entered into in connection with the issuance of our 0.125% Notes, in each case subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The addition of any of these shares into the public market may have an adverse effect on the price of our securities.\nIn addition, pursuant to the call spread transactions we entered into in connection with the pricing of our 0% Notes and 0.125% Notes, the counterparties are likely to modify their hedge positions from time to time at or prior to the conversion or maturity of the notes by purchasing and selling shares of our common stock, other of our securities, or other instruments, including over-the-counter derivative instruments, that they may wish to use in connection with such hedging, which may have a negative effect on the conversion value of those notes and an adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock. The call spread transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to holders of our common stock upon any conversion of our 0% Notes or 0.125% Notes or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of the converted 0% Notes or 0.125% Notes, as the case may be. However, the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants.\nWe are exposed to potential product liability claims, and insurance against these claims may not be available to us at a reasonable rate in the future or at all.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing, marketing and sale of therapeutic products, including potential product liability claims related to SPINRAZA, TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA, and our medicines in development. We have clinical study insurance coverage and commercial product liability insurance coverage. However, this insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover claims against us, or be available to us at an acceptable cost, if at all. Regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in decreased demand for our medicines, injury to our reputation, withdrawal of clinical study volunteers and loss of revenues. Thus, whether or not we are insured, a product liability claim or product recall may result in losses that could be material.\nWe are dependent on information technology systems, infrastructure and data, which exposes us to data security risks.\nWe are dependent upon our own and third-party information technology systems, infrastructure and data, including mobile technologies, to operate our business. The multitude and complexity of our computer systems may make them vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, disruption of data integrity, malicious intrusion, or random attacks. Likewise, data privacy or security incidents or breaches by employees or others may pose a risk that sensitive data, including our intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information of our employees, patients, customers or other business partners may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, with third-party phishing and social engineering attacks in particular increasing during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of-service, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Our business partners face similar risks and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect our security posture. A security breach or privacy violation that leads to disclosure or modification of or prevents access to patient information, including personally identifiable information or protected health information, could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with federal and state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to financial penalties and mandatory and costly corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to litigation or other liability under laws and regulations that protect personal data, any of which could disrupt our business and result in increased costs or loss of revenue. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information, trade secrets or other intellectual property. While we have invested, and continue to invest, in the protection of our data and information technology infrastructure, our efforts may not prevent service interruptions or identify breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business and operations and result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us. In addition, our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches.\nBecause we use biological materials, hazardous materials, chemicals and radioactive compounds, if we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur research, development and manufacturing activities involve the use of potentially harmful biological materials as well as materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds that could be hazardous to human health and safety or the environment. We store most of these materials and various wastes resulting from their use at our facilities in Carlsbad, California pending ultimate use and disposal. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause:\n\u25cf\ninterruption of our research, development and manufacturing efforts;\n\u25cf\ninjury to our employees and others;\n\u25cf\nenvironmental damage resulting in costly clean up; and\n\u25cf\nliabilities under federal, state and local laws and regulations governing health and human safety, as well as the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and resultant waste products.\nIn such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. Although we carry insurance in amounts and types that we consider commercially reasonable, we do not have insurance coverage for losses relating to an interruption of our research, development or manufacturing efforts caused by contamination, and the coverage or coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate. If our losses exceed our insurance coverage, our financial condition would be adversely affected.\nOur business may be adversely affected by climate change, extreme weather events, earthquakes, pandemics, civil or political unrest, terrorism or other catastrophic events.\nIn recent years, extreme weather events and changing weather patterns have become more common. As a result, we are potentially exposed to varying natural disaster or extreme weather risks such as hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, droughts, floods, or other events that may result from the impact of climate change on the environment. The potential impacts of climate change may also include increased operating costs associated with additional regulatory requirements and investments in reducing energy, water use and greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, we manufacture most of our research and clinical supplies in a manufacturing facility located in Carlsbad, California. We manufacture the finished drug product for TEGSEDI and WAYLIVRA at third-party contract manufacturers. Biogen manufactures the finished drug product for SPINRAZA. The facilities and the equipment we, our partners and our contract manufacturers use to research, develop and manufacture our medicines would be costly to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace. Our facilities or those of our partners or contract manufacturers may be harmed by natural disasters or other events outside our control, such as earthquakes, pandemics, war, civil or political unrest, deliberate acts of sabotage, terrorism or industrial accidents such as fire and explosion, whether due to human or equipment error, and if such facilities are affected by a disaster or other event, our development and commercialization efforts would be delayed. Although we possess property damage and business interruption insurance coverage, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, our development and commercialization activities could be harmed or delayed by a shutdown of the U.S. government, including the FDA.\nOur business is subject to changing regulations for corporate governance and public disclosure that has increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance.\nEach year we are required to evaluate our internal control systems in order to allow management to report on and our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm to attest to, our internal controls as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a result, we continue to incur additional expenses and divert our management\u2019s time to comply with these regulations. In addition, if we cannot continue to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, or The Nasdaq Global Select Market. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock.\nThe SEC and other regulators have continued to adopt new rules and regulations and make additional changes to existing regulations that require our compliance. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that require the SEC to adopt, or where the SEC has adopted, additional rules and regulations in these areas such as \u201csay on pay\u201d and proxy access. Stockholder activism, the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business.\nNegative conditions in the global credit markets and financial services and other industries may adversely affect our business.\nThe global credit markets, the financial services industry, the U.S. capital markets, and the U.S. economy as a whole are currently experiencing substantial turmoil and uncertainty characterized by unprecedented intervention by the U.S. federal government in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. In the past, the failure, bankruptcy, or sale of various financial and other institutions created similar turmoil and uncertainty in such markets and industries. It is possible that a crisis in the global credit markets, the U.S. capital markets, the financial services industry or the U.S. economy may adversely affect our business, vendors and prospects, as well as our liquidity and financial condition. More specifically, our insurance carriers and insurance policies covering all aspects of our business may become financially unstable or may not be sufficient to cover any or all of our losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, due to the rapidly rising inflation rate, we may experience increased costs of goods and services for our business.\nA variety of risks associated with operating our business and marketing our medicines internationally could adversely affect our business. In addition to our U.S. operations, we are commercializing TEGSEDI in the EU, Canada, Latin America and certain Caribbean countries, and WAYLIVRA in the EU, Latin America and certain Caribbean countries. We face risks associated with our international operations, including possible unfavorable regulatory, pricing and reimbursement, political, tax and labor conditions, which could harm our business. Because we have international operations, we are subject to numerous risks associated with international business activities, including:\n\u25cf\ncompliance with differing or unexpected regulatory requirements for our medicines and foreign employees;\n\u25cf\ncomplexities associated with managing multiple payer reimbursement regimes, government payers or patient self-pay systems;\n\u25cf\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u25cf\nin certain circumstances, increased dependence on the commercialization efforts and regulatory compliance of third-party distributors or strategic partners;\n\u25cf\nforeign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements;\n\u25cf\nU.S. and foreign government tariffs, trade restrictions, price and exchange controls and other regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf\nanti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and its equivalent in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u25cf\neconomic weakness, including inflation, natural disasters, war, events of terrorism, political instability or public health issues or pandemics, such as the current COVID-19 Pandemic, in particular foreign countries or globally;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations related to doing business in another country;\n\u25cf\ncompliance with tax, employment, privacy, immigration and labor laws, regulations and restrictions for employees living or traveling abroad;\n\u25cf\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the U.S.; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the E.U. could increase these risks.\nOur business activities outside of the U.S. are subject to the FCPA and similar anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the United Kingdom\u2019s Bribery Act 2010. In many other countries, the healthcare providers who prescribe pharmaceuticals are employed by their government, and the purchasers of pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, any dealings with these prescribers and purchasers may be subject to regulation under the FCPA. There is no certainty that all employees and third-party business partners (including our distributors, wholesalers, agents, contractors and other partners) will comply with anti-bribery laws. In particular, we do not control the actions of manufacturers and other third-party agents, although we may be liable for their actions. Violation of these laws may result in civil or criminal sanctions, which could include monetary fines, criminal penalties, and disgorgement of past profits, which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nThe impact on us of the vote by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union cannot be predicted.\nThe withdrawal of the UK from the EU, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d may adversely impact our ability to obtain regulatory approvals of our medicines in the EU, result in restrictions or imposition of taxes and duties for importing our medicines into the EU, and may require us to incur additional expenses in order to develop, manufacture and commercialize our medicines in the EU.\nFollowing the result of a referendum in 2016, the UK left the EU on January 31, 2020. Pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between the UK and the EU, the UK was subject to a transition period that ended December 31, 2020, or the Transition Period, during which EU rules continued to apply. A trade and cooperation agreement, or the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, that outlines the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU was signed in December 2020.\nSince a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the UK applicable to our business and our medicines is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit has had, and may continue to have, a material impact upon the regulatory regime with respect to the development, manufacture, importation, approval and commercialization of our medicines in the UK or the EU. For example, Great Britain is no longer covered by the centralized procedures for obtaining EU-wide marketing authorization from the EMA, and a separate marketing authorization will be required to market our medicines in Great Britain. It is currently unclear whether the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the UK is sufficiently prepared to handle the increased volume of marketing authorization applications that it is likely to receive. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, would delay or prevent us from commercializing our medicines in the UK or the EU.\nWhile the Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides for the tariff-free trade of medicinal products between the UK and the EU, there may be additional non-tariff costs to such trade which did not exist prior to the end of the Transition Period. Further, should the UK diverge from the EU from a regulatory perspective in relation to medicinal products, tariffs could be put into place in the future. We could therefore, both now and in the future, face significant additional expenses (when compared to the position prior to the end of the Transition Period) to operate our business.", "PERMNO": 76661, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "IONS"}
