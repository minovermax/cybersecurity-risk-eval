{"cik": "906780", "company": "EMPIRE RESORTS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nIn addition to the other information contained in this report on Form 10-K, the following Risk Factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to our Overall Business\nAlthough a substantial portion of the funds needed for the development of the Casino Project are in place, the completion of the Development Projects will require additional equity capital and debt financing. If the Company is unable to raise the additional financing needed to complete these projects, the Company\u2019s business will be materially adversely affected.\nAlthough the proceeds of the January 2016 Rights Offering, the Term Loan Agreement and the Kien Huat Montreign Loan Facility provide a substantial portion of the funds needed for the development of the Casino Project, the completion of the Development Projects will require additional capital, including furniture, fixture and equipment financing of up to $40 million and a deposit of $35 million into the lender-controlled account holding the net proceeds of the Term Loan Facility and the Kien Huat Montreign Loan, which amount will be used towards the Entertainment Village Project. Of this payment, $15 million is required to be deposited by June 30, 2017 and the remaining $20 million is required to be deposited by December 31, 2017. The $35 million must be funded in the form of a further equity contribution to Montreign Operating. The Company expects to raise additional equity capital by the dates on which the deposits must be made. The designs of the Golf Course Project and the Entertainment Village Project are not yet finalized and our cost estimates for those projects may change. In addition, cost overruns, delays in the construction schedule or changes in design are among the factors that may increase the projected costs of the Development Projects, which may also require us to raise additional capital. If we are unable to obtain the necessary financing on terms and conditions acceptable to the Company, we may need to curtail or cease the construction of the Development Projects and our business, financial condition and prospects will be materially adversely affected.\nAs a holding company, we are dependent on the operations of our subsidiary, MRMI, to pay dividends or make distributions in order to generate internal cash flow. Moreover, until the Casino Project is open to the public, none of our subsidiaries involved in the Development Projects will be generating revenue, which will adversely impact our cash flow.\nWe are a holding company with no revenue generating operations. Montreign Operating and its subsidiaries are responsible to develop the Development Projects, which will generate no revenues or cash flow until those projects are open to the public. The Casino Project, which we expect will be the first Development Project open to the public, is scheduled to open the gaming floor and a portion of the hotel rooms in March 2018. MRMI, which operates the Monticello Casino and Raceway, is our sole subsidiary that generates revenues. Consequently, our ability to meet our working capital requirements for fiscal 2017 depends on the earnings and the distribution of funds from our sole operating subsidiary, MRMI. In fiscal 2016, MRMI had operating income of approximately $3.0 million in the current year. While the cash flow generated from our current operations, along with the proceeds of the Term Loan Facility, the Kien Huat Montreign Loan Agreement and the remaining proceeds of the January 2016 Rights Offering, are sufficient to fund our current obligations and the currently expected costs of the Development Projects and service our debt obligations, it is unlikely that MRMI will generate sufficient revenue to make cash distributions in an amount necessary for us to satisfy our working capital requirements or our obligations under any current or future indebtedness. In addition, MRMI or any other subsidiary may enter into contracts that limit or prohibit its ability to make distributions. The Kien Huat Montreign Loan Agreement limits Montreign Holding\u2019s ability to declare dividends or make distributions to Empire in an amount greater than $9 million, which amount can be used for working capital requirements and for purposes of paying taxes. Such limitations may adversely impact our ability to meet our ongoing obligations. Specifically, these limitations on making of distributions may adversely impact the Company\u2019s ability to pay our employees, accounting professionals or legal professionals, all of whom we rely on to manage our operations, ensure regulatory compliance and sustain our public company status.\nIf revenues and operating income from our operations at Monticello Casino and Raceway do not increase, it could adversely affect our financial performance.\nThere can be no assurance that our current operations will draw sufficient patrons to Monticello Casino and Raceway to increase our revenues to the point that we will recognize net income. The operations and placement of our VGMs, including the layout and distribution, are under the jurisdiction of the NYSGC and the program contemplates that a significant share of the responsibility for marketing the program will be borne by the NYSGC. The NYSGC is not required to make decisions that we feel are in our best interest and, as a consequence, the profitability of our VGM operations may not reach the levels that we believe to be feasible or may be slower than expected in reaching those levels. By statute, from April 1, 2008 until March 31, 2017, 41% of gross VGM revenue is distributed to us. Unless the 2017-2018 New York State Budget, which we anticipate will be adopted before March 31, 2017, contains a provision to extend this share percentage of gross VGM revenue to March 31, 2018, effective as of April 1, 2017, only 39% of gross VGM revenue will be distributed to us. No assurance can be given that such revenue will be sufficient to generate a profit or continue to do so. Our operations are subject to many regulatory, competitive, economic and business risks beyond our control, and a change in this regard could have a material adverse impact on our operations and our business prospects.\nGaming is a highly regulated industry and adverse changes or developments in gaming laws or regulations could be\ndifficult to comply with or significantly increase our costs, which could cause our Development Projects to be unsuccessful.\nGaming is a highly regulated industry. Current laws, such as licensing requirements, tax rates and other regulatory\nobligations, including for anti-money laundering, could change or become more stringent resulting in additional regulations\nbeing imposed upon the development and operation of the Casino Project or a further liberalization of competition being introduced in the gaming industry. Any such adverse developments in the regulation of the gaming industry in New York State could be difficult to comply with and significantly increase our costs, which could cause the Development Projects to be unsuccessful.\nChanges in the laws, regulations, and ordinances (including local laws) to which the gaming industry is subject, and the application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations, or our inability or the inability of our subsidiaries, key personnel, significant stockholders, or joint venture partners to obtain or maintain required gaming regulatory licenses, permits or approvals could prevent us from pursuing future development projects or otherwise adversely impact our results of operation.\nThe ownership, management and operation of our current and any future gaming facilities are and will be subject to extensive federal, state, provincial, and/or local laws, regulations and ordinances that are administered by the relevant regulatory agency or agencies in each jurisdiction. These laws, regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally concern the responsibilities, financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations, and often require such parties to obtain certain licenses, permits and approvals. In addition, some of the licenses that we and our subsidiaries, officers, directors and principal stockholders hold expire after a relatively short period and thus require frequent renewals and reevaluations. Obtaining these\nlicenses in the first place and the renewal process involves a subjective determination by the regulatory agencies. If we or our subsidiaries do not obtain and maintain the required licenses, permits and approvals, we may be required to divest our interest in our current or future gaming facilities or our current gaming facility risks losing its licenses. These laws, regulations and ordinances may also affect the operations of our gaming facilities or our plans in pursuing future projects.\nCommercial casino gaming was legalized in New York State in 2013 and regulations implementing the Gaming Act are not fully adopted, which makes it difficult for the Company to assess the impact of these regulations on the Casino Project and other Development Projects.\nThe regulations implementing the Gaming Act are still in development stage and, accordingly, the Company cannot fully assess the rules that will govern the operation and maintenance of the Casino Project and the other Development Projects. Our inability to consider all relevant regulations in the pre-opening stage of our development may lead to unexpected results and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe gaming industry in the northeastern United States is highly competitive, with many of our competitors better known and better financed than us.\nWe primarily compete directly with other casino and VGM facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding market areas. With the completion of the Casino Project and the further opening of the Initial Projects, we expect to also receive patronage from guests residing within a 75- to 120-mile radius, including the New York City metropolitan area, which represents our secondary market. The gaming industry in the northeastern United States is highly competitive and increasingly dominated by multinational corporations or Native American tribes that enjoy widespread name recognition, established brand loyalty, decades of casino operation experience, an array of amenities, high-quality management talent and a diverse portfolio of gaming assets and with substantially greater financial resources.\nMonticello Casino and Raceway faces competition from Yonkers Raceway which is located within the New York City metropolitan area. The Yonkers facility, which is much closer to New York City, has a harness horseracing facility, approximately 5,300 VGMs, food and beverage outlets and other amenities. In contrast, we have more limited financial resources and currently operate our harness horse racing facility and VGMs in Monticello, New York, which is approximately a 90-minute drive from New York City.\nPennsylvania casinos may operate table games and slot machines, have the ability to grant credit to guests of the casino and have the ability to award an unlimited amount of non-taxable free play to their guests, which poses a competitive threat to both the Casino Project and the Monticello Casino and Raceway. Pennsylvania legalized the operation of up to 61,000 slot machines at 14 locations throughout the state. As of March 10, 2017, there were 12 casinos in operation within Pennsylvania, with six located at race tracks. One such racetrack facility is the Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs, which has approximately 2,330 slot machines and 75 table games, including 18 poker tables, and a hotel and spa. The Mohegan Sun at Pocono Downs in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, is approximately 70 miles southwest of Monticello and the Town of Thompson. In addition, the Mount Airy Casino Resort has approximately 1,868 slot machines and 81 table games, including nine poker tables, a hotel, spa, and a golf course. The Mount Airy Casino Resort is located in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, approximately 60 miles southwest of Monticello. The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Commission selected Stadium Casino, LLC to be awarded the 13th license for a casino to be located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Any expansion of these casinos in Pennsylvania will likely increase the degree of competition within our market and may have an adverse effect on our business and future operating performance.\nNo assurance can be given that we will be able to compete successfully for gaming customers with established casinos or the competing VGM facility at Yonkers Raceway.\nIf our competitors operate more successfully than we do, if they attract customers away from us as a result of aggressive pricing and promotion, if they are more successful than us in attracting and retaining employees, if their properties are enhanced or expanded, if they operate in jurisdictions that give them operating advantages due to differences or changes in gaming regulations or taxes, or if additional hotels and casinos are established in and around the locations in which we conduct\nbusiness, we may lose market share or the ability to attract or retain employees. In particular, the expansion of casino gaming in\nor near any geographic area from which we attract or expect to attract a significant number of our customers could have a\nsignificant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our skilled employees and key personnel and the loss of their services would adversely affect our operations and business strategy.\nThe operation of our business requires qualified executives, managers and skilled employees with hospitality, gaming and horse racing industry experience and qualifications to enable such individuals to obtain and maintain the requisite licenses and approvals from the NYSGC. In addition, with respect to our involvement in the Development Projects, we place substantial reliance on the gaming, project development and hospitality industry experience and knowledge of the northeastern United States gaming market possessed by members of our senior management team. If we are unable to maintain our key personnel and attract new skilled employees with high levels of expertise in the gaming areas in which we engage and propose to engage, or are unable to do so without unreasonably increasing our labor costs, the execution of our business strategy may be hindered and our growth limited. We believe that our success is largely dependent on the continued employment of our executive management and the hiring of strategic personnel at reasonable costs. Competition for skilled employees and qualified executives is intense and we can give no assurance that we would be able to hire a qualified replacement with the required level of experience and expertise for any current members of our senior management, if required to do so. Accordingly, if any of our current key executives were unable or unwilling to continue in his or her present position, or we were unable to attract a sufficient number of qualified employees at reasonable rates, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely impacted. Additionally, recruiting and hiring a replacement for any skilled employees or executive management position could divert the attention of other senior management and increase our operating expenses.\nCasinos are subject to Anti-Money Laundering Laws.\nWe deal with significant amounts of cash in the operations and will be subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violation of AML laws or regulations, on which in recent years, governmental authorities have been increasingly focused, with a particular focus on the gaming industry, by any of our properties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn connection with the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility, Montreign Operating was required to obtain credit ratings for its debt offering. Although the maintenance of a certain credit rating is not a condition to the availability of the Term Loan Facility or the Revolving Credit Facility, an adverse change in this credit rating and the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could adversely affect our business. Such ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and any rating could be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant such action. For example, such ratings could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf any of the credit rating agencies that have rated our securities downgrades or lowers its credit rating, or if any credit rating agency indicates that it has placed any such rating on a \"watch list\" for a possible downgrade or lowering, or otherwise indicates that its outlook for that rating is negative, such action could have a material adverse effect on our costs and availability of funding in the future, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, the trading price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations, among other obligations.\nRisks Relating to the Development Projects\nThe Development Projects are capital intensive and, in order to obtain the necessary financing, we have entered into the Term Loan Agreement and the Kien Huat Montreign Loan Agreement, which contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe Development Projects require substantial capital. On January 24, 2017, Montreign Operating entered into the Term Loan Agreement and Montreign Holding entered into the Kien Huat Montreign Loan Agreement, both of which agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business. The Term Loan Agreement and the Kien Huat Montreign Loan Agreement contain a number of covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, including restrictions on our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7 incur additional debt or issue certain shares;\n\u00b7 pay dividends on or make distributions in respect of our common stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u00b7 make certain investments or acquisitions;\n\u00b7 incur or permit liens on certain assets; and\n\u00b7 consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.\nMoreover, to make use of the proceeds of the Term Loan Agreement, Montreign Operating must satisfy the disbursement conditions set forth thereunder, including confirmations that the proceeds will be applied towards the expenses itemized in the Development Projects construction budget submitted to the lenders. If we cannot satisfy the disbursement conditions, Montreign Operating will be unable to utilize the Term Loan Facility, which may require us to curtail or end construction of the Development Projects altogether. As a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs, which may adversely impact our operations.\nDefaults under the Term Loan Agreement, the Revolving Credit Agreement or the Kien Huat Montreign Loan Agreement could result in a substantial loss of our assets.\nWe have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under the Term Loan Agreement, Revolving Credit\nAgreement and the Kien Huat Montreign Loan Agreement. A failure to comply with the covenants contained in any of these\nagreements could result in an event of default thereunder, which, if not cured or waived, could enable the lenders thereunder to\ndeclare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be due and payable and terminate all\ncommitments to extend further credit. The lenders could also elect to foreclose on our assets securing such debt. Such actions\nby the lenders could cause cross defaults under our other indebtedness. In such an event, the Company may not be able to\nrefinance or repay all of its indebtedness, pay dividends or have sufficient liquidity to meet operating and capital expenditure\nrequirements. Any such acceleration could cause us to lose a substantial portion of our assets and will substantially adversely\naffect our ability to continue our operations.\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our\nability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting our obligations.\nAs of the Loan Closing Date, the amount of our total long-term debt was approximately $447 million (with the ability to draw down on the $70 million Term A Loan subject to the conditions of the Term Loan Agreement, which must be met at the time a request to draw on the Term A Loan is made). Our outstanding debt and related debt service obligations could have important adverse consequences to us, including:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow further capital needed to complete the Development Projects, if needed;\n\u2022\nheightening our vulnerability to downturns in our business, industry, or the general economy and restricting us from making improvements or acquisitions, or exploring business opportunities;\n\u2022\nrequiring a significant portion of our available cash to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our use of available cash to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who have greater capital resources.\nThe ability to make payments of principal and interest on indebtedness will depend on the future performance of the Development Projects, which is subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. If sufficient cash flow is not generated from operations to service such debt, we may be required, among other things, to:\n\u2022\nseek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;\n\u2022\ndelay, curtail or abandon altogether our development plans;\n\u2022\nrefinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness; or\n\u2022\nsell selected assets.\nSuch measures might be insufficient to service the indebtedness. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If funds are not available when needed, or available on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some of our obligations with respect to the Development Projects. In addition, we may not be able to grow market share, take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements, which could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nConstruction at the Development Projects is subject to hazards that may cause personal injury or loss of life, thereby subjecting us to liabilities and possible losses, which may not be covered by insurance.\nThe construction of large-scale properties such as the Development Projects can be dangerous. Construction workers at our projects are subject to hazards that may cause personal injury or loss of life, thereby subjecting the contractor and us to liabilities, possible losses, delays in completion of the projects and negative publicity. In the event of such accidents, we may stop construction for several days to allow for safety inspections and investigations. We and our contractors will take safety precautions that are consistent with industry practice, but these safety precautions may not be adequate to prevent serious personal injuries or further loss of life, damage to property or delays. If accidents occur during the construction of Development Projects, we may be subject to delays, including delays imposed by regulators, liabilities and possible losses, which may not be covered by insurance, and our business, prospects and reputation may be materially and adversely affected.\nThe costs associated with the Development Projects may increase due to significant risks inherent in construction projects.\nThe construction of the Development Projects subjects us to significant risks inherent in the construction of a new facility, including unanticipated design, construction, regulatory and environmental problems. The Development Projects could also experience:\n\u2022\nchanges to plans and specifications (some of which may require the approval of the NYSGC);\n\u2022\ndelays and significant cost increases;\n\u2022\nshortages of materials;\n\u2022\nshortages of skilled labor or work stoppages for contractors and subcontractors;\n\u2022\ninability of contractors and subcontractors to obtain and maintain required licenses issued by the NYSGC;\n\u2022\ninability to meet MWBE participation goals;\n\u2022\nlabor disputes or work stoppages;\n\u2022\ndisputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors;\n\u2022\nhealth and safety incidents and site accidents;\n\u2022\nengineering problems, including defective plans and specifications;\n\u2022\npoor performance or nonperformance by any third parties on whom we place reliance;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations, applicable to gaming;\n\u2022\nunforeseen construction scheduling, engineering, environmental, permitting, construction or geological problems;\n\u2022\nenvironmental issues, including the discovery of unknown environmental contamination;\n\u2022\nweather interference, floods, fires or other casualty losses;\n\u2022\nother unanticipated circumstances or cost increases; and\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain necessary licenses, permits, entitlements or other governmental approvals with respect to the Entertainment Village Project and Golf Course Project.\nThe occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs of the Development Projects or delay or prevent the construction or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of the Development Projects, all of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and cause us to require additional external financing.\nIn combination with existing and proposed casinos in New York State and nearby states, the Casino Project will face intense competition that may adversely impact our ability to meet our development goals.\nA number of Native American tribes and gaming entrepreneurs are seeking to develop casinos in New York State and Connecticut in areas that are approximately 90 miles from New York City, such as Bridgeport, Connecticut and Southampton, New York. We are unable to predict when or if laws would be amended to permit such tribes and entrepreneurs to develop casinos in New York State and nearby states. Depending on the size, location and scope and gaming tax rate, if casinos are built in northern New Jersey, they may adversely impact our current operations and the prospects for the Casino Project. Based on proximity, a gaming facility in any of the nearby states, which could include a casino, hotel, restaurants and retail shops, may significantly increase the competition we face and have a material adverse effect on our business operations and future performance.\nNone of the Development Projects have operating history and our projections on the operations of such properties may not serve as an adequate basis to judge our future operating results and prospects.\nThere is no historical information available about the Casino Project, the Entertainment Village Project or the Golf Course Project upon which you can base your evaluation of their respective business plans and prospects. The Development Projects will generate no revenue until the Casino Project is open to the public (which will be the first of the Development Projects open to the public), which is expected to occur in March 2018. As a result, you should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks, expenses and challenges that we will face as a company seeking to develop and operate a major new development project and gaming businesses in a rapidly growing and intensely competitive market.\nWe have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by companies developing a major new project, and those risks and difficulties may be heightened in a rapidly developing market such as the gaming market in the northeastern United States. Some of the risks relate to our ability to:\n\u2022\ncomplete our construction projects within their anticipated time schedules and budgets;\n\u2022\nattract and retain customers and qualified employees;\n\u2022\noperate, support, expand and develop our operations and our facilities;\n\u2022\nmaintain effective control of our operating costs and expenses;\n\u2022\ndevelop and maintain internal personnel, systems and procedures to assure compliance with the extensive regulatory requirements applicable to the gaming business;\n\u2022\nrespond to changes in our regulatory environment; and\n\u2022\nrespond to competitive market conditions.\nIf we are unable to complete any of these tasks, we may be unable to complete and operate the Development Projects in the manner we contemplate and generate revenues in the amounts and by the times we anticipate. We may also be unable to meet the conditions to draw on the Term A Loan in order to fund our development and construction activities. If any of these events were to occur, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEven if the Casino Project, the Entertainment Village Project and the Golf Course Project are completed as planned and opened, they may not be financially successful, which would limit our cash flow and would materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to repay our debt.\nEven if the Casino Project, the Entertainment Village Project and the Golf Course Project are completed as planned and opened, one or more still may not be a financially successful venture or generate the cash flows that we anticipate. We may not attract the level of patronage that we are seeking. If the Casino Project, the Entertainment Village Project or the Golf Course\nProject do not attract sufficient business, this will limit our cash flow and would materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to service payments under our debt agreements.\nNew York State could grant additional Gaming Facility Licenses in our area or in New York City or the surrounding counties earlier than the expected seven-year blackout period, which could significantly increase the already intense competition in the northeastern United States and cause us to lose or be unable to gain market share.\nThe Gaming Act provides for the award of up to four Gaming Facility Licenses in three regions of upstate New York, including our area, and prohibits the issuance of Gaming Facility Licenses in the \u201cdownstate\u201d region, which includes New York City and its surrounding counties. The award of such a Gaming Facility License is intended to be exclusive for a period of seven years commencing on the date of the award. We can provide no assurance that the New York State government will not change this law and issue additional Gaming Facility Licenses before the expiration of this seven-year exclusivity period. If the New York State government were to allow additional competitors to operate in our area or in other regions of New York through the grant of additional Gaming Facility Licenses, we would face additional competition, which could significantly increase the already intense competition in the northeastern United States and cause us to lose or be unable to gain market share.\nOur business depends on a strong brand and if we are not able to build, maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to expand our market will be impaired and our business and operating results will be harmed.\nWe believe that the brand identity that we intend to develop will significantly contribute to the success of our business. We also believe that maintaining and enhancing a brand is critical to expanding our market share. The Board of Directors of Empire and the Board of Managers of Montreign Operating have approved the form of the RW License Agreement, which has been submitted to the NYSGC for review and approval. Building, maintaining and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful. If we fail to promote and maintain our brand, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, operating results and financial condition will be materially adversely affected. We anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult and expensive.\nRisks Relating to our Ownership Structure\nStockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate decisions may be limited because our major stockholder owns a large percentage of our common stock.\nKien Huat is the beneficial holder of 27,533,067 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 88.3% of our voting power as of March 10, 2017. This reflects Kien Huat's participation and backstop of the January 2016 Rights Offering (as defined below) pursuant to the January 2016 Standby Purchase Agreement (as defined below) and the conversion of the convertible promissory note held by Kien Huat pursuant to the terms of a loan agreement dated November 10, 2010, by and between the Company and Kien Huat (the \"2010 Kien Huat Loan Agreement\"). Under the terms of an investment agreement dated November 12, 2009 (the \u201cInvestment Agreement\u201d), between the Company and Kien Huat, if any option or warrant outstanding as of the final closing under the Investment Agreement, or the first 200,000 shares granted to directors or officers who served in such capacity as of the final closing date under the Investment Agreement, are exercised, Kien Huat has the right (following notice of such exercise) to purchase an equal number of additional shares of our common stock as are issued upon such exercise at the exercise price for the applicable option or warrant (such rights the \"Option Matching Rights\"). As of December 31, 2016, Kien Huat had approximately 21,000 Option Matching Rights.\nUnder the terms of the Investment Agreement, Kien Huat is also entitled to recommend three directors candidates whom we are required to cause to be elected or appointed to our Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d), subject to the satisfaction of all legal and governance requirements regarding service as a director and to the reasonable approval of the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee of our Board. Kien Huat will continue to be entitled to recommend three directors candidates for so long as it owns at least 24% of our voting power outstanding at such time, after which the number of directors whom Kien Huat will be entitled to designate for election to our Board will be reduced proportionally to Kien Huat\u2019s percentage of ownership. Under the Investment Agreement, for so long as Kien Huat is entitled to recommend nominees to serve as Board members, among other things, Kien Huat will have the right to nominate one of its director designees to serve as the Chairman of the Board. Emanuel Pearlman has been appointed to serve as Chairman of the Board pursuant to Kien Huat\u2019s recommendation. Until such time as Kien Huat ceases to own capital stock with at least 30% of our voting power outstanding at such time, our Board will be prohibited under the terms of the Investment Agreement from taking certain actions relating to fundamental transactions involving us and our subsidiaries and certain other matters without the affirmative vote of the directors recommended by Kien Huat and elected by shareholders. Consequently, Kien Huat has the ability to exert significant influence\nover our policies and affairs, including the election of our Board and the approval of any action requiring a stockholder vote, such as approving amendments to our certificate of incorporation and mergers or sales of substantially all of our assets, as well as other matters. Although Kien Huat has expressed no interest in doing so, Kien Huat is not restricted from acquiring additional shares of our common stock, including through open market purchases. However, on February 17, 2016, we entered into a letter agreement with Kien Huat (the \"Kien Huat Letter Agreement\"), wherein Kien Huat agreed, for a period of three years from the date of the Kien Huat Letter Agreement, to seek certain approvals of the Board of Directors and minority shareholders in connection with any \"going-private\" transaction. Notwithstanding the Kien Huat Letter Agreement, this concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our Company on terms that other stockholders may desire or force the sale of our company on terms undesirable to other stockholders.\nRisks Relating to the Market Value of Our Common Stock\nThe Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law of New York State requires our stockholders to possess certain qualifications. If the NYSGC believes a stockholder does not meet their subjective determination, a stockholder may be forced to sell any stock they hold and such sale may result in a material loss of investment value for the stockholder.\nThe Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law of New York State requires our stockholders to possess certain qualifications. A failure to possess such qualifications could lead to a material loss of investment by either us or our stockholders, as it would require divestiture of the stockholder\u2019s direct or indirect interest in us. Consequently, should any stockholder ever fail to meet the qualifications necessary to own a direct or indirect interest in us as determined by NYSGC, such stockholder could be forced to liquidate all interests in us. Should such stockholder be forced to liquidate these interests within a relatively short period of time, such stockholder would likely be forced to sell at a discount, causing a material loss of investment value.\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile, leading to the possibility of its value being depressed at a time when our stockholders want to sell their holdings.\nThe market price of our common stock has in the past been, and may in the future continue to be, volatile. For instance, between January 1, 2016 and March 10, 2017, the closing price of our common stock has ranged between $11.38 and $25.19 per share. A variety of events may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly, including, but not necessarily limited to the following:\n\u2022\nquarter-to-quarter variations in operating results;\n\u2022\nday traders;\n\u2022\nadverse or positive news reports or public announcements; and\n\u2022\nmarket conditions for the gaming industry.\nIn addition, the stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of companies, at times for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. These market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock and other interests in the Company at a time when our stockholders want to sell their interest in us.\nIf we fail to meet the applicable continued listing requirements of NASDAQ Global Market, NASDAQ may delist our common stock, in which case the liquidity and market price of our common stock could decline.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NASDAQ Global Market. In order to maintain that listing, we must satisfy certain continued listing requirements. If we are deficient in maintaining the necessary listing requirements, our common stock may be delisted. If our common stock is delisted, an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained and the market price of our common stock could decline.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nDuring the past three fiscal years, we did not declare or pay any cash dividends with respect to our common stock and we do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain all future earnings for use in the development of our business. There can be no assurance that we will have, at any time, sufficient surplus under Delaware law to be able to pay any dividends.\nFuture sales of our common stock by our insiders may cause our stock price to decline.\nA portion of our outstanding shares are held by directors and executive officers and a significant portion of our outstanding shares are held by Kien Huat, our largest stockholder. Resales of a substantial number of shares of our stock by these stockholders, announcements of the proposed resale of substantial amounts of our stock, or the perception that substantial resales may be made by such stockholders could adversely impact the market price of our stock. Some of our directors and executive officers have entered into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans pursuant to which they have arranged to sell shares of our common stock from time to time in the future. Actual or potential sales by these insiders, including those under a pre-arranged Rule 10b5-1 trading plan may adversely impact the market price of our stock.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock in the public market could adversely affect the trading price of shares of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market, including pursuant to the Second Amendment to the Commitment Letter or the effective shelf registration statement, or the perception that such sales are likely to occur could affect the market price of our common stock. Kien Huat\u2019s stock ownership may also discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce our stock price or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over our stock price.\nRisks Relating to our Racing Operations\nThe continuing decline in the popularity of horse racing, decline of the horse population and increasing competition in simulcasting could adversely impact the business of Monticello Casino and Raceway.\nSince the mid-1980s, there has been a general decline in the number of people attending and wagering at live horse races at North American racetracks due to a number of factors, including increased competition from other forms of gaming, unwillingness of guests to travel a significant distance to racetracks and the increasing availability of off-track wagering. The declining attendance at live horse racing events has prompted racetracks to rely increasingly on revenues from inter-track, off-track and account wagering markets. The industry-wide focus on inter-track, off-track and account wagering markets has increased competition among racetracks for outlets to simulcast their live races. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, we generated approximately $2.9 million, $3.3 million and $1.8 million, respectively, of revenues from the import and export simulcasting of out-of-state racing, of which approximately $1.4 million, $1.7 million and $900,000, respectively, were due to the horsemen. A continued decrease in attendance at live events and in on-track wagering, continued decline in the horse population and available drivers, as well as increased competition in the inter-track, off-track and account wagering markets, could lead to a decrease in the amount wagered at Monticello Casino and Raceway. Our business plan anticipates the possibility of Monticello Casino and Raceway attracting new guests to our racetrack wagering operations through VGMs in order to offset the general decline in raceway attendance. However, even if our VGM operations attract new guests to our racetrack, we may not be able to generate profit from operations. Public tastes are unpredictable and subject to change. Any further decline in interest in horse racing or any change in public tastes may adversely affect our revenues and, therefore, limit our ability to make a positive contribution to our results of operation.\nGeneral Business Risks\nInstability and volatility in the financial markets could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe demand for entertainment and leisure activities tends to be highly sensitive to consumers\u2019 disposable income. Discretionary consumer spending habits have been adversely affected by the recent economic conditions and the actual or perceived economic conditions could lead to further decrease in spending by our guests. We cannot predict at what level these negative trends will continue, worsen or improve and the ultimate impact it will have on our future results of operations. The continued weakness in our market and the deterioration of the broader global economy would have a material adverse effect on our industry and our business, including our revenues, profitability, operating results and cash flow.\nMoreover, we may need to raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to finance our plans for growth. We may be unable to incur additional indebtedness in the public or private markets to fund our business strategy on terms we believe to be reasonable, if at all. In addition, the Term Loan Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement may limit our ability to incur debt at all. Moreover, we may be unable to raise capital on terms acceptable to the Company. An inability to obtain the capital we need to finance our growth plans may adverse affect our operations and business prospects.\nWe are subject to greater risks than a geographically diverse company.\nOur operations are limited to the Catskills region of New York State, which has been affected by decades-long decline in economic conditions. As a result, in addition to our susceptibility to adverse global and domestic economic, political and business conditions, any economic downturn in the region could have a material adverse effect on our operations. An economic downturn would likely cause a decline in the disposable income of consumers in the region, which could result in a decrease in the number of patrons at our facility, the frequency of their visits and the average amount that they would be willing to spend at our facility. We are subject to greater risks than more geographically diversified gaming or resort operations, including:\n\u2022\na downturn in national, regional or local economic conditions;\n\u2022\nan increase in competition in New York State or the northeastern United States and Canada, particularly for day-trip patrons residing in New York State, including as a result of any new tribal Class III casinos, destination gaming resorts or VGMs at certain racetracks and other locations in New York State, Connecticut and New Jersey and casinos in Pennsylvania;\n\u2022\nimpeded access due to road construction or closures of primary access routes; and\n\u2022\nadverse weather and natural and other disasters in the northeastern United States.\nThe occurrence of any one of the events described above could cause a material disruption in our business and make us unable to generate sufficient cash flow to make payments on our obligations.\nOur business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results.\nWe are a large consumer of electricity and other energy and, therefore, higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Accordingly, increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on our operating results. Additionally, higher electricity and gasoline prices which affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to Monticello Casino and Raceway and a reduction in our revenues.\nOur business operations have historically been subject to seasonal variations and quarterly fluctuations in operating results, and we can expect to experience such variations and fluctuations in the future.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by weather-related and seasonal factors. Severe winter weather conditions may deter or prevent patrons from reaching our gaming facilities or undertaking day trips. Although our budget assumes these seasonal fluctuations in our gaming revenues to ensure adequate cash flow during expected periods of lower revenues, we cannot ensure that weather-related and seasonal factors will not have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur operations are located at a facility in Monticello, New York and the Development Projects are being developed in the Town of Thompson, New York. Although this area is not prone to earthquakes, floods, tornadoes, fires or other natural disasters, the occurrence of any of these events or any other cause of material disruption in our operation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Moreover, although we do maintain insurance customary for our industry, including a policy with $10 million limit of coverage for the perils of flood and earthquake, we cannot ensure that this coverage will be sufficient in the event of one of the disasters mentioned above.\nWe may be subject to material environmental liability as a result of unknown environmental hazards.\nWe are subject to various federal, New York State and local environmental laws and regulations that govern our operations and the construction of the Development Projects, including emissions and discharges into the environment, and the storage, handling and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous substances and wastes. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in regulatory fines, legal fees and costs for remediation. Such fines and costs could be related to our storage, handling and disposal of waste from our racing operations, the existence of asbestos at Monticello Casino and Raceway and the existence of environmental conditions at the site of the Development Projects, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk including misappropriation of customer information or other breaches of information security.\nWe rely on information technology and other systems to maintain and transmit customers' personal and/or financial information, credit card information, mailing lists and other information. We have taken steps designed to safeguard our customers' personal and financial information and have implemented systems designed to meet all requirements of the Payment Card Industry standards for data protection. However, our information and processes are subject to the ever-changing threat of\ncompromised security, in the form of a risk of potential breach, system failure, computer virus or unauthorized or fraudulent access or use by unauthorized individuals. The steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful, and any resulting compromise or loss of data or systems could adversely impact operations or regulatory compliance and could result in remedial expenses, fines, litigation and loss of reputation, potentially impacting our financial results. Although we have invested in and deployed security systems and developed processes that are designed to protect all sensitive data, prevent data loss and reduce the impact of any security breach, such measures cannot provide absolute security.", "PERMNO": 79790, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "NYNY"}
