While the cycles of each industry do not necessarily coincide, demand and prices in each may drop substantially during the same period. Real estate development of residential lots is further influenced by new home construction activity, which can be volatile. Mineral resources may be further influenced by national and international commodity prices, principally for oil and gas. Cyclical downturns may materially and adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. All of our operations are impacted by both national and global economic conditions.\nThe real estate and mineral resources industries are highly competitive and a number of entities with which we compete are larger and have greater resources, and competitive conditions may adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe real estate and mineral resources industries in which we operate are highly competitive and are affected to varying degrees by supply and demand factors and economic conditions, including changes in interest rates, new housing starts, home repair and remodeling activities, credit availability, consumer confidence, unemployment, housing affordability, changes in commodity prices, and federal energy policies.\nCompetitive conditions in the real estate industry may result in difficulties acquiring suitable land at acceptable prices, lower sales volumes and prices, increased development or construction costs and delays in construction and leasing. We compete with numerous regional and local developers for the acquisition, entitlement, and development of land suitable for development. We also compete with national, regional and local home builders who develop real estate for their own use in homebuilding operations, many of which are larger and have greater resources, including greater marketing budgets. Any improvement in the cost structure or service of our competitors will increase the competition we face.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected by any of these factors.\nWe may be unable to successfully divest our non-core assets at favorable prices or on our target schedule, which could adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows.\nWe have announced that we are focused on our core community development business, and that we intend to exit non-core, non-residential housing assets. The sale of non-core real estate assets may be impacted by market conditions outside of our control, such as capitalization rates, anticipated market demand and job growth, property location and other existing or anticipated competitive properties, interest rates, availability of financing, and other factors that we do not control. Our ability to divest non-core assets, the timing for such divestments, and the prices we may ultimately receive may be impacted by the foregoing or other factors.\nWe may have continuing liabilities relating to non-core assets that have been sold, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nIn the course of selling our non-core assets we are typically required to make contractual representations and warranties and to provide contractual indemnities to the buyers. These contractual obligations typically survive the closing of the transactions for some period of time. If a buyer is successful in sustaining a claim against us we may incur additional expenses pertaining to an asset we no longer own, and we may also be obligated to defend and/or indemnify the buyer from certain third party claims. Such obligations could be material and they could adversely impact our results of operations.\nAny significant reduction in our borrowing base under our senior secured credit facility as a result of the sale of non-core assets may reduce the credit that is available to us under the facility and impact our ability to fund our operations.\nOur senior secured credit facility is secured by some of our assets, and the borrowing base available to us thereunder is derived substantially from valuations associated with the assets pledged. Historically, a substantial portion of the borrowing base was derived from valuations associated with non-core assets, many of which were sold in 2015 and 2016. A portion of the existing borrowing base is also supported by non-core assets that we may market for sale or sell in the near future. Although we have additional assets that have not been but could be pledged to support additional borrowing capacity under our senior secured credit facility, until such time as additional assets are pledged, the reduction of the borrowing base could negatively impact our ability to fund our operations and, as a result may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operation and cash flow.\nRestrictive covenants under our senior secured credit facility and indentures governing our 3.75% convertible senior notes may limit the manner in which we operate.\nOur senior secured credit facility and indentures covering our 3.75% convertible senior notes contain various covenants and conditions that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders;\n\u2022\nrepurchase or redeem capital stock or subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake loans, investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nincur restrictions on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments to us;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with other companies or transfer all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\ntransfer or sell assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries.\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nDespite current indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantially more debt.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 current debt levels, the related risks that we and they now face could intensify.\nWe may be unable to fully realize the benefits of our tax attributes if we experience an ownership change.\nWe have significant deferred tax assets that are generally available to offset future taxable income or income tax. If we experienced an \u201cownership change\u201d under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cSection 382\u201d), Section 382 would impose an annual limit on the amount of our future taxable income that may be reduced by our tax attributes, such as built in losses and other tax attributes (\u201cTax Benefits\u201d), existing prior to the ownership change. In general, an ownership change would occur if our \u201c5-percent shareholders\u201d (as defined in Section 382) collectively increase their ownership in the Company by more than 50 percentage points over their lowest ownership percentage within a rolling three-year period. For these purposes, a 5-percent shareholder is generally any person or group of persons that at any time during the relevant three-year period has owned 5 percent or more of our outstanding common stock. Under Section 382, stock ownership is determined under complex attribution rules and generally includes shares held directly, indirectly (though intervening entities), and constructively (by certain related parties and certain unrelated parties acting as a group). On January 5, 2017, we adopted a Tax Benefits Preservation Plan in order to help protect our tax attributes, such as built-in losses and other tax attributes. Our Tax Benefits Preservation Plan is intended to provide a meaningful deterrent effect against acquisitions of our common stock that could cause the Company to experience an ownership change; however, the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan does not guarantee that the Company will not experience an ownership change. If an ownership change were to occur, our ability to use our Tax Benefits in the future would be limited, which would have a significant negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. The ratification of the extension of the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan to January 5, 2020 is subject to shareholder approval at the Company\u2019s 2017 Annual Meeting. If our shareholders do not approve such extension, the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan will expire on January 5, 2018. Please read Note 21 - Subsequent Events for additional information about the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan.\nThe market price of and trading volume of our shares of common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our shares of common stock has fluctuated substantially and may continue to fluctuate in response to many factors which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our operating results, including results that vary from expectations of management, analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of strategic developments, acquisitions, financings and other material events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock held by existing security holders in the public market; and\n\u2022\ngeneral conditions in the real estate and mineral resources industries.\nThe stock markets in general may experience extreme volatility that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, make it difficult to predict the market price of our common stock in the future and cause the value of our common stock to decline.\nProvisions of Delaware law, our charter documents, the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan and the indentures governing the 3.75% convertible senior notes may impede or discourage a takeover, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In\naddition, our Tax Benefits Preservation Plan could be deemed to have an \u201canti-takeover\u201d effect because, among other things, an Acquiring Person (as defined under the Tax Benefits Preservation Plan) may be diluted upon the occurrence of a triggering event. Our board of directors also has the power, without stockholder approval, to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock. These and other impediments to third party acquisition or change of control could limit the price investors are willing to pay for shares of our common stock, which could in turn reduce the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change under the terms of the convertible senior notes, certain repurchase rights and early settlement rights would be triggered under the indentures governing the convertible senior notes. In such event, the increase of the conversion or early settlement rate, as applicable, in connection with certain make-whole fundamental change transactions under the terms of the convertible senior notes could discourage a potential acquirer.\nOur activities are subject to environmental regulations and liabilities that could have a negative effect on our operating results.\nOur operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment. Compliance with these provisions or the promulgation of new environmental laws and regulations may result in delays, may cause us to invest substantial funds to ensure compliance with applicable environmental regulations and can prohibit or severely restrict timber harvesting, real estate development or mineral production activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas.\nOur business may suffer if we lose key personnel.\nWe depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel. These individuals have extensive experience and expertise in our business segments in which they work. The loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We do not maintain key-man life insurance with respect to any of our employees. Our success will be dependent on our ability to continue to employ and retain skilled personnel in each of our business segments.\nRisks Related to our Real Estate Operations\nReduced demand for new housing or commercial tracts in the markets where we operate could adversely impact our profitability.\nThe residential development industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions, such as employment levels, availability of financing for home buyers, interest rates, consumer confidence and housing demand. Adverse changes in these conditions generally, or in the markets where we operate, could decrease demand for lots for new homes in these areas. Decline in housing demand could negatively affect our real estate development activities, which could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings.\nFurthermore, the market value of undeveloped land and lots held by us, including commercial tracts, can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic and real estate market conditions. If there are significant adverse changes in economic or real estate market conditions, we may have to hold land in inventory longer than planned. Inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses or lower returns and adversely affect our liquidity.\nDevelopment of real estate entails a lengthy, uncertain and costly entitlement process.\nApproval to develop real property entails an extensive entitlement process involving multiple and overlapping regulatory jurisdictions and often requiring discretionary action by local governments. This process is often political, uncertain and may require significant exactions in order to secure approvals. Real estate projects must generally comply with local land development regulations and may need to comply with state and federal regulations. The process to comply with these regulations is usually lengthy and costly, may not result in the approvals we seek, and can be expected to materially affect our real estate development activities, which may adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur real estate development operations are currently concentrated in the major markets of Texas, and as a result, our financial results may be significantly influenced by the Texas economy.\nThe economic growth and strength of Texas, where the majority of our real estate development activity is located, are important factors in sustaining demand for our real estate development activities. The decline in oil prices over the past several years may impact near-term job growth and housing demand in Texas, particularly in Houston, where the energy industry has traditionally generated significant job growth. As a result, any adverse impact to the economic growth and health, or infrastructure development, of Texas could materially adversely affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur real estate development operations are highly dependent upon national, regional and local home builders.\nWe are highly dependent upon our relationships with national, regional, and local home builders to purchase lots in our residential developments. If home builders do not view our developments as desirable locations for homebuilding operations, or if home builders are limited in their ability to conduct operations due to economic conditions, our business, liquidity,\nfinancial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we enter into contracts to sell lots to home builders. A home builder could decide to delay purchases of lots in one or more of our developments due to adverse real estate conditions wholly unrelated to our areas of operations, such as the corporate decisions regarding allocation of limited capital or human resources. As a result, we may sell fewer lots and may have lower sales revenues, which could have an adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur strategic partners may have interests that differ from ours and may take actions that adversely affect us.\nWe enter into strategic alliances or venture relationships as part of our overall strategy for particular developments or regions. While these partners may bring development experience, industry expertise, financing capabilities, local credibility or other competitive attributes, they may also have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours or that are influenced by factors unrelated to our business. We may also be subject to adverse business consequences if the market reputation or financial condition of a partner deteriorates, or if a partner takes actions inconsistent with our interest.\nWhen we enter into a venture, we may rely on our venture partner to fund its share of capital commitments to the venture and to otherwise fulfill its operating and financial obligations. Failure of a venture partner to timely satisfy its funding or other obligations to the venture could require us to elect whether to increase our financial or other operating support of the venture in order to preserve our investment, which may reduce our returns or cause us to incur losses, or to not fund such obligations, which may subject the venture and us to adverse consequences or increase our financial exposure in the project.\nDebt within some of our ventures may not be renewed or may be difficult or more expensive to replace.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our unconsolidated ventures had approximately $128.3 million of debt, of which $78.6 million was non-recourse to us. When debt within our ventures matures, some of our ventures may be unable to renew existing loans or secure replacement financing, or replacement financing may be more expensive. If our ventures are unable to renew existing loans or secure replacement financing, we may be required to contribute additional equity or elect to loan or contribute funds to our ventures, which could increase our risk or increase our borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, or both. If our ventures secure replacement financing that is more expensive, our profits may be reduced.\nDelays or failures by governmental authorities to take expected actions could reduce our returns or cause us to incur losses on certain real estate development projects.\nFor certain projects, we rely on governmental utility and special improvement districts to issue bonds to reimburse us for qualified expenses, such as road and utility infrastructure costs. Bonds must be supported by district tax revenues, usually from ad valorem taxes. Slowing new home sales, decreasing real estate prices or difficult credit markets for bond sales can reduce or delay district bond sale revenues, causing such districts to delay reimbursement of our qualified expenses. Failure to receive timely reimbursement for qualified expenses could adversely affect our cash flows and reduce our returns or cause us to incur losses on certain real estate development projects.\nFailure to succeed in new markets may limit our growth.\nWe may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise. Our historical experience in existing markets does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets. We may be exposed to a variety of risks if we choose to enter new markets, including, among others:\n\u2022\nan inability to accurately evaluate local housing market conditions and local economies;\n\u2022\nan inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities;\n\u2022\nan inability to hire and retain key personnel;\n\u2022\nan inability to successfully integrate operations; and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures.\nRisks Related to our Mineral Resources Operations\nWe do not operate any properties, and have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate.\nThe properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve third-party working interest owners. As a result, we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties, including compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties. Decisions by other parties may significantly influence the revenues we receive from our mineral resources.\nVolatile oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nOur cash flows and results of operations are dependent in part on oil and natural gas prices, which can be volatile. Any substantial or extended decline in the price of oil and natural gas could have a negative impact on our business operations and future revenues. Moreover, oil and natural gas prices depend on factors we cannot control, such as: changes in foreign and\ndomestic supply and demand for oil and natural gas; actions by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; weather; political conditions in other oil-producing countries, including the possibility of insurgency or war in such areas; prices of foreign exports; domestic and international drilling activity; price and availability of alternate fuel sources; the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other major currencies; the level and effect of trading in commodity markets, the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures, and governmental regulations.\nThe ability to sell and deliver oil and natural gas produced from wells on our mineral interests could be materially and adversely affected if adequate gathering, processing, compression and transportation services are not obtained.\nThe sale of oil and natural gas produced from wells on our mineral interests depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability, proximity and capacity of, and costs associated with, gathering, processing, compression and transportation facilities owned by third parties. These facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions, mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions, and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable, if at all. Any significant change in market or other conditions affecting these facilities or the availability of these facilities, including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities on terms acceptable to us or at all, could materially and adversely affect our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reserves and production will decline from their current levels.\nThe rate of production from oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are produced. Our reserves will decline as they are produced which could materially and adversely affect our future cash flow and results of operations.\nA portion of our oil and natural gas production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us.\nA portion of oil and natural gas production from our minerals may be interrupted, or shut in, from time to time for various reasons, including as a result of accidents, weather conditions, loss of gathering, processing, compression or transportation facility access or field labor issues, or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as oil and natural gas prices that we deem uneconomic. If a substantial amount of production is interrupted, our cash flow and, in turn, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWeather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us.\nDemand for natural gas is, to a significant degree, dependent on weather and climate, which impacts, among other things, the price we receive for the commodities produced from wells on our mineral interests and, in turn, our cash flow and results of operations. For example, relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas (as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses) and, as a result, relatively lower prices for natural gas production.\nOur estimated proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex involving decisions and assumptions in evaluating the available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. Accordingly, these estimates are imprecise. Actual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves might vary from those estimated. Any variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of proved developed reserves. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history, development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThe standardized measure of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated reserves. Any material inaccuracies in reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nAs required by SEC regulations, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs in effect at the time of the estimate. However, actual future net cash flows from our properties will be affected by numerous factors not subject to our control.\nThe timing of production will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves, and thus their actual present value. In addition, the 10% discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flow, which is required by the SEC, may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general. Any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nA significant portion of our Louisiana owned net mineral acres are subject to prescription of non-use under Louisiana law.\nA significant portion of our Louisiana owned net mineral acres were severed from surface ownership and retained by creation of one or more mineral servitudes shortly before our 2007 spin-off. Under Louisiana law, a mineral servitude that is not producing minerals or which has not been the subject of good-faith drilling operations will cease to burden the property upon the tenth anniversary of the date of its creation. Upon such event, the mineral rights effectively will revert to the surface owner and we will no longer own the right to lease, explore for or produce minerals from such acreage. The total number of net acres subject to prescription can fluctuate based on oil and gas development and production activities. Some or all of approximately 70,000 of our Louisiana net acres may revert to the surface owner unless drilling operations or production activities commences prior to October 2017.\nRisks Related to our Other Operations\nOur water interests may require governmental permits, the consent of third parties and/or completion of significant transportation infrastructure prior to commercialization, all of which are dependent on the actions of others.\nMany jurisdictions require governmental permits to withdraw and transport water for commercial uses, the granting of which may be subject to discretionary determinations by such jurisdictions regarding necessity. In addition, we do not own the executory rights related to our non-participating royalty interest, and as a result, third-party consent from the executor rights owner(s) would be required prior to production. The process to obtain permits can be lengthy, and governmental jurisdictions or third parties from whom we seek permits or consent may not provide the approvals we seek. We may be unable to secure buyers at commercially economic prices for water that we have a right to extract and transport, and transportation infrastructure across property not owned or controlled by us is required for transport of water prior to commercial use. Such infrastructure can require significant capital and may also require the consent of third parties. We may not have cost effective means to transport water from property we own, lease or manage to buyers. As a result, we may lose some or all of our investment in water assets, or our returns may be diminished.", "PERMNO": 92478, "SIC": 6552, "TIC": "FOR"}
