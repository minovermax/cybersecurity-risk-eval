The material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. If any of the following risks actually occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in local economic conditions may affect our business.\nOur current market area is principally located in Cheshire, Hillsborough, Grafton, Merrimack and Sullivan counties in central and western New Hampshire and in Rutland and Windsor counties in Vermont. Future growth opportunities depend on the growth and stability of the regional economy and our ability to expand our market area. A downturn in the local economy may limit funds available for deposit and may negatively affect borrowers\u2019 ability to repay their loans on a timely basis, both of which could have an impact on our profitability and business.\nIncreases to the allowance for loan losses may cause our earnings to decrease.\nOur business is subject to periodic fluctuations based on national and local economic conditions. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled and may have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial condition. The current economic uncertainty will more than likely affect employment levels and could impact the ability of our borrowers to service their debt. Bank regulatory agencies also periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, we may need, depending on an analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, additional provisions to increase the allowance for loan losses. Any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and, possibly, capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may suffer higher loan losses as a result of these factors and the resulting impact on our borrowers.\nChanges in interest rates and spreads could have an impact on earnings and results of operations.\nOur consolidated earnings and financial condition are dependent to a large degree upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned from loans and investments and interest paid on deposits and borrowings. The narrowing of interest rate spreads could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition. We cannot predict with certainty or control changes in interest rates. Regional and local economic conditions and the policies of regulatory authorities, including monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, affect interest income and interest expense. While we have ongoing policies and procedures designed to manage the risks associated with changes in market interest rates, changes in interest rates still may have an adverse effect on our profitability. For example, high interest rates could affect the amount of loans that we can originate, because higher rates could cause customers to apply for fewer mortgages, or cause depositors to shift funds from accounts that have a comparatively lower cost to accounts with a higher cost, or experience customer attrition due to competitor pricing. If the cost of interest-bearing deposits increases at a rate greater than the yields on interest-earning assets increase, net interest income will be negatively affected. Changes in the asset and liability mix may also affect net interest income. Similarly, lower interest rates cause higher yielding assets to prepay and floating or adjustable rate assets to reset to lower rates. If we are not able to reduce our funding costs sufficiently, due to either competitive factors or the maturity schedule of existing liabilities, then our net interest margin will decline.\nStrong competition within our industry and market area could limit our growth and profitability.\nWe face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of different competitors. Future growth and success will depend on the ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive environment. We compete for deposits, loans and other financial services with a variety of banks, thrifts, credit unions and other financial institutions as well as other entities which provide financial services. Some of the financial institutions and financial services organizations with which we compete are not subject to the same degree of regulation. Many competitors have been in business for many years, have established customer bases, are larger, and have substantially higher lending limits. The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. These technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision, which may interfere with our ability to conduct our business and may negatively impact our financial results.\nWe, primarily through the Bank and certain non-bank subsidiaries, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not stockholders. These regulations affect our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject us to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products, and/or limit pricing able to be charged on certain banking services, among other things. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act has and will continue to change the current bank regulatory structure and affect the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. In addition to the self-implementing provisions of the statute, the Dodd-Frank Act calls for many administrative rulemakings by various federal agencies to implement various parts of the legislation, some of which have yet to be implemented. We cannot be certain when final rules affecting us will be issued through such rulemakings and what the specific content of such rules will be. The financial reform legislation and any implementing rules that are ultimately issued could have adverse implications on the financial industry, the competitive environment, and our ability to conduct business. We will have to apply resources to ensure that we are in compliance with all applicable provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and any implementing rules, which may increase our costs of operations and adversely impact our earnings. Additionally, revised capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action rules applicable to us became effective January 1, 2015. Compliance with these rules will impose additional costs.\nFailure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur.\nWe may be subject to more stringent capital requirements.\nThe Company and the Bank are each subject to capital adequacy guidelines and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital which each of the Company and the Bank must maintain. From time to time, the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy guidelines. If we fail to meet these minimum capital guidelines and other regulatory requirements, our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected. In light of proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements contained in the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulatory accords on international banking institutions formulated by the Basel Committee and implemented by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, we may be required to satisfy additional, more stringent, capital adequacy standards. The ultimate impact of the new capital and liquidity standards on us cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors, including the treatment\nand implementation by the U.S. banking regulators. These requirements, however, and any other new regulations, could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, or could require us to reduce business levels or to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on dividends from the Bank for most of our revenue.\nWe receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from the Bank. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common stock and interest and principal on our debt. Federal laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to us. Also, our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary\u2019s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary\u2019s creditors. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to us, we may not be able to service debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on our preferred or common stock. The inability to receive dividends from the Bank could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe securities purchase agreement between us and the U.S. Department of Treasury in connection with our participation in the Small Business Lending Fund program limits our ability to pay dividends on and repurchase our common stock.\nUnder the terms of our Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B, par value $0.01 per preferred share (the \u201cSeries B Preferred Stock\u201d) issued under the Small Business Lending Fund (\u201cSBLF\u201d) program, our ability to declare or pay dividends or distributions on, or purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire for consideration, shares of common stock is subject to restrictions. No repurchases of common stock may be effected, and no dividends may be declared or paid on the common stock during the current quarter and for the next three quarters following the failure to declare and pay dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock.\nUnder the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, we may only declare and pay a dividend on the common stock, or repurchase shares of any such class or series of stock, if, after payment of such dividend, the dollar amount of our Tier 1 capital would be at least 90% of the Signing Date Tier 1 Capital, as set forth in the Certificate of Designation relating to the Series B Preferred Stock, excluding any subsequent net charge-offs and any redemption of the Series B Preferred Stock (the \u201cTier 1 Dividend Threshold\u201d). The Tier 1 Dividend Threshold is subject to reduction, beginning on the second anniversary of issuance and ending on the 10th anniversary, by 10% for each one percent increase in small business lending that qualifies over the baseline level.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $8 million of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding under the SBLF program.\nWe depend on our executive officers and key personnel to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nManagement believes that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part upon the skills of the management team. The competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry is intense, and the loss of key personnel or an inability to continue to attract, retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect the business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain existing key personnel or attract additional qualified personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers and key personnel could impair our ability to continue to develop our business strategy.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business.\nManagement regularly reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives\nof the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe risks presented by acquisitions could adversely affect our financial condition and result of operations.\nOur business strategy has included and may continue to include growth through acquisition from time to time. Any future acquisitions will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions. These risks may include, among other things: our ability to realize anticipated cost savings, the difficulty of integrating operations and personnel, the loss of key employees, the potential disruption of our or the acquired company\u2019s ongoing business in such a way that could result in decreased revenues, the inability of our management to maximize our financial and strategic position, the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and the impairment of relationships with the acquired company\u2019s employees and customers as a result of changes in ownership and management.\nA breach of information security, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our business and impact our earnings.\nWe depend upon data processing, communication and information exchange on a variety of computing platforms and networks, and over the internet. In addition, we rely on the services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs. Despite existing safeguards, we cannot be certain that all of our systems are free from vulnerability to attack or other technological difficulties or failures. If information security is breached or difficulties or failures occur, despite the controls we and our third-party vendors have instituted, information can be lost or misappropriated, resulting in financial loss or costs to us, reputational harm or damages to others. Such costs or losses could exceed the amount of insurance coverage, if any, which would adversely affect our earnings.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks. A failure to successfully manage these risks may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time to time, we may implement new lines of business, offer new products and services within existing lines of business or shift focus on our asset mix. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services and/or shifting focus of asset mix, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law and certain banking laws, could delay or prevent a takeover of us by a third party.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, the corporate law of the State of Delaware and state and federal banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements, could delay, defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us, despite the possible benefit to our stockholders, or otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock. These provisions include: supermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations; the election of directors to staggered terms of three years; and advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our Board of Directors and for\nproposing matters that stockholders may act on at stockholder meetings. In addition, we are subject to Delaware law, which among other things prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested stockholder unless certain conditions are met. These provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts, discouraging bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors other than candidates nominated by our Board of Directors.", "PERMNO": 10297, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "LSBG"}
