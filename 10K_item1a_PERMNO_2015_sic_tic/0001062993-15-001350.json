{"cik": "1162324", "company": "URANERZ ENERGY CORP.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nStockholders should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below.\nOur failure to successfully address the risks and uncertainties described below would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely. We cannot assure you that we will successfully address these risks or other unknown risks that may affect our business.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nThe pending merger with Energy Fuels is not guaranteed to occur. If the Merger does not occur, it could have a material and adverse effect on our business, growth, revenue, liquidity and results of operations and our share price could be negatively impacted.\nCompletion of the Merger is conditioned upon the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including the approval of the Merger by our shareholders, as set forth in the Merger Agreement. The required conditions to closing may not be satisfied in a timely manner, if at all, or, if permissible, waived. If the Merger is not consummated for these or any other reasons, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and will be subject to a number of risks and consequences, including the following:\nwe may be required, under certain circumstances, to pay Energy Fuels a termination fee of $5.0 million;\nwe must pay the substantial fees and expenses that we incurred related to the Merger, such as legal and accounting fees and expenses, even if the Merger is not completed and we may not be able to recover such fees and expenses from Energy Fuels;\nunder the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completing the Merger, which restrictions could adversely affect our ability to realize certain of our business strategies, including our ability to enter into additional acquisitions or other strategic transactions;\nmatters relating to the Merger may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us;\nthe market price of our common shares may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Merger will be completed; and\nwe may experience negative reactions to the termination of the Merger from customers, clients, business partners, lenders and employees.\nIn addition, any delay in the consummation of the Merger, or any uncertainty about the consummation of the Merger, may adversely affect our future business, growth, revenue, liquidity and results of operations.\nCompliance with the terms of the Merger Agreement in the interim could adversely affect our business.\nAs a result of the pending Merger: (a) the attention of management and employees has been and will continue to be diverted from day-to-day operations as they focus on matters relating to obtaining government approvals required for the Merger and preparation for integrating our operations with those of Energy Fuels; (b) the restrictions and limitations on the conduct of our business pending the Merger have and will continue to disrupt or otherwise adversely affect our business, and may not be in the best interests of us if we were to have to act as an independent entity following a termination of the Merger Agreement; (c) our ability to retain existing employees may be adversely affected due to the uncertainties created by the Merger; and (d) our ability to maintain existing programs, or to establish new ones, may be adversely affected. Any delay in consummating the Merger may exacerbate these issues.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential competing acquirer of us.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that, subject to limited exceptions, restrict our ability to solicit, encourage, facilitate or discuss competing third-party proposals to acquire shares or assets of us. In addition, certain shareholders holding approximately 4.0% of our issued and outstanding shares have entered into support agreements with Energy Fuels pursuant to which they have agreed to vote in favor of the Merger. These provisions and the support agreements could discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Uranerz from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher per share, cash or market value than the Merger consideration proposed to be received or realized in the Merger, or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower price than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the $5.0 million termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated by us, we may not be able to negotiate a transaction with another party on terms comparable to, or better than, the terms of the Merger.\nThe consummation of the merger between us and Energy Fuels could affect the value of your investment in us.\nPursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the Merger our shareholders will exchange their shares of our common stock for shares of Energy Fuels common stock. There are a number of additional risks related to the Merger (including any failure to complete the Merger), the potential combined company following the Merger and the business of Energy Fuels that may affect your investment in us or the potential combined company. These risks include, without limitation, the following:\nthe exchange ratio will not be adjusted in the event of any change in either our stock price or Energy Fuels\u2019 stock price;\nbecause the Merger will be completed after the date of the special meeting, at the time of our special meeting, the exact market value of the Energy Fuels common shares that our shareholders will receive upon completion of the Merger could be higher or lower than the market value at the time of the special meeting;\nthe Merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the receipt of consents and clearances from regulatory authorities that may not be obtained, may not be completed on a timely basis or may impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on us or Energy Fuels;\nas the Merger does not qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code and is otherwise taxable to U.S. holders of our common stock, shareholders may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes as a result of completion of the Merger;\nthe rights of our shareholders who become Energy Fuels shareholders in the Merger will be governed by the Ontario Business Corporations Act (\u201cOBCA\u201d) and subject to Energy Fuels\u2019 articles of incorporation and Energy Fuels\u2019 bylaws;\nthe market price of Energy Fuels\u2019 common shares has been, and may continue to be, volatile;\nour current shareholders will have reduced ownership and voting interests after the Merger;\nthe Merger will result in changes to Energy Fuels\u2019 board of directors and management that may affect the strategy and operations of the combined company as compared to that of us and Energy Fuels as they currently exist;\nany delay in completing the Merger may reduce or eliminate the benefits expected to be achieved thereunder;\nuncertainties associated with the Merger may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees which could adversely affect the future business and operations following the Merger;\nthe expected benefits of the Merger may not be realized;\nthe obligations and liabilities of Energy Fuels, some of which may be unanticipated or unknown, may be greater than anticipated, which may diminish the value of Energy Fuels\u2019 common shares;\nUranerz and Energy Fuels expect to incur substantial expenses related to the Merger and the integration of the two companies;\nUranerz and Energy Fuels may be unable to integrate their respective businesses successfully;\nEnergy Fuels\u2019 future results will suffer if it does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the Merger;\nthe Merger may result in a loss of customers, clients and strategic alliances;\nthe market price of Energy Fuels\u2019 common shares after the consummation of the Merger may be affected by factors different from those affecting Energy Fuels\u2019 common shares or our common stock prior to consummation of the Merger;\nholders of Energy Fuels convertible notes may not agree with Energy Fuel\u2019s position that completion of the Merger will not trigger any right to cause Energy Fuels to redeem their convertible notes; and\nthird parties may terminate or alter existing contracts with us and Energy Fuels.\nLawsuits have been filed against us, Energy Fuels, and Merger Sub relating to the Merger and an adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may prevent the Merger from being completed.\nSince the Merger was announced on January 5, 2015, we, certain of our officers, directors and shareholders, Energy Fuels and Merger Sub have been named as defendants in one or more of the purported shareholder class actions filed in the District Court, Clark County, Nevada and the District Court, Washoe County, Nevada, by certain of our shareholders challenging the proposed Merger and seeking damages. The actions seek, among other things, to enjoin the defendants from completing the Merger on the agreed upon terms. We believe the lawsuits to be without merit and intend to vigorously defend against the actions. However, if the plaintiffs are successful in preventing the Merger, or are awarded significant damages, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity and the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur future performance is difficult to evaluate because we have a limited operating history.\nWe were incorporated in 1999 and we began to implement our current business strategy in the uranium industry in the beginning of 2005 and we realized our initial revenues in 2014. Our operating cash flow needs have been financed primarily through issuances of our common stock and not through cash flows derived from our operations. As a result, we have little historical financial and operating information available to help you evaluate our performance.\nBecause the probability of an individual prospect ever having reserves is not known, our properties may not contain any reserves, and any funds spent on exploration may be lost.\nWe have no reserves as defined by SEC Industry Guide 7 and only recently commenced generating revenue from our operations. Because the probability of an individual prospect ever having reserves is uncertain, our properties may not contain any reserves, and any funds spent on exploration may be lost. We do not know with certainty that economically recoverable uranium exists on any of our properties. Further, although we have commenced uranium extraction activities at our Nichols Ranch Unit, our lack of established reserves means that we are uncertain as to our ability to continue to generate revenue from our operations. We have not to date and we may never complete a feasibility study on any of other properties and any identified deposit may never qualify as a commercially mineable (or viable) reserve. We will continue to attempt to acquire the surface and mineral rights on lands that we think are geologically favorable or where we have historical information in our possession that indicates uranium mineralization might be present.\nThe exploration and, if warranted, development of mineral deposits involves significant financial and other risks over an extended period of time, which even a combination of careful evaluation, experience and knowledge may not eliminate. Few properties which are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines. Major expenditures are required to establish reserves by drilling and to construct mining and processing facilities at a site. Our uranium properties are all at the exploration stage and do not contain any reserves at this time. It is impossible to ensure that the current or proposed exploration programs on properties in which we have an interest will result in the delineation of mineral reserves or in profitable commercial operations. Our operations are subject to the hazards and risks normally incident to exploration and production of uranium, precious and base metals, any of which could result in damage to life or property, environmental damage and possible legal liability for such damage. While we may obtain insurance against certain risks, the nature of these risks is such that liabilities could exceed policy limits or could be excluded from coverage. There are also risks against which we cannot insure or against which we may elect not to insure. The potential costs which could be associated with any liabilities not covered by insurance, or in excess of insurance coverage, or compliance with applicable laws and regulations may cause substantial delays and require significant capital outlays, adversely affecting our future earnings and competitive position and, potentially our financial viability.\nWe have losses which may continue into the future. As a result, we may have to suspend or cease exploration activities.\nWe were incorporated in 1999 and are engaged in the business of mineral exploration. We have incurred losses since inception. We have a relatively limited exploration history upon which an evaluation of our future success or failure can be made. Our ability to achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon:\nour ability to locate a profitable mineral property;\nour ability to obtain favorable prices for the uranium we extract;\nour ability to continue to generate revenues; and\nour ability to control costs.\nBased upon current plans and markets, we expect to incur operating losses in future periods. This will happen because of low market prices for uranium and there are expenses associated with the exploration and exploitation of our mineral properties plus processing costs to produce saleable uranium. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in continuing to generate revenues in the future. Failure to continue to generate revenues and positive cash flows may cause us to suspend or cease our exploration activities.\nOur past extraction operations are limited and may not be indicative of our future extraction results.\nWhile we began extraction activities in 2014 and have started to receive revenues from extraction operations, our results to date are limited. We may encounter issues in the future that results in our extraction activities varying from our past results. These risks include unanticipated variances in the uranium mineralization at our projects, unexpected mechanical and system failures with our in situ extraction operations, including failures with drill holes, water lines, pumps and processing facilities, unexpected shortages in necessary operating materials or equipment, accidents, power outages, water shortages, unexpected issues with obtaining and maintaining our operating permits and other required licenses, labor and employment issues, changes in government regulations and other unanticipated issues which could cause our results to vary in the future. If our extraction operations are not successful in the future, we may have to cease such operations, which would eliminate our revenue generating activities and potentially cause us to reduce or stop our extraction activities.\nBecause some of our officers and directors do not have technical training or experience in exploring for, starting, and operating a mine, we may have to hire qualified personnel. If we can\u2019t locate qualified personnel, we may have to suspend or cease exploration activity.\nSome, but not all, of our officers and directors have experience with exploring for, starting, and operating a mine. Because some of our officers and directors are inexperienced with exploring for, starting, and operating a mine, we may have to hire qualified persons to perform surveying, exploration, and water management of our properties. Some of our officers and directors have no direct training or experience in these areas and as a result may not be fully aware of many of the specific requirements related to working within the industry. Their decisions and choices would typically take into account standard engineering or managerial approaches mineral exploration companies commonly use. However, our exploration activities, earnings and ultimate financial success could suffer irreparable harm due to certain of management\u2019s decisions. As a result we may have to suspend or cease exploration activities, or any future warranted activities.\nOur future profitability will be dependent on uranium prices.\nSince our revenues are expected to be derived from the sale of uranium, our net earnings, if any, can be affected by the long- and short-term market price of yellowcake (U3O8). Uranium prices are subject to fluctuation. The price of uranium has been and will continue to be affected by numerous factors beyond our control. With respect to uranium, such factors include the demand for nuclear power, political and economic conditions in uranium producing and consuming countries, uranium supply from secondary sources, uranium production levels and costs of production. Spot prices for U3O8 were at $20.00 per pound U3O8 in December 2004, and then increased to $35.25 per pound in December 2005 and $72.00 per pound in December 2006. During 2007 the spot price reached a high of $138.00 per pound. The spot price of U3O8 was approximately $90.00 per pound in December 2007. The spot price declined during 2008, reaching a low of $44.00 per pound in October. In 2009, the spot price of U3O8 had a high of $51.50 and a low of $42.00. In 2010, the spot price had a high of $62.50 and a low of $40.75. In 2011, the spot price had a high of $74.00 and a low of $48.00. In 2012, the spot price had a high of $52.50 and a low of $40.75. In 2013, the spot price reached a high of $44.00 and a low of $34.00. In 2014, the spot price had a high of $40.00 and a low of $28.00. The spot price of U3O8 was approximately $35.75 per pound and the long term price was approximately $49.50 per pound at the end of December 2014.\nPublic acceptance of nuclear energy is uncertain.\nThe demand for uranium as a source of energy and growth in that demand is dependent on society\u2019s acceptance of nuclear technology as a means of generating electricity. A major incident at a nuclear power plant anywhere in the world, such as that which occurred at Japan\u2019s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station in March of 2011 following a major earthquake and tsunami, or an accident relating to the transportation of new or spent nuclear fuel, could negatively impact the continuing public acceptance of nuclear energy and the future prospects for nuclear power generation, which may have a material adverse effect on the nuclear industry and the results of our operations and revenues.\nOur operations are subject to environmental regulation and environmental risks.\nWe are required to comply with applicable environmental protection laws and regulations and permitting requirements, and we anticipate that we will be required to continue to do so in the future. The material laws and regulations within the U.S. that we must comply with are the National Environmental Protection Act (\u201cNEPA\u201d), Atomic Energy Act, Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978 (\u201cUMTRCA\u201d), Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Federal Land Policy Management Act, National Park System Mining Regulations Act, and the State Mined Land Reclamation Acts or State Department of Environmental Quality regulations, as applicable. We are required to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, as amended by UMTRCA, by applying for and maintaining a Source Material license from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Uranium operations must conform to the terms of such license, which include provisions for protection of human health and the environment from endangerment due to radioactive materials. The license encompasses protective measures consistent with the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. We intend to utilize specific employees and consultants in order to comply with and maintain our compliance with the above laws and regulations.\nThe uranium industry is subject not only to the worker health and safety and environmental risks associated with all mining businesses, but also to additional risks uniquely associated with uranium mining and processing. The possibility of more stringent regulations exists in the areas of worker health and safety, the disposition of wastes, the decommissioning and reclamation of exploration and in-situ recovery mining sites, and other environmental matters, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the costs or the viability of a particular project. We cannot predict what environmental legislation, regulation or policy will be enacted or adopted in the future or how future laws and regulations will be administered or interpreted. The recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation, generally, is toward stricter standards and this trend is likely to continue in the future. This recent trend includes, without limitation, laws and regulations relating to air and water quality, mine reclamation, waste handling and disposal, the protection of certain species and the preservation of certain lands. These regulations may require the acquisition of permits or other authorizations for certain activities. These laws and regulations may also limit or prohibit activities on certain lands. Compliance with more stringent laws and regulations, as well as potentially more vigorous enforcement policies or stricter interpretation of existing laws, may necessitate significant capital outlays, may materially affect our results of operations and business, or may cause material changes or delays in our intended activities.\nOur operations may require additional analysis in the future including environmental and social impact and other related studies. Certain activities require the submission and approval of environmental impact assessments. Environmental assessments of proposed projects carry a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and directors, officers, and employees. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain all necessary permits that may be required to continue operations or exploration of properties or, if feasible, to commence construction and operation of mining facilities at such properties at economically justifiable costs.\nWe intend to extract uranium from our properties using the in-situ recovery mining process which may not be successful.\nWe intend to extract uranium from our properties using in-situ recovery mining, which is suitable for extraction of certain types of uranium deposits. This process requires in-situ recovery mining equipment and trained personnel. Competition and unforeseen limited sources of supplies in the industry could result in occasional spot shortages of supplies, and certain equipment such as drilling rigs and other equipment that we might need to conduct exploration and, if warranted, development. We will attempt to locate additional products, equipment and materials as needed. If we cannot find the products and equipment we need, we will have to suspend our exploration and, if warranted, development plans until we do find the products and equipment we need.\nWe face risks related to exploration and mine construction, if warranted, on our properties.\nOur level of profitability, if any, in future years will depend to a great degree on uranium prices and whether any of our exploration stage properties can be brought into production. The exploration for and development of mineral deposits involves significant risks. It is impossible to ensure that the current and future exploration programs and/or feasibility studies on our existing properties will establish reserves. Whether a uranium ore body will be commercially viable depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: the particular attributes of the deposit, such as size, grade and proximity to infrastructure; uranium prices, which cannot be predicted and which have been highly volatile in the past; mining, processing and transportation costs; perceived levels of political risk and the willingness of lenders and investors to provide project financing; labor costs and possible labor strikes; and governmental regulations, including, without limitation, regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting materials, foreign exchange, environmental protection, employment, worker safety, transportation, and reclamation and closure obligations.\nWe are subject to the risks normally encountered in the mining industry, such as:\nthe discovery of unusual or unexpected geological formations;\naccidental fires, floods, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and other natural disasters;\nunplanned power outages and water shortages;\ncontrolling water and other similar mining hazards;\noperating labor disruptions and labor disputes;\nthe ability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment, or labor;\nour liability for pollution or other hazards; and\nother known and unknown risks involved in the conduct of exploration, the operation of mines and the market for uranium.\nThe development of mineral properties is affected by many factors, including, but not limited to: the cost of operations; variations in the grade of ore; fluctuations in metal markets; costs of extraction and processing equipment; availability of equipment and labor; labor costs and possible labor strikes; government regulations, including without limitation, regulations relating to taxes, royalties, allowable production, importing and exporting of minerals; foreign exchange; employment; worker safety; transportation; and environmental protection. Depending on the price of uranium, we may determine that it is impractical to continue operation of our Nichols Ranch project. Such a decision would negatively affect our results of operations and our financial condition.\nBecause we may be unable to meet property payment obligations or be unable to acquire or maintain necessary mining licenses and leases, we may lose interests in our exploration properties.\nThe agreements pursuant to which we acquired our interests in some of our properties provide that we must make a series of cash payments over certain time periods, expend certain minimum amounts on the exploration of the properties or contribute our share of ongoing expenditures. If we fail to make such payments or expenditures in a timely fashion, we may lose our interest in those properties. Further, even if we do complete exploration activities, we may not be able to obtain the necessary licenses to conduct extraction operations on the properties, and thus would realize no benefit from our exploration activities on the properties. In addition, there is no assurance that we will be able to hold or maintain ownership of all our property rights and, if not, the area for us to explore and conduct extraction activities could be reduced.\nOur mineral properties may be subject to defects in title.\nWe own, lease, or have under option, mining claims, mineral claims or concessions and fee mineral leases which constitute our property holdings. The ownership and validity or title of unpatented mining claims and concessions are often uncertain and may be contested. We also may not have, or may not be able to obtain, all necessary surface rights to develop a property. We have not conducted title research in relation to many of our mining claims and concessions to ensure clean title. We cannot guarantee that title to our properties will not be challenged. Title insurance is generally not available for mineral properties and our ability to ensure that we have obtained secure claim to individual mineral properties or mining concessions may be severely constrained. Our mineral properties may be subject to prior unregistered agreements, transfers or claims, and title may be affected by, among other things, undetected defects. We may incur significant costs related to defending the title to our properties. A successful claim contesting our title to a property may cause us to compensate other persons or perhaps reduce our interest in the affected property or lose our rights to explore and, if warranted, develop that property. This could result in us not being compensated for our prior expenditures relating to the property. Also, in any such case, the investigation and resolution of title issues would divert our management's time from ongoing exploration and, if warranted, development programs.\nBecause we may be unable to secure access rights, we may be unable to explore and/or develop our properties.\nOur mineral rights do not always include rights of access or use of the surface of lands. We require agreements with land owners for these rights which may be difficult to obtain and which may require cash payments.\nBecause mineral exploration and mine construction activities are inherently risky, we may be exposed to environmental liabilities.\nThe business of mineral exploration and extraction involves a high degree of risk. Few properties that are explored are ultimately developed into production. At present, none of our properties has a known body of commercial ore. Unusual or unexpected formations, formation pressures, fires, power outages, labor disruptions, flooding, explosions and the inability to obtain suitable or adequate machinery, equipment or labor are other risks involved in extraction operations and the conduct of exploration programs. Although we intend to carry liability insurance with respect to our mineral exploration operations, we may become subject to liability for damage to life and property, environmental damage or hazards against which we cannot insure or against which we may elect not to insure. Previous mining operations may have caused environmental damage at certain of our properties. It may be difficult or impossible to assess the extent to which such damage was caused by us or by the activities of previous operators, in which case, any indemnities and exemptions from liability may be ineffective. If any of our properties is found to have commercial quantities of ore, we would be subject to additional risks respecting any mine construction and extraction activities. Most exploration projects do not result in the discovery of commercially mineable deposits of ore.\nAcquisitions and integration issues may expose us to additional risks which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business strategy includes making targeted acquisitions. Any acquisition that we make may be of a significant size, may change the scale of our business and operations, and may expose us to new geographic, political, operating, financial and geological risks. The success of our acquisition activities depends on our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates, negotiate acceptable terms for any such acquisition and integrate the acquired operations successfully with our own. Any acquisitions would be accompanied by risks which could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, there may be significant decreases in commodity prices after we have committed to complete the transaction and have established the purchase price or exchange ratio; a material ore body may prove to be below expectations; we may have difficulty integrating and assimilating the operations and personnel of any acquired companies, realizing anticipated synergies and maximizing the financial and strategic position of the combined enterprise and maintaining uniform standards, policies and controls across the organization; the integration of the acquired business or assets may disrupt our ongoing business and our relationships with employees, customers, suppliers and contractors; and the acquired business or assets may have unknown liabilities which may be significant. If we choose to use equity securities as consideration for such an acquisition, existing stockholders may suffer dilution. Alternatively, we may choose to finance any such acquisition with our existing resources. There can be no assurance that we would be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with such acquisitions.\nThe mining industry is highly competitive.\nThe business of the acquisition, exploration, and development of uranium properties is intensely competitive. We will be required to compete, in the future, directly with other corporations that may have better access to potential uranium resources, more developed infrastructure, more available capital, have better access to necessary financing, and more knowledgeable and available employees than us. We may encounter competition in acquiring uranium properties, hiring mining professionals, obtaining mining resources, such as manpower, drill rigs, and other mining equipment. Such competitors could outbid us for potential projects or produce minerals at lower costs. Increased competition could also affect our ability to attract necessary capital funding or acquire suitable producing properties or prospects for uranium exploration in the future.\nRisks Related to Corporate and Financial Structure\nThere could be problems with construction, operation and expansion of the Nichols Ranch ISR Uranium Project which could result in cost overruns, extraction delays and require us to raise more capital to continue operations.\nWe are subject to all of the risks associated with establishing, maintaining and expanding operations:\nthe timing and cost of the construction of wellfields and related facilities;\nthe availability and costs of skilled labor;\nthe ability to extend or replace our toll processing agreement for elution and packaging;\nour ability to meet the requirements of our sales agreements and to secure new sales agreements;\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental approval and permit requirements;\nthe availability of funds to finance additional construction and development activities;\npotential opposition from non-governmental organizations, environmental groups, local groups or local inhabitants which may delay or prevent development activities; and\npotential increases in operating costs due to changes in the cost of fuel, power, materials and supplies.\nIt is common in new extraction operations to experience unexpected problems in development. In addition, delays in mineral production often occur. Any delay in the performance of any one or more of the contractors, suppliers, consultants or other persons on which we depend, or lack of availability of required equipment, material, supplies or workers could delay operations. Any delays or other problems in starting up could result in cost overruns, delay or prevent production and require us to raise additional capital to continue operations. If we are unable to raise additional capital, as needed, we may not be able to continue extraction operations.\nWe may not be able to achieve targeted extraction rates at our Nichols Ranch ISR Uranium Project.\nExtraction operations at our Nichols Ranch ISR Uranium Project is dependent on a number of risk factors, including regulatory requirements, changes in governmental regulations, loss of key employees, environmental and mining hazards, lack of necessary materials and supplies, uncertainty in resource estimates and fluctuations in the price of uranium. Any changes in these risk factors could result in us not achieving targeted uranium extraction amounts, which could result in us not being profitable.\nOperating Costs at the Nichols Ranch ISR Uranium Project could be higher than anticipated.\nWe estimate operating and sustaining capital costs for the Nichols Ranch ISR Uranium Project based on information available, and believe that these estimates are accurate. However, costs for labor, regulatory compliance, energy, mine and plant equipment and materials needed for mine operations and development vary industry-wide. In light of these factors, future costs related to extraction operations and construction may differ from, and in some cases exceed our estimates.\nWe have limited operating history upon which we can base forecasts of estimated future rates of extraction and operating costs for the Nichols Ranch ISR Uranium Project. Such forecasts derive estimates of extraction quantities and cash operating costs from, among other things:\nanticipated grades and metallurgical characteristics of the ore to be mined and processed;\nanticipated recovery rates of uranium;\ncash operating costs of comparable facilities and equipment; and\nanticipated climatic conditions.\nCapital and operating costs, rates of extraction and economic returns, and other estimates contained in extraction and cost forecasts may differ significantly from actual costs, and there can be no assurance that actual capital and operating costs will not be higher than currently anticipated or disclosed.\nWe may be unable to timely pay our obligations under our outstanding note, which may result in us losing some of our assets covered by the mortgage and security agreement related to the note to the extent necessary to cover our obligations and may adversely affect our assets, results of operations and future prospects.\nOn November 26, 2013, we entered into a Financing Agreement (the \u201cFinancing Agreement\u201d) with Johnson County, Wyoming (the \u201cCounty\u201d) pursuant to which the County agreed to loan to us (the \u201cLoan\u201d) the proceeds from the sale of its $20,000,000 Taxable Industrial Development Revenue Bond, Series 2013, (the \u201cBond\u201d) upon the terms and conditions set out in the Financing Agreement, for the purpose of financing our Nichols Ranch Project.\nThe Bond was issued by the County pursuant to an indenture of trust dated as of November 26, 2013 between the County and UMB BANK, N.A. as trustee thereunder (the \u201cTrustee\u201d). The State of Wyoming, acting by and through the Wyoming State Treasurer, agreed to purchase the Bond subject to the terms and conditions specified under Wyoming Statute 9-4-715(m) and pursuant to the terms and conditions set out in a Bond Purchase Agreement entered into on November 26, 2013 among the State of Wyoming, acting by and through the Wyoming State Treasurer, the County and us. In order to evidence our obligations under the Bond Purchase Agreement, we delivered a promissory note (the \u201cNote\u201d) in the principal amount of $20,000,000, dated as of the date of delivery of the Bond and due on October 1, 2020, payable to the order of the County, and endorsed to the Trustee. In order to secure the payment of the principal and interest under the Bond, the County assigned and granted to the Trustee, all right, title and interest of the County under the Financing Agreement and any and all interests in real or personal property of the Company as security for our obligations under the Financing Agreement, the Bond Purchase Agreement and the Note.\nOn November 26, 2013, in connection with the Financing Agreement and the Loan, we as mortgagor entered into a Mortgage & Security Agreement, pursuant to which we granted to the Trustee our rights and interests in the as-extracted collateral, contract rights relating directly or indirectly to the Lands (as identified in Exhibit A to the Mortgage), general intangibles relating directly or indirectly to the Lands, fixtures or hereinafter located on the Lands or our Nichols Ranch ISR Processing Facility, goods (including all inventory) and equipment, including without limitations the ore and all personal property identified as owned by us in the Mortgage & Security Agreement to secure our obligations under the Financing Agreement, the Bond Purchase Agreement and the Note.\nIf we are unable to timely satisfy our obligations under the Note, including timely payment of the interest when due and payment of the principal amount at maturity and we are not able to successfully extend the maturity date or otherwise re-negotiate the terms of the Note, the Trustee will have rights under the Mortgage and Security Agreement to potentially seize or sell the secured properties and interests, our equipment and personal property and the Nichols Ranch Processing Facility to satisfy our obligations under the Note. Any failure to timely meet our obligations under the Note may adversely affect our assets, results of operations and future prospects.\nWe are dependent upon key management employees.\nThe success of our operations will depend upon numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including (i) our ability to enter into strategic alliances through a combination of one or more joint ventures, mergers or acquisition transactions; and (ii) our ability to attract and retain additional key personnel in sales, marketing, technical support and finance. We currently depend upon our management employees to seek out and form strategic alliances and find and retain additional employees. There can be no assurance of success with any or all of these factors on which our operations will depend. We have relied and may continue to rely, upon consultants and others for operating expertise.\nOur growth will require new personnel, which we will be required to recruit, hire, train and retain.\nThe execution of our plan to continue exploration and expansion of our extraction operations will continue to place demands on us and our management. Our ability to recruit and assimilate new personnel will be critical to our performance. We will be required to recruit additional personnel and to train, motivate and manage employees without assurance of success.\nLegislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, may make it difficult for us to retain or attract officers and directors.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain qualified officers, directors and members of board committees required to provide for our effective management as a result of the recent and currently proposed changes in the rules and regulations which govern publicly-held companies. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 has resulted in a series of rules and regulations by the Securities and Exchange Commission that increased responsibilities and liabilities of directors and executive officers. The increased personal risk associated with these changes may deter qualified individuals from accepting these roles.\nStock market price and volume volatility.\nThe market for our common stock may be highly volatile for reasons both related to our performance or events pertaining to the industry (i.e. mineral price fluctuation/high production costs/accidents) as well as factors unrelated to us or our industry. In particular, market demand for uranium fluctuates from one business cycle to the next, resulting in change of demand for the mineral and an attendant change in the price for the mineral. Our common stock can be expected to be subject to volatility in both price and volume arising from market expectations, announcements and press releases regarding our business, and changes in estimates and evaluations by securities analysts or other events or factors. In recent years, the securities markets in the United States have experienced a high level of price and volume volatility, and the market prices of securities of many companies, particularly small-capitalization companies, has experienced wide fluctuations that have not necessarily been related to the operations, performances, underlying asset values, or prospects of such companies. For these reasons, the price of our common stock can also be expected to be subject to volatility resulting from purely market forces over which we will have no control.\nGranting of options may negatively impact the value of our shares of common stock.\nBecause our success is highly dependent upon our employees, we regularly grant to our employees, directors and consultants, options to purchase shares of our common stock as non-cash incentives. Those options may be granted at exercise prices equal to market prices at times when the public market is depressed. To the extent that significant numbers of such options may be granted and exercised, the interests of our other stockholders may be diluted.\nThe issuance of additional shares of common stock may negatively impact the trading price of our shares of common stock.\nWe have issued equity securities in the past and may continue to issue equity securities to finance our activities in the future, including to finance future acquisitions, or as consideration for acquisitions of businesses or assets. In addition, outstanding options and warrants to purchase shares of common stock may be exercised, resulting in the issuance of additional shares of common stock. The issuance by us of additional shares of common stock would result in dilution to our stockholders, and even the perception that such an issuance may occur could have a negative impact on the trading price of our shares of common stock.\nThe value of an investment in our shares of common stock could decline substantially.\nThe market price for shares of our common stock has been and can be expected to remain highly volatile. As a result, shareholders might experience an extreme variation in the value of their holdings. Trading prices of many exploration stage companies, including us, have experienced price and volume fluctuations which have, at times, been seemingly unrelated to the performance of the companies whose securities were affected.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid a dividend to our shareholders, and we intend to retain our cash for the continued expansion of our business. We do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, a return on investment will be solely determined by the ability to sell shares in a secondary market.\nWe depend on our ability to successfully access the capital and financial markets. Any inability to access the capital or financial markets may limit our ability to execute our business plan or pursue investments that we may rely on for future growth.\nWe rely on access to long-term capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital and operating requirements. If we are not able to access financial markets at competitive rates, our ability to implement our business plan and strategy may be affected. Certain market disruptions may increase our cost of borrowing or affect our ability to access one or more financial markets. Such market disruptions could result from:\nadverse economic conditions;\nadverse general capital market conditions;\npoor performance and health of the uranium industry in general;\nbankruptcy or financial distress of unrelated uranium companies or marketers;\nsignificant decrease in the demand for uranium;\nadverse regulatory actions that affect our exploration and construction plans; and\nterrorist attacks on our potential customers.\nMarket events and conditions could have an adverse effect on our ability to fund our working capital and other capital requirements.\nDisruptions in the U.S credit and financial markets can have a significant material adverse impact on a number of financial institutions and limit access to capital and credit for many companies. These disruptions could, among other things, make it more difficult for us to obtain, or increase our cost of obtaining, capital and financing for our operations. Our access to additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.", "PERMNO": 91422, "SIC": 1090, "TIC": "URZ"}
