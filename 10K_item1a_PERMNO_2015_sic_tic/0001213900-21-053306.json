{"cik": "1713863", "company": "Rafael Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-10-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRISK FACTORS\nOur business, operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks associated with any one of our businesses, as well as the other risks highlighted elsewhere in this document. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks. Note that references to \u201cour\u201d, \u201cus\u201d, \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cthe Company\u201d, etc. used in each risk factor below refers to the business about which such risk factor is provided.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition and Capital Needs\nWe have limited resources and could find it difficult to raise additional capital.\nWe may need to raise additional capital for operations and in order for stockholders to realize increased value on our securities. Given the current global economy and other factors, if we need to raise additional capital there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the necessary funding on commercially reasonable terms in a timely fashion. Failure to receive the funding could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, and financial condition.\nWe hold a Warrant to purchase a significant stake in Rafael Pharmaceuticals, as well as other equity and governance rights in Rafael Pharmaceuticals, which we can\u2019t exercise, in full, at this time and may never be able to exercise.\nWe hold a Warrant to purchase a significant stake in Rafael Pharmaceuticals, as well as other equity and governance rights in Rafael Pharmaceuticals, which we can\u2019t exercise, in full, at this time and may never be able to exercise. We currently own 51% of the issued and outstanding equity in Rafael Pharmaceuticals. Approximately 8% of the issued and outstanding equity is owned by our subsidiary CS Pharma and 43% is held by our subsidiary Pharma Holdings. Our subsidiary Pharma Holdings holds a non-dilutive option to increase our total ownership to 56%. Based on the current shares issued and outstanding of Rafael Pharmaceuticals as of July 31, 2021, we, and our affiliates, would need to pay approximately $17 million to exercise the Warrant in full. On an as-converted fully diluted basis (for all convertible securities of Rafael Pharmaceuticals outstanding), we, and our affiliates, would need to pay approximately $126 million to exercise the Warrant in full including additional issuances under the Line of Credit. Howard Jonas holds 10% of the interest in Pharma Holdings and would need to contribute 10% of any cash necessary to exercise any portion of the Warrant. Following any exercise, a portion of our interest in Rafael Pharmaceuticals would continue to be held for the benefit of the other equity holders in Pharma Holdings and CS Pharma. Subject to certain adjustments, the Warrant will expire upon the earlier of (i) the occurrence of the Effective Time of the Merger, or (ii) if the Effective Time does not occur, the date that is calculated by adding (A) the number of calendar days the Merger Agreement has been in effect prior to its termination in accordance with its terms, to (B) August 15, 2021. If the Merger is not consummated, the Warrant may expire unexercised. Further, given the Company\u2019s anticipated available cash, we would not be able to exercise the Warrant in its entirety and we may never be able to exercise the Warrant in full. Rafael Pharmaceuticals may also issue additional equity interests, such as stock options, which will require us to pay additional cash to maintain our ownership percentage or exercise the Warrant in full.\nHoward Jonas has the contractual right to receive \u201cBonus Shares\u201d for an additional 10% of the fully diluted capital stock of Rafael Pharmaceuticals at the time of issuance which is contingent upon achieving certain milestones. If any of the milestones are met and the Bonus Shares are issued, we will need additional cash to maintain our ownership percentage or exercise the Warrant in full.\nIn connection with entering into the Line of Credit Agreement, Rafael Pharmaceuticals agreed to issue to RP Finance shares of its common stock representing 12% of the issued and outstanding shares of Rafael Pharmaceuticals common stock, with such interest subject to anti-dilution protection as set forth in the Line of Credit Agreement. If additional shares are issued, we will need additional cash to maintain our ownership percentage or exercise the Warrant in full.\nGiven our complicated ownership in Rafael Pharmaceuticals as described herein, the market may or may not appropriately value our investment in Rafael Pharmaceuticals.\nOur limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate our business and prospects and may increase your investment risk.\nWe have only a limited operating history upon which our business and prospects can be evaluated. We expect to encounter risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early-stage companies in the industries in which we operate.\nWe have not yet demonstrated our ability to successfully complete any clinical trials, including large-scale, pivotal clinical trials, obtain marketing approvals, manufacture a commercial scale medicine, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful commercialization. Typically, it takes about ten to fifteen years to develop one new medicine from the time it is discovered to when it is available for treating patients. Consequently, any predictions made about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history.\nIn addition, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors and risks frequently experienced by clinical stage biopharmaceutical companies in rapidly evolving fields. We will also need to transition from a company with a research focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities. If we do not adequately address these risks and difficulties or successfully make such a transition, our business will suffer, our future revenue potential may be impacted and our ability to pursue our growth strategy and attain profitability could be compromised.\nWe hold significant cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments that are subject to various market risks.\nAs of July 31, 2021, we held approximately $12.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, approximately $0.835 million in third-party and related party receivables, approximately $7.5 million due from RP Finance, approximately $5.3 million in interests in hedge funds and approximately $0.5 million in securities in another entity that are not liquid. In August 2021, we closed a private placement offering for total gross proceeds of approximately $104 million. Investments in hedge funds carry a degree of risk, as there can be no assurance that we will be able to redeem any hedge fund investments at any time or that our investment managers will be able to accurately predict the course of price movements of securities and other instruments and, in general, the securities markets have in recent years been characterized by great volatility and unpredictability. Our passive interests in other entities are not currently liquid and we cannot assure that we will be able to liquidate them when we desire, or ever. As a result of these different market risks, our holdings of cash, cash equivalents, and investments could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on IDT and Genie for a large portion of our revenue and the loss of, or a significant reduction in revenue from IDT and its affiliates would reduce our revenue and adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe have generated the majority of our revenue from IDT and Genie. In the fiscal year ended July 31, 2021, IDT and Genie accounted for approximately 65% of our revenue. The loss of, or a significant reduction in, revenue from IDT and Genie would materially and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Pharmaceuticals Business\nWe depend heavily on the future success of Rafael Pharmaceuticals\u2019 lead product candidate devimistat (CPI-613\u00ae (devimistat)). If Rafael Pharmaceuticals is unable to gain regulatory approval or commercialize its product candidates or experiences significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe have invested a significant amount of capital into Rafael Pharmaceuticals. All of Rafael Pharmaceuticals current and any future product candidates will require preclinical and clinical development, regulatory review and approval, substantial investment, access to sufficient commercial manufacturing capacity, and significant marketing efforts before Rafael Pharmaceuticals can generate any revenue from product sales.\nThe success of devimistat (CPI-613\u00ae (devimistat)) and any other product candidates that may be developed will depend on many factors, including the following:\n\u25cf timely initiation, successful enrollment and timely completion of clinical trials and preclinical studies, which may be significantly slower or cost more than we currently anticipate and will depend substantially upon the performance of third-party contractors;\n\u25cf allowance to proceed with clinical trials of product candidates under investigational new drug applications, or INDs, by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, or under similar regulatory submissions by comparable foreign regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf the frequency, duration and severity of potential adverse events in clinical trials;\n\u25cf whether Rafael Pharmaceuticals is required by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities to conduct additional clinical trials or other studies beyond those planned to support the approval and commercialization of their product candidates;\n\u25cf maintaining and establishing relationships with contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical sites for the clinical development of any product candidates both in the United States and internationally;\n\u25cf Rafael Pharmaceuticals\u2019 ability to demonstrate the safety, and efficacy of its product candidates to the satisfaction of the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf timely receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities, including new drug applications, or NDAs, or other comparable submissions from the FDA and maintaining such approvals;\n\u25cf Rafael Pharmaceuticals\u2019 ability and the ability of third parties with whom it contracts to manufacture adequate clinical and commercial supplies of CPI-613\u00ae (devimistat) or any future product candidates, remain in good standing with regulatory authorities and develop, validate and maintain commercially viable manufacturing processes that are compliant with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs;\n\u25cf establishing sales, marketing and distributing capabilities and launching commercial sales of any products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\n\u25cf establishing and maintaining patent and trade secret protection or regulatory exclusivity for CPI-613\u00ae (devimistat) or any other product candidates;\n\u25cf the willingness of physicians, operators of clinics and patients to utilize or adopt CPI-613\u00ae (devimistat) or any other product candidates over alternative or more conventional therapies, such as chemotherapy, to treat cancers;\n\u25cf maintaining an acceptable safety profile of CPI-613\u00ae (devimistat) or any other products following approval, if any; and\n\u25cf maintaining and growing an organization of people who can develop and commercialize product candidates and technology.\nMany of these factors are beyond our or Rafael Pharmaceuticals\u2019 control and could cause significant delay or prevent Rafael Pharmaceuticals from obtaining or commercializing CPI-613\u00ae (devimistat) or any other product candidates. If Rafael Pharmaceuticals is unable to develop, obtain regulatory approval for, or, if approved, successfully commercialize its product candidates, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to continue our business.\nThe Pharmaceutical Companies may not be successful in their efforts to identify or discover potential product candidates.\nThe key elements of our strategy are for the Barer Institute to identify, create and test compounds that target alterations found in cancer cells related to its production of energy widely known as cancer metabolism, for Rafael Pharmaceuticals to develop and clinically advance CPI-613 and for LipoMedix to find drug carrier systems such as liposomes or other nanoparticles to deliver effectively and safely powerful anticancer compounds for which minimizing toxicity is critical. A significant portion of the research that the Pharmaceutical Companies are conducting involves new compounds and drug discovery methods and suitable drug delivery systems, including the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 proprietary technology. The drug discovery that the Pharmaceutical Companies are conducting using the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 proprietary technology may not be successful in identifying compounds that are useful in treating cancer. The Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 research programs may initially show promise in identifying potential product candidates, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons, including:\n\u25cf the research methodology used may not be successful in identifying appropriate biomarkers, potential product candidates or effective carrier systems to confer a drug delivery advantage.\n\u25cf potential product candidates may, on further study, be shown to not be effective, have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be medicines that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance.\nResearch programs to identify new product candidates require substantial technical, financial and human resources. The Pharmaceutical Companies may choose to focus the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 efforts and resources on a potential product candidate that ultimately proves to be unsuccessful.\nIf the Pharmaceutical Companies are unable to identify suitable compounds for preclinical and clinical development, the Pharmaceutical Companies will not be able to obtain product revenue in future periods, which likely would result in significant harm to the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 financial position and adversely impact the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 valuation.\nThe Pharmaceutical Companies may expend their limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause the Pharmaceutical Companies have limited financial and managerial resources, their focus on research programs and product candidates that they may or will identify for specific indications may not be exhaustive. As a result, the Pharmaceutical Companies may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. The Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 resource allocation decisions may cause them to fail to capitalize on viable commercial medicines or profitable market opportunities. The Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable medicines. If the Pharmaceutical Companies do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, they may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for them to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate.\nPreclinical and clinical drug development is a lengthy and expensive process, with an uncertain outcome. The Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 preclinical and clinical programs may experience delays or may never advance, which would adversely affect their ability to obtain regulatory approvals or commercialize their product candidates on a timely basis or at all, which could have an adverse effect on their business.\nIn order to obtain FDA approval to market a new drug, the product sponsor must demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the new drug in humans to the satisfaction of the FDA. To meet these requirements, the Pharmaceutical Companies will have to conduct adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Clinical testing is expensive, time-consuming and subject to uncertainty.\nBefore the Pharmaceutical Companies can commence clinical trials for a product candidate, they must complete extensive preclinical studies that support their planned and future INDs in the United States. We cannot be certain of the timely completion or outcome of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 preclinical studies and cannot predict if the FDA will allow their proposed clinical programs to proceed or if the outcome of their preclinical studies will ultimately support further development of their programs. We also cannot be sure that the Pharmaceutical Companies will be able to submit INDs or similar applications with respect to their product candidates on the timelines we expect, if at all, and we cannot be sure that submission of IND or similar applications will result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities allowing clinical trials to begin.\nConducting preclinical testing and clinical trials represents a lengthy, time-consuming and expensive process. The length of time may vary substantially according to the type, complexity and novelty of the program, and often can be several years or more per program. Delays associated with programs for which the Pharmaceutical Companies are conducting preclinical studies may cause them to incur additional operating expenses. The commencement and rate of completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials for a product candidate may be delayed by many factors, including, for example:\n\u25cf inability to generate sufficient preclinical or other in vivo or in vitro data to support the initiation of clinical studies;\n\u25cf timely completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with FDA\u2019s good laboratory practice requirements and other applicable regulations;\n\u25cf approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;\n\u25cf delays in reaching a consensus with regulatory agencies on study design and obtaining regulatory authorization to commence clinical trials;\n\u25cf delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf delays in identifying, recruiting and training suitable clinical investigators;\n\u25cf delays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in clinical trials;\n\u25cf delays in manufacturing, testing, releasing, validating or importing/exporting sufficient stable quantities of product candidates for use in clinical trials;\n\u25cf insufficient or inadequate supply or quality of product candidates or other materials necessary for use in clinical trials, or delays in sufficiently developing, characterizing or controlling a manufacturing process suitable for clinical trials;\n\u25cf imposition of a temporary or permanent clinical hold by regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf developments on trials conducted by competitors for related technology that raises FDA or foreign regulatory authority concerns about risk to patients of the technology broadly, or if the FDA or a foreign regulatory authority finds that the investigational protocol or plan is clearly deficient to meet its stated objectives;\n\u25cf delays in recruiting, screening and enrolling patients and delays caused by patients withdrawing from clinical trials or failing to return for post-treatment follow-up;\n\u25cf difficulty collaborating with patient groups and investigators;\n\u25cf failure by CROs, other third parties or the Pharmaceutical Companies to adhere to clinical trial protocols; failure to perform in accordance with the FDA\u2019s or any other regulatory authority\u2019s good clinical practice requirements, or GCPs, or applicable regulatory guidelines in other countries;\n\u25cf occurrence of adverse events associated with the product candidate that are viewed to outweigh its potential benefits, or occurrence of adverse events in trial of the same class of agents conducted by other companies;\n\u25cf changes to the clinical trial protocols;\n\u25cf clinical sites deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;\n\u25cf changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols;\n\u25cf changes in the standard of care on which a clinical development plan was based, which may require new or additional trials;\n\u25cf selection of clinical endpoints that require prolonged periods of observation or analyses of resulting data;\n\u25cf the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates being greater than anticipated;\n\u25cf clinical trials of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates producing negative or inconclusive results, which may result in our or their deciding, or regulators requiring us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon development of such product candidates;\n\u25cf transfer of manufacturing processes to larger-scale facilities operated by a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, and delays or failure by CMOs or the Pharmaceutical Companies to make any necessary changes to such manufacturing process; and\n\u25cf third parties being unwilling or unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us or the Pharmaceutical Companies.\nIn addition, disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may increase the likelihood that the Pharmaceutical Companies encounter such difficulties or delays in initiating, enrolling, conducting or completing any planned and ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials. Any inability by the Pharmaceutical Companies to successfully initiate or complete preclinical studies or clinical trials could result in additional costs or impair our ability to generate revenue from product sales. In addition, if the Pharmaceutical Companies make manufacturing or formulation changes to their product candidates, they may be required to or may elect to conduct additional studies to bridge modified product candidates to earlier versions. Clinical trial delays could also shorten any periods during which any marketed products have patent protection and may allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates and may seriously harm our business.\nFurther, conducting clinical trials in foreign countries, as the Pharmaceutical Companies may do for their product candidates, presents additional risks that may delay completion of clinical trials. These risks include the failure of enrolled patients in foreign countries to adhere to clinical protocol as a result of differences in healthcare services or cultural customs, managing additional administrative burdens associated with foreign regulatory schemes, as well as political and economic risks relevant to such foreign countries.\nMoreover, principal investigators for the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to them from time to time and receive compensation in connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, the Pharmaceutical Companies may be required to report some of these relationships to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority may conclude that a financial relationship between the Pharmaceutical Companies and a principal investigator has created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected interpretation of the study. The FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection, of marketing applications by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority, as the case may be, and may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of one or more product candidates.\nDelays in the completion of any preclinical studies or clinical trials of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates will increase our costs, slow down product candidate development and approval process and delay or potentially jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate product revenue. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval a product candidate. Any delays to the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 preclinical studies or clinical trials that occur as a result could shorten any period during which we or they may have the exclusive right to commercialize such product candidates and our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of any product candidates could be significantly reduced. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nIf the Pharmaceutical Companies experience delays or difficulties in the enrollment of patients in clinical trials, the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 receipt of necessary regulatory approvals could be delayed or prevented.\nThe Pharmaceutical Companies or their collaborators may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates if the Pharmaceutical Companies or such collaborators are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or analogous regulatory authorities outside the United States.\nEnrollment may be particularly challenging for some of the orphan diseases the Pharmaceutical Companies target in the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 programs. In addition, there may be limited patient pools from which to draw for clinical studies. In addition to the rarity of some diseases, the eligibility criteria of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 clinical studies will further limit the pool of available study participants as they may require that patients have specific characteristics that they can measure or to assure their disease is either severe enough or not too advanced to include them in a study. In addition, some of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 competitors may have ongoing clinical trials for product candidates that are in development to treat the same indications as the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates, and patients who would otherwise be eligible for the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 clinical trials may instead enroll in clinical trials of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 competitors\u2019 product candidates.\nPatient enrollment is also affected by other factors including:\n\u25cf size and nature of the patient population;\n\u25cf severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u25cf availability and efficacy of approved drugs for the disease under investigation;\n\u25cf patient eligibility criteria for the trial in question as defined in the protocol;\n\u25cf perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u25cf clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new products that may be approved or future product candidates being investigated for the indications we are investigating;\n\u25cf delays in or temporary suspension of the enrollment of patients in our planned clinical trials due to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25cf ability to obtain and maintain patient consents;\n\u25cf patient referral practices of physicians;\n\u25cf the ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment;\n\u25cf proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients; and\n\u25cf the risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the trials before completion, including as a result of contracting COVID-19 or other health conditions or being forced to quarantine, or, because they may be late-stage cancer patients, will not survive the full terms of the clinical trials.\nThese factors may make it difficult for the Pharmaceutical Companies to enroll enough patients to complete their clinical trials in a timely and cost-effective manner. The Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients for their clinical trials would result in significant delays or may require them to abandon one or more clinical trials altogether. Enrollment delays in clinical trials may result in increased development costs for the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates and jeopardize their ability to obtain marketing approval. Rafael Pharmaceuticals experienced some delays in enrollment particularly in the early days of the pandemic. In the case of the AVENGER 500\u00ae trial metastatic pancreatic cancer, they were ultimately able to attain their enrollment goals in a timely manner. Furthermore, even if the Pharmaceutical Companies are able to enroll a sufficient number of patients for their clinical trials, they may have difficulty maintaining participation in their clinical trials through the treatment and any follow-up periods.\nThe Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates may cause significant adverse events, toxicities or other undesirable side effects when used alone or in combination with other approved products or investigational new drugs that may result in a safety profile that could prevent regulatory approval, prevent market acceptance, limit their commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences.\nIf the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects or have unexpected characteristics in preclinical studies or clinical trials when used alone or in combination with other approved products or investigational new drugs the Pharmaceutical Companies may need to interrupt, delay or abandon their development or limit development to more narrow uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective. Treatment-related side effects could also affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects significantly.\nIn addition, many compounds that initially showed promise in early-stage testing for treating cancer have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development of the compound. Further, we expect that certain product candidates, including CPI-613 (devimistat) will be used in patients that have weakened immune systems, which may exacerbate any potential side effects associated with their use. Patients treated with CPI-613 (devimistat) or other oncology product candidates may also be undergoing surgical, radiation and chemotherapy treatments, which can cause side effects or adverse events that are unrelated to CPI-613 (devimistat) but may still impact the success of clinical trials. The inclusion of critically ill patients in clinical trials may result in deaths or other adverse medical events due to other therapies or medications that such patients may be using or due to the gravity of such patients\u2019 illnesses.\nIf significant adverse events or other side effects are observed in any of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 current or future clinical trials, the Pharmaceutical Companies may have difficulty recruiting patients to the clinical trials, patients may drop out of such trials, or they may be required to abandon the trials or our development efforts of a product candidate altogether. The Pharmaceutical Companies, the FDA, other comparable regulatory authorities or an IRB may suspend clinical trials of a product candidate at any time for various reasons, including a belief that subjects in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or adverse side effects.\nFurther, if any of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates obtains marketing approval, toxicities associated with such product candidates previously not seen during clinical testing may also develop after such approval and lead to a number of potentially significant negative consequences, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may suspend, limit or withdraw approvals of such product, or seek an injunction against its manufacture or distribution;\n\u25cf regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label, including \u201cboxed\u201d warnings, or issue safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;\n\u25cf the Pharmaceutical Companies may be required to change the way the product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials or post-approval studies;\n\u25cf the Pharmaceutical Companies may be required to create a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, which could include a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;\n\u25cf the Pharmaceutical Companies may be subject to fines, injunctions or the imposition of criminal penalties;\n\u25cf we or the Pharmaceutical Companies could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u25cf our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent the Pharmaceutical Companies from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, and could seriously harm our business.\nInterim, \u201ctop-line\u201d and preliminary data from clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we and/or the Pharmaceutical Companies may publicly disclose preliminary or top-line data from preclinical studies and clinical trials, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We and/or the Pharmaceutical Companies may also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we or they may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the top-line or preliminary results reported may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Top-line data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, top-line data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available.\nFrom time to time, we and/or the Pharmaceutical Companies may also disclose interim data from preclinical studies and clinical trials. Interim data from clinical trials are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available or as patients from such clinical trials continue other treatments for their disease. Adverse differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could materially adversely affect our business prospects.\nFurther, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our or the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate or product and our company in general. In addition, the information we or they choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure. If the interim, top-line, or preliminary data that we or the Pharmaceutical Companies report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 ability to obtain approval for, and commercialize, their product candidates may be adversely affected, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nResults of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of results of future clinical trials.\nThe outcome of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of clinical trials do not necessarily predict success in future clinical trials. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in earlier development, and the Pharmaceutical Companies could face similar setbacks. The design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support approval of a product and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced. The Pharmaceutical Companies have limited experience in designing clinical trials and may be unable to design and execute a clinical trial to support marketing approval. In addition, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. Many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval for the product candidates. Even if the Pharmaceutical Companies, or future collaborators, believe that the results of clinical trials for the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates warrant marketing approval, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree and may not grant marketing approval of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates.\nIn some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, changes in and adherence to the dosing regimen and other clinical trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. If the Pharmaceutical Companies fail to receive positive results in clinical trials of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates, the development timeline and regulatory approval and commercialization prospects for the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 most advanced product candidates, and, correspondingly, the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 business and financial prospects would be negatively impacted.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if the Pharmaceutical Companies are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for their product candidates, their business will be substantially harmed.\nThe time required to obtain approval by the FDA and comparable foreign authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. The Pharmaceutical Companies have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate and it is possible that any product candidates they may seek to develop in the future will never obtain regulatory approval. Neither the Pharmaceutical Companies nor any future collaborator is permitted to market any new drug in the United States until we receive regulatory approval of an NDA, or other comparable submission, from the FDA.\nPrior to obtaining approval to commercialize a product candidate in the United States or abroad, the Pharmaceutical Companies or their collaborators must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies, that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. Results from nonclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe the nonclinical or clinical data for the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. The FDA may also require the Pharmaceutical Companies to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials for their product candidates either prior to or post-approval, or it may object to elements of a proposed clinical development program.\nThe FDA or any foreign regulatory bodies can delay, limit or deny approval of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates or require them to conduct additional nonclinical or clinical testing or abandon a program for, including the following:\n\u25cf the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of clinical trials;\n\u25cf the Pharmaceutical Companies may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication;\n\u25cf the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for approval;\n\u25cf serious and unexpected drug-related side effects experienced by participants in clinical trials or by individuals using drugs similar to the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates;\n\u25cf the Pharmaceutical Companies may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u25cf the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf the data collected from clinical trials of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates may not be acceptable or sufficient to support the submission of a NDA or other comparable submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere, and they may be required to conduct additional clinical studies;\n\u25cf the FDA\u2019s or the applicable foreign regulatory authority may disagree regarding the formulation, labeling and/or the specifications of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates;\n\u25cf the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which the Pharmaceutical Companies contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n\u25cf the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering clinical data insufficient for approval.\nOf the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage successfully complete the FDA or foreign regulatory approval processes and are commercialized. The lengthy approval process as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results may result in the Pharmaceutical Companies failing to obtain regulatory approval to market their product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects. In addition, even if the Pharmaceutical Companies were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve any of their product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than requested, may not approve the prices they intend to charge for any approved products, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and/or the implementation of a REMS, which may be required to assure safe use of the drug after approval. The FDA or the applicable foreign regulatory authority also may approve a product candidate for a more limited indication or patient population than originally requested, or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for the Pharmaceutical Companies product candidates.\nIf the FDA does not conclude that certain of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates satisfy the requirements for the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory approval pathway, or if the requirements for such product candidates under Section 505(b)(2) are not as they expect, the approval pathway for those product candidates will likely take significantly longer, cost significantly more and entail significantly greater complications and risks than anticipated, and in either case may not be successful.\nThe Pharmaceutical Companies may develop product candidates for which they plan to seek approval under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway in the United States. For example, we expect that LipoMedix may ultimately seek FDA approval of Promitil through the 505(b)(2) pathway.\nThe Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, added Section 505(b)(2) to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA permits the submission of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Section 505(b)(2), if applicable under the FDCA, would allow an NDA submitted to the FDA to rely in part on data in the public domain or the FDA\u2019s prior conclusions regarding the safety and effectiveness of approved compounds, which could expedite the development program for certain of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates by potentially decreasing the amount of nonclinical and/or clinical data that they would need to generate in order to obtain FDA approval.\nIf the FDA does not allow any of the Pharmaceutical Companies to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway as anticipated, they may need to conduct additional nonclinical studies and/or clinical trials, provide additional data and information, and meet additional standards for regulatory approval. If this were to occur, the time and financial resources required to obtain FDA approval for such product candidates, and complications and risks associated with such product candidates, would likely substantially increase. Moreover, inability to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway could result in new competitive products reaching the market more quickly than any product candidates the Pharmaceutical Companies are developing, which could adversely impact our competitive position and prospects. Even if the Pharmaceutical Companies are allowed to pursue the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, we cannot assure you that any product candidates the Pharmaceutical Companies develop will receive the requisite approval for commercialization.\nIn addition, notwithstanding the approval of a number of products by the FDA under Section 505(b)(2), certain pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged, the FDA may change its 505(b)(2) policies and practices, which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any NDA that we submit under Section 505(b)(2). In addition, the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive, and Section 505(b)(2) NDAs are subject to certain requirements designed to protect the patent rights of sponsors of previously approved drugs that are referenced in a Section 505(b)(2) NDA. These requirements may give rise to patent litigation and mandatory delays in approval of our NDAs for up to 30 months or longer depending on the outcome of any litigation. It is not uncommon for a manufacturer of an approved product to file a citizen petition with the FDA seeking to delay approval of, or impose additional approval requirements for, pending competing products. If successful, such petitions can significantly delay, or even prevent, the approval of a new product. Even if the FDA ultimately denies such a petition, the FDA may substantially delay approval while it considers and responds to the petition. In addition, even if the Pharmaceutical Companies are able to utilize the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway, there is no guarantee this would ultimately lead to streamlined product development or earlier approval.\nThe Pharmaceutical Companies may not be able to obtain orphan drug designation or obtain or maintain the benefits associated with orphan drug designation, such as orphan drug exclusivity and, even if they do, that exclusivity may not prevent the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities from approving competing products.\nAs part of their business strategy, the Pharmaceutical Companies may seek orphan drug designation, or ODD, for any eligible product candidates they develop, but they may be unsuccessful in obtaining or maintaining the benefits of such designations.\nRegulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States. Rafael Pharmaceuticals has received ODD for CPI-613 (devimistat) for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, Burkitt\u2019s lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphomas, soft tissue sarcoma and biliary cancer.\nIn the United States, ODD entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product that has ODD subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity in the United States provides that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA or other comparable submission, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan product exclusivity or if FDA finds that the holder of the orphan exclusivity has not shown that it can ensure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan product to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the product was designated.\nEven if the Pharmaceutical Companies obtain ODD for a product candidate, they may not be able to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for that product candidate. The Pharmaceutical Companies may not be the first to obtain marketing approval of any product candidate for which they have obtained ODD for the orphan-designated indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be limited if the Pharmaceutical Companies seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan-designated indication or may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if they are unable to ensure that they will be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nFurther, even if the Pharmaceutical Companies obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active ingredients be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care or the manufacturer of the product with orphan exclusivity is unable to maintain sufficient product quantity. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the product candidate any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process.\nDisruptions at the FDA and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire, retain or deploy key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new or modified products from being developed, approved or commercialized in a timely manner or at all, which could negatively impact our business.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, statutory, regulatory and policy changes, the FDA\u2019s ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and other events that may otherwise affect the FDA\u2019s ability to perform routine functions. Average review times at the FDA have fluctuated in recent years. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs or modifications to approved drugs to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, including for 35 days beginning on December 22, 2018, the US government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical FDA employees and stop critical activities.\nSeparately, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 10, 2020 the FDA announced its intention to postpone most inspections of foreign manufacturing facilities and products, and on March 18, 2020 the FDA temporarily postponed routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities. Subsequently, on July 10, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to resume certain on-site inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities subject to a risk-based prioritization system. The FDA intends to use this risk-based assessment system to identify the categories of regulatory activity that can occur within a given geographic area, ranging from mission critical inspections to resumption of all regulatory activities. Additionally, on April 15, 2021, the FDA issued a guidance document in which the FDA described its plans to conduct voluntary remote interactive evaluations of certain drug manufacturing facilities and clinical research sites. According to the guidance, the FDA intends to request such remote interactive evaluations in situations where an in-person inspection would not be prioritized, deemed mission-critical, or where direct inspection is otherwise limited by travel restrictions, but where the FDA determines that remote evaluation would be appropriate. Regulatory authorities outside the United States may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nEven if the Pharmaceutical Companies receive regulatory approval for any product candidate, they will be subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense.\nAny regulatory approvals that the Pharmaceutical Companies may receive for their product candidates will require the submission of reports to regulatory authorities and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product, may contain significant limitations related to use restrictions for specified age groups, warnings, precautions or contraindications, and may include burdensome post-approval study or risk management requirements. For example, the FDA may require a REMS as a condition of approval of a product candidate, which could include requirements for a medication guide, physician communication plans or additional elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. In addition, if the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority approves a product candidate, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion, import, export and recordkeeping for our products will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMP and GCP requirements for any clinical trials that are conducted post-approval. Manufacturers of approved products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic, unannounced inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations and standards. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with marketed products, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with third-party manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:\n\u25cf restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of our products, withdrawal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u25cf restrictions on product distribution or use, or requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf fines, restitutions, disgorgement of profits or revenue, warning letters, untitled letters or holds on clinical trials;\n\u25cf refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or suspension or revocation of approvals;\n\u25cf product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of our products; and\n\u25cf injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 ability to commercialize their product candidates and generate revenue and could require the Pharmaceutical Companies to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity.\nThe FDA\u2019s and other regulatory authorities\u2019 policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates. We also cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. For example, the results of the 2020 US Presidential Election impacted our business and industry. Namely, the Trump administration took several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, that imposed significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delayed, the FDA\u2019s ability to engage in routine oversight activities, such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications. It is difficult to predict whether or how these orders will be will be rescinded and replaced under the Biden administration. The policies and priorities of any administration are unknown and could materially impact the regulations governing our product candidates. If we or the Pharmaceutical Companies are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we or they are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we or they may be subject to enforcement action and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses.\nIf any of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates are approved and if they are found to have been improperly promoted for unapproved uses of those products, the Pharmaceutical Companies may become subject to significant liability. The FDA and other regulatory agencies strictly regulate the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products, such as the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates, if approved. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA or such other regulatory agencies as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. If the Pharmaceutical Companies receive marketing approval for a product candidate, physicians may nevertheless prescribe it to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. If the Pharmaceutical Companies are found to have promoted such unapproved, or off-label, uses, they may become subject to significant liability. The U.S. federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion of off-label use and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees or permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed. If the Pharmaceutical Companies cannot successfully manage the promotion of their product candidates, if approved, they could become subject to significant liability, which would materially adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nEven if any of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates receive marketing approval, they may fail to achieve the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nIf any of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates receive marketing approval, they may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community. For example, current cancer treatments like chemotherapy and radiation therapy are well established in the medical community, and doctors may continue to rely on these treatments. If the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, the Pharmaceutical Companies may not generate significant product revenue and may not become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf the efficacy, safety profile and potential advantages compared to alternative treatments;\n\u25cf the approval, availability, market acceptance and reimbursement for the companion diagnostic;\n\u25cf the ability to offer the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 medicines for sale at competitive prices;\n\u25cf convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;\n\u25cf the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies;\n\u25cf ensuring uninterrupted product supply;\n\u25cf the strength of marketing and distribution support;\n\u25cf sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement; and\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of any side effects.\nIf any of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates are approved but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, hospitals, healthcare payors and patients, they may not generate or derive sufficient revenue from that product candidate and their financial results could be negatively impacted.\nWe are dependent upon third parties for a variety of functions. These arrangements may not provide us with the benefits we expect.\nWe rely on third parties to perform a variety of functions. We are party to numerous agreements that place substantial responsibility on clinical research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations, consultants and other service providers for the development of our product candidates. We also rely on medical and academic institutions to perform aspects of our clinical trials of product candidates. In addition, an element of our research and development strategy has been to in-license technology and product candidates from academic and government institutions in order to minimize or eliminate investments in early research. We may not be able to enter new arrangements without undue delays or expenditures, and these arrangements may not allow us to compete successfully. Moreover, if third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, meet expected deadlines or conduct clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or applicable protocols, our product candidates may not be approved for marketing and commercialization or such approval may be delayed. If that occurs, we or our collaborators will not be able, or may be delayed in our efforts, to commercialize our product candidates.\nIf, in the future, the Pharmaceutical Companies are unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to sell and market the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates, the Pharmaceutical Companies may not be successful in commercializing their product candidates if and when they are approved.\nThe Pharmaceutical Companies do not have a sales or marketing infrastructure and have little experience in the sale, marketing or distribution of pharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success for any approved medicine for which the Pharmaceutical Companies retain sales and marketing responsibilities, they must either develop a sales and marketing organization or outsource these functions to other third parties. In the future, the Pharmaceutical Companies may choose to build a focused sales and marketing infrastructure to sell, or participate in sales activities with their collaborators for, some of their product candidates if and when they are approved.\nThere are risks involved with both establishing the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 own sales and marketing capabilities and entering into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. For example, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. If the commercial launch of a product candidate for which the Pharmaceutical Companies recruit a sales force and establishes marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, they would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if the Pharmaceutical Companies cannot retain or reposition their sales and marketing personnel.\nFactors that may inhibit the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 efforts to commercialize their medicines on their own include:\n\u25cf the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u25cf the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any future medicines;\n\u25cf the lack of complementary medicines to be offered by sales personnel, which may put them at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines;\n\u25cf our inability to equip medical and sales personnel with effective materials, including medical and sales literature to help them educate physicians and other healthcare providers regarding applicable diseases and our future products;\n\u25cf our inability to develop or obtain sufficient operational functions to support our commercial activities; and\n\u25cf unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization.\nIf the Pharmaceutical Companies enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales, marketing, reimbursement and distribution services, their product revenue or the profitability of product revenue to them are likely to be lower than if the Pharmaceutical Companies were to market and sell any medicines that they develop themselves. In addition, the Pharmaceutical Companies may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market their product candidates or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable. The Pharmaceutical Companies likely will have little control over such third parties, and any of them may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 medicines effectively. If the Pharmaceutical Companies do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on their own or in collaboration with third parties, the Pharmaceutical Companies will not be successful in commercializing their product candidates.\nThe Pharmaceutical Companies face substantial competition, and if their competitors develop and market technologies or products more rapidly than the Pharmaceutical Companies do or that are more effective, safer or less expensive than the product candidates the Pharmaceutical Companies develop, our commercial opportunities will be negatively impacted.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary and novel products and product candidates. The development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. The Pharmaceutical Companies face competition with respect to their current product candidates, and the Pharmaceutical Companies and their collaborators will face competition with respect to any product candidates that they or their collaborators may seek to develop or commercialize in the future, from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. There are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of products for the treatment of the disease indications for which the Pharmaceutical Companies are developing their product candidates, such as pancreatic cancer and acute myelogenous leukemia amongst others. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are similar to the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 approach. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization.\nThe Pharmaceutical Companies are developing most of their initial product candidates for the treatment of cancer. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy, and cancer drugs are frequently prescribed off-label by healthcare professionals. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic or biosimilar basis. Many of these approved drugs are well established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products. The Pharmaceutical Companies expect that if their product candidates are approved, they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic or biosimilar products. This may make it difficult for them to achieve their business strategy of using their product candidates in combination with existing therapies or replacing existing therapies with their product candidates.\nWe and Rafael Pharmaceuticals are focused on an area known as cancer metabolism and there are also a number of product candidates in preclinical or clinical development by third parties to treat cancer by targeting cancer metabolism. These companies include large pharmaceutical companies, including, but not limited to, AstraZeneca plc, Eli Lilly and Company, Roche Holdings Inc. and its subsidiary Genentech, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Merck & Co., Novartis, Pfizer, Inc., and Genzyme, a Sanofi company. There are also biotechnology companies of various sizes that are developing therapies to target cancer metabolism, including, but not limited to, 3V Biosciences, Threshold Pharmaceuticals, Eleison Pharmaceuticals, Forma Therapeutics, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc., Calithera Biosciences, Inc., Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Forma Therapeutics Holdings LLC, Shire Biochem Inc., Raze Therapeutics, Inc. and Selvita S.A.\nLipoMedix faces competition from (i) other liposome and nanomedicine products in solid tumors (for example, Doxil (Janssen), Onivyde (Ipsen), Abraxane (Celgene)); (ii) other non-liposomal chemotherapeutic drugs in gastrointestinal malignancies recently developed or under development (for example, TAS-102 (Taiho) in colorectal cancer); (iii) biological therapy (including small molecule kinase inhibitors) recently developed or under development for colon cancer (for example, Regorafenib (Bayer)); (iv) immunotherapy approaches in gastrointestinal malignancies (for example, Merck USA), antibodies and/or vaccinations; and (v) other large companies such as Roche.\nThe Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 competitors may develop products that are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than any that they are developing or that would render their product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. In addition, the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 competitors may discover biomarkers that more efficiently measure metabolic pathways than the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 methods, which may give them a competitive advantage in developing potential products. The Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 competitors may also obtain marketing approval from the FDA or other regulatory authorities for their products more rapidly than the Pharmaceutical Companies may obtain approval, which could result in the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 competitors establishing a strong market position before they are able to enter the market.\nMany of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than the Pharmaceutical Companies do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 competitors. Smaller and other clinical stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 programs.\nEven if the Pharmaceutical Companies or their collaborators are able to commercialize any product candidates, such products may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which would harm the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 business.\nThe commercial success of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates will depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates will be paid by third-party payors, including government health administration authorities and private health coverage insurers. If coverage and reimbursement is not available, or reimbursement is available only to limited levels, the Pharmaceutical Companies, or any future collaborators, may not be able to successfully commercialize the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us, or any future collaborators, to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 or their investments. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors, and coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of their products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved drugs. Marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, the Pharmaceutical Companies, or any future collaborators, might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, which may negatively impact the revenue the Pharmaceutical Companies are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 ability or the ability of any future collaborators to recoup the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 or their investment in one or more product candidates, even if the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nPatients who are provided medical treatment for their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Therefore, the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 ability, and the ability of any future collaborators, to commercialize any of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from third-party payors. Third-party payors decide which medications they will cover and establish reimbursement levels. The healthcare industry is acutely focused on cost containment, both in the United States and elsewhere. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications, which could affect the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 ability or that of any future collaborators to sell the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates profitably. These payors may not view the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 products, if any, as cost-effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available to the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 customers, or those of any future collaborators, or may not be sufficient to allow the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 products, if any, to be marketed on a competitive basis. Cost-control initiatives could cause us, or any future collaborators, to decrease the price the Pharmaceutical Companies, or they, might establish for products, which could result in lower than anticipated product revenue. If the prices for the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 products, if any, decrease or if governmental and other third-party payors do not provide coverage or adequate reimbursement, the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 prospects for revenue and profitability will suffer.\nThere may also be delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the indications for which the drug is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for reimbursement does not imply that any drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Reimbursement rates may vary, by way of example, according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used. Reimbursement rates may also be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs or may be incorporated into existing payments for other services.\nIn addition, increasingly, third-party payors are requiring higher levels of evidence of the benefits and clinical outcomes of new technologies and are challenging the prices charged. The Pharmaceutical Companies cannot be sure that coverage will be available for any product candidate that they, or any future collaborator, commercializes and, if available, that the reimbursement rates will be adequate. Further, the net reimbursement for drug products may be subject to additional reductions if there are changes to laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. An inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate payment rates from both government-funded and private payors for any of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates for which they, or any future collaborator, obtain marketing approval could significantly harm the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 operating results, the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 overall financial condition.\nProduct liability lawsuits against the Pharmaceutical Companies or their collaborators could cause substantial liabilities and could limit commercialization of any medicines that the Pharmaceutical Companies or their collaborators may develop.\nThe Pharmaceutical Companies and their collaborators face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if the Pharmaceutical Companies or they commercially sell any medicines that the Pharmaceutical Companies or they may develop. If the Pharmaceutical Companies or their collaborators cannot successfully defend themselves against claims that the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates or medicines caused injuries, the Pharmaceutical Companies could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf decreased demand for any product candidates or medicines that the Pharmaceutical Companies may develop;\n\u25cf injury to the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u25cf withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u25cf significant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u25cf loss of revenue;\n\u25cf reduced resources of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 management to pursue the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 business strategy; and\n\u25cf the inability to commercialize any medicines that the Pharmaceutical Companies may develop.\nAlthough the Pharmaceutical Companies maintain product liability insurance coverage, it may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that the Pharmaceutical Companies may incur. We anticipate that the Pharmaceutical Companies will need to increase their insurance coverage as they continue to run clinical trials and if they successfully commercialize any medicine. Insurance coverage in this setting is increasingly expensive. The Pharmaceutical Companies may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. In addition, if one of their collaboration partners were to become subject to product liability claims or were unable to successfully defend themselves against such claims, any such collaboration partner could be more likely to terminate such relationships and therefore substantially limit the commercial potential of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 products.\nIf the Pharmaceutical Companies fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, they could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of their businesses.\nThe Pharmaceutical Companies are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. The Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological and radioactive materials. The Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 operations also produce hazardous waste products. The Pharmaceutical Companies generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. The Pharmaceutical Companies cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from their use of hazardous materials, the Pharmaceutical Companies could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed their resources. The Pharmaceutical Companies also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough the Pharmaceutical Companies maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover them for costs and expenses they may incur due to injuries to their employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. The Pharmaceutical Companies may not maintain adequate insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against them in connection with their storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nIn addition, the Pharmaceutical Companies may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.\nCurrent and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for the Pharmaceutical Companies and any future collaborators to obtain marketing approval of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 other product candidates and affect the prices obtained.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could, among other things, prevent or delay marketing approval of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 other product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 ability, or the ability of any future collaborators, to profitably sell any products for which the Pharmaceutical Companies, or they, obtain marketing approval. The Pharmaceutical Companies expect that current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the price that the Pharmaceutical Companies, or any future collaborators, may receive for any approved products.\nFor example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, was signed into law. Among the provisions of the ACA of potential importance to the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 business and the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates are the following:\n\u25cf an annual, non-deductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents;\n\u25cf an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, or MDRP;\n\u25cf a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the MDRP are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;\n\u25cf expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the civil False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;\n\u25cf a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to now offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;\n\u25cf extension of manufacturers\u2019 Medicaid rebate liability to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;\n\u25cf expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs;\n\u25cf expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;\n\u25cf new requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals for eventual publication;\n\u25cf a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians for eventual publication;\n\u25cf a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and\n\u25cf a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models.\nSince enactment of the ACA, there have been numerous executive and legal challenges and Congressional actions to repeal and replace provisions of the law. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, President Biden issued an Executive Order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The Executive Order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including, among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. It is unclear how other healthcare reform measures of the Biden administrations or other efforts, if any, to challenge repeal or replace the ACA, will impact the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 businesses.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the U.S. Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. These reductions went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs and biologics. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient assistance programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products.\nAt the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 products, once approved, or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand or lower pricing for the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates, or additional pricing pressures.\nWe expect that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, could have a material adverse effect on the Pharmaceutical Companies industry generally and on our ability to maintain or increase sales of any of our product candidates that they successfully commercialize.\nLegislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nRisks Related to Reliance on Third Parties\nThe Pharmaceutical Companies currently rely, and plan to rely on in the future, third parties to conduct and support their preclinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not properly and successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, the Pharmaceutical Companies may not be able to obtain regulatory approval of or commercialize their product candidates.\nThe Pharmaceutical Companies have utilized and plan to continue to utilize and depend upon independent investigators and collaborators, such as medical institutions, CROs, CMOs and strategic partners to conduct and support their preclinical studies and clinical trials under written agreements. The Pharmaceutical Companies will generally have to negotiate budgets and contracts with CROs, trial sites and CMOs and they may not be able to do so on favorable terms, which may result in delays to anticipated development timelines and increased costs.\nWe expect that the Pharmaceutical Companies will rely heavily on these third parties over the course of their preclinical studies and clinical trials, and they will control only certain aspects of their activities. As a result, the Pharmaceutical Companies will have less direct control over the conduct, timing and completion of these preclinical studies and clinical trials and the management of data developed through preclinical studies and clinical trials than would be the case if they were relying entirely upon their own staff. Nevertheless, the Pharmaceutical Companies are responsible for ensuring that each of their studies is conducted in accordance with applicable protocol, legal and regulatory requirements and scientific standards, and our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. The Pharmaceutical Companies and these third parties are required to comply with GCP requirements, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP requirements through periodic inspections, both announced and unannounced, of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites, and the corresponding books and records of such parties.\nIf the Pharmaceutical Companies or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable GCP regulations, the clinical data generated in their clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require them to perform additional clinical trials before approving any marketing applications. We cannot assure you that, upon inspection, such regulatory authorities will determine that any of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 clinical trials comply with the GCP regulations. In addition, such clinical trials must be conducted with pharmaceutical product produced under cGMP regulations and will require a large number of test patients. The Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 failure or any failure by these third parties to comply with these regulations or to recruit a sufficient number of patients may require us or them to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. Moreover, our business may be implicated if any of these third parties violates federal or state fraud and abuse or false claims laws and regulations or healthcare privacy and security laws.\nAny third parties conducting the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 clinical trials will not be their employees and, except for remedies available to them under our agreements with such third parties, the Pharmaceutical Companies cannot control whether or not any third-party personnel will devote sufficient time and resources to the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates. These third parties may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials or other product development activities, which could affect their performance on our behalf. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and they may not be able to complete development of, obtain regulatory approval of or successfully commercialize their product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects would be adversely affected, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.\nThe Pharmaceutical Companies currently rely and expect to rely in the future on the use of manufacturing suites in third-party facilities or on third parties to manufacture our product candidates, and we may rely on third parties to produce and process our products, if approved. Our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to use third-party manufacturing suites or if the third-party manufacturers fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of our product candidates or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices.\nWe do not currently own any facility that may be used as a clinical-scale manufacturing and processing facility and must currently rely on outside vendors to manufacture the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates. The Pharmaceutical Companies have not yet caused their product candidates to be manufactured on a commercial scale and may not be able to do so. We expect that our Pharmaceutical Companies will need to negotiate and maintain contractual arrangements with these outside vendors for the supply of our product candidates and they may not be able to do so on favorable terms.\nThe facilities used by contract manufacturers to manufacture approved products must also be approved by the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities following inspections that will be conducted after the Pharmaceutical Companies submit an application to the FDA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities. The Pharmaceutical Companies may not control the manufacturing process of, and may be completely dependent on, contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMP requirements and any other regulatory requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities for the manufacture of products and product candidates. Beyond periodic audits, the Pharmaceutical Companies have no control over the ability of their contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of any approved products or if it withdraws any approval in the future, the Pharmaceutical Companies may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would require the incurrence of significant additional costs and materially adversely affect the ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market any product candidates, if approved. Similarly, if any third-party manufacturers on which the Pharmaceutical Companies will rely fail to manufacture quantities of their product candidates at quality levels necessary to meet regulatory requirements and at a scale sufficient to meet anticipated demand at a cost that allows them to achieve profitability, our business, financial condition and prospects could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe anticipated reliance on a limited number of third-party manufacturers exposes us to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf the Pharmaceutical Companies may be unable to identify manufacturers on acceptable terms or at all because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the FDA must inspect any manufacturers for cGMP compliance as part of our marketing application;\n\u25cf a new manufacturer would have to be educated in, or develop substantially equivalent processes for, the production of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates;\n\u25cf third-party manufacturers might be unable to timely manufacture Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates or produce the quantity and quality required to meet their clinical and commercial needs, if any;\n\u25cf contract manufacturers may not be able to execute the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 manufacturing procedures and other logistical support requirements appropriately;\n\u25cf future contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed, may not devote sufficient resources to the Pharmaceutical Companies product candidates or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply clinical trials or to successfully produce, store and distribute approved products, if any;\n\u25cf manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the FDA and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards and the Pharmaceutical Companies have no control over third-party manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards;\n\u25cf the Pharmaceutical Companies may not own, or may have to share, the intellectual property rights to any improvements made by any third-party manufacturers in the manufacturing process for the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates;\n\u25cf third-party manufacturers could breach or terminate their agreements with us or the Pharmaceutical Companies;\n\u25cf raw materials and components used in the manufacturing process, particularly those for which the Pharmaceutical Companies have no other source or supplier, may not be available or may not be suitable or acceptable for use due to material or component defects;\n\u25cf contract manufacturers and critical reagent suppliers may be subject to inclement weather, as well as natural or man-made disasters; and\n\u25cf contract manufacturers may have unacceptable or inconsistent product quality success rates and yields, and the Pharmaceutical Companies will have no direct control over contract manufacturers\u2019 ability to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by business disruptions caused by third-party providers that could materially adversely affect our potential future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Each of these risks could delay or prevent the completion of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 clinical trials or the approval of any of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates by the FDA, result in higher costs or adversely impact commercialization of any product candidates.\nWe may, in the future, form or seek collaborations or strategic alliances or enter into licensing arrangements, and we may not realize the benefits of such collaborations, alliances or licensing arrangements.\nWe may, in the future, form or seek strategic alliances, create joint ventures or collaborations, or enter into licensing arrangements with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our development and commercialization efforts with respect to the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates and any future product candidates that we or they may develop. Any of these relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders or disrupt our management and business.\nIn addition, we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic partners and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Moreover, we may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for any product candidates because they may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort and third parties may not view such product candidates as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy and obtain marketing approval.\nFurther, collaborations involving our product candidates are subject to numerous risks, which may include the following:\n\u25cf collaborators have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to a collaboration;\n\u25cf collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of our product candidates or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization of our product candidates based on clinical trial results, changes in their strategic focus due to the acquisition of competitive products, availability of funding or other external factors, such as a business combination that diverts resources or creates competing priorities;\n\u25cf collaborators may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial, stop a clinical trial, abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u25cf collaborators could independently develop, or develop with third parties, products that compete directly or indirectly with the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates;\n\u25cf a collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more products may not commit sufficient resources to their marketing and distribution;\n\u25cf collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our intellectual property or proprietary information in a way that gives rise to actual or threatened litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property or proprietary information or expose us to potential liability;\n\u25cf disputes may arise between us and a collaborator that cause the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of a product candidate, or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management attention and resources;\n\u25cf collaborations may be terminated and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates; and\n\u25cf collaborators may own or co-own intellectual property covering our products that results from our collaborating with them, and in such cases, we would not have the exclusive right to commercialize such intellectual property.\nAs a result, if we enter into future collaboration agreements and strategic partnerships or out-license the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates, we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture, which could delay our timelines or otherwise adversely affect our business. We also cannot be certain that, following a strategic transaction or license, we will achieve the revenue or specific net income that justifies such transaction. Furthermore, if conflicts arise between our future corporate or academic collaborators or strategic partners and us, the other party may act in a manner adverse to us and could limit our ability to implement our strategies. Any delays in entering into future collaborations or strategic partnership agreements related to our product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates in certain geographies for certain indications, which would harm our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 relationships with customers, physicians and third-party payors may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, health information privacy and security laws, and other healthcare laws and regulations. If they or their respective employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners, or vendors violate these laws, they could face substantial penalties.\nThe Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 relationships with customers, physicians, and third-party payors may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, health information privacy and security laws, and other healthcare laws and regulations. These laws may impact, among other things, our clinical research program, as well as our proposed and future sales, marketing, and education programs. In particular, the promotion, sales and marketing of healthcare items and services is subject to extensive laws and regulations designed to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing, and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive, and other business arrangements. The Pharmaceutical Companies may also be subject to federal, state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of identifiable patient information. The U.S. healthcare laws and regulations that may affect their ability to operate include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully, offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term \u201cremuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations, include any payments of more than fair market value, and may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u25cf federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal government programs that are false or fraudulent or knowingly making a false statement to improperly avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government, including federal healthcare programs. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act and the civil monetary penalties statute;\n\u25cf the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal civil and criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;\n\u25cf HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, and their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information as well as their covered subcontractors; and\n\u25cf the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, such reporting obligations will include payments and other transfers of value provided during the previous year to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives.\nThe Pharmaceutical Companies may also be subject to state and foreign equivalents of each of the healthcare laws described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope. For example, we may be subject to the following: state anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers, or that apply regardless of payor; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures, or drug pricing; state and local laws requiring the registration of pharmaceutical sales and medical representatives; and state and foreign laws, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. Additionally, we may be subject to federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities, or our arrangements with physicians, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct or business noncompliance, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent inappropriate conduct may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to be in compliance with such laws or regulations. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements will comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental and enforcement authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If the Pharmaceutical Companies or their respective employees, independent contractors, consultants, commercial partners and vendors violate these laws, we may be subject to investigations, enforcement actions and/or significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, disgorgement, monetary fines, imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and curtailment of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 operations, any of which could adversely affect their ability to operate their business and their results of operations. In addition, the approval and commercialization of any of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates outside the United States will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.\nRisks Related to our Commercial Real Estate Business\nEconomic, regulatory, and socio-economic changes that impact the real estate market generally, or that could affect patterns of use of commercial office space, may cause our operating results to suffer and decrease the value of our real estate properties.\nIf our properties do not generate income sufficient to meet operating expenses, and capital expenditures, it may cause our operating results to suffer and decrease the value of our real estate properties. The following factors, among others, may adversely affect the operating performance and long- or short-term value of our properties:\n\u25cf changes in the national, regional, and local economic climates, particularly in markets in which we have our properties;\n\u25cf changes in the national, regional, and local political climates which may influence the demand for office space;\n\u25cf local office submarket conditions such as changes in the supply of, or demand for, space in properties similar to those that we own within a particular area;\n\u25cf changes in the patterns of office use due to technological advances which may make telecommuting more prevalent;\n\u25cf the attractiveness of our properties to potential tenants;\n\u25cf changes in interest rates and availability of permanent mortgage funds that may render the sale of a property difficult or unattractive;\n\u25cf the financial stability of our tenants, including bankruptcies, financial difficulties or lease defaults by our tenants;\n\u25cf changes in operating costs and expenses, including costs for maintenance (planned and unplanned), insurance and real estate taxes, and our ability to control rents in light of such changes;\n\u25cf the need to periodically fund the costs to repair, renovate and re-lease space;\n\u25cf earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, pandemics and other natural disasters, civil unrest, terrorist acts or acts of war, which may result in uninsured or underinsured losses, less demand for office space and financial health uncertainty of the building\u2019s tenancy;\n\u25cf the current COVID-19 pandemic has had, and any future public health crises could have, serious adverse effects on leasing and on our tenant\u2019s operations and financial conditions;\n\u25cf changes in, or increased costs of compliance with, governmental regulations, including those governing usage, zoning, the environment and taxes; and\n\u25cf changes in accounting standards.\nAny of these factors may prevent us from maintaining the value of our real estate properties.\nThe geography of our real estate holdings may make us particularly susceptible to adverse economic developments in the real estate markets of those areas.\nIn addition to general, regional and national economic conditions, our operating results are impacted by the economic conditions in New Jersey and Israel. Any adverse economic or real estate developments in New Jersey or Israel, such as business layoffs or downsizing, industry slowdowns, relocations of businesses, changing demographics and other factors, or any decrease in demand for office space resulting from the local business climate, could adversely affect our property revenue, and hence net operating income.\nThe cost of complying with environmental and other governmental laws and regulations may adversely affect us.\nAll real property and the operations conducted on real property are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations (including those of foreign jurisdictions) relating to environmental protection and human health and safety. These laws and regulations generally govern wastewater discharges, air emissions, the operation and removal of underground and above-ground storage tanks, the use, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous materials, and the remediation of contamination associated with disposals. We also are required to comply with various local, state and federal fire, health, life-safety and similar regulations. Some of these laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability on tenants or owners for the costs of investigating or remediating contaminated properties. These laws and regulations often impose liability whether or not the owner knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances. The cost of removing or remediating could be substantial. In addition, the presence of these substances, or the failure to properly remediate these substances, may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent a property or to use the property as collateral for borrowing.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations also may impose restrictions on the manner in which properties may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures by us. Environmental laws and regulations provide for sanctions in the event of noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private parties. Third parties may seek recovery from owners of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretations of existing laws may require material expenditures by us. For example, various federal, regional and state laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Among other things, \u201cgreen\u201d building codes may seek to reduce emissions through the imposition of standards for design, construction materials, water and energy usage and efficiency, and waste management. We are not aware of any such existing requirements that we believe will have a material impact on our current operations. However, future requirements could increase the costs of maintaining or improving our existing properties or developing new properties.\nOur costs associated with complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act may affect cash available for our operations or to pay distributions or make additional investments.\nOur real properties are generally subject to the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended. Under this Act, all places of public accommodation are required to comply with federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. The Act has separate compliance requirements for \u201cpublic accommodations\u201d and \u201ccommercial facilities\u201d generally requiring that buildings and services be made accessible and available to people with disabilities. The Act\u2019s requirements could require removal of access barriers and could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, monetary penalties or, in some cases, an award of damages. We attempt to acquire properties that comply with the Act or any relevant law or regulation of a foreign jurisdiction or place the burden on the seller or other third-party, such as a tenant, to ensure compliance with those laws or regulations. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to acquire properties or allocate responsibilities in this manner.\nWe may be unable to renew leases or relet space as leases expire.\nIf tenants decide not to renew their leases upon expiration, we may not be able to relet the space. Even if tenants do renew or we can relet the space, the terms of a renewal or new lease, taking into account among other things, the cost of improvements to the property and leasing commissions, may be less favorable than the terms in the expired leases. In addition, changes in space utilization by tenants may impact our ability to renew or relet space without the need to incur substantial costs in renovating or redesigning the internal configuration of the relevant property. If we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the space at similar rates or if we incur substantial costs in renewing or reletting the space, our cash flow and ability to service debt obligations and pay dividends and distributions to security holders could be adversely affected.\nWe face significant competition for tenants.\nThe leasing of real estate is highly competitive. The principal competitive factors are rent, location, services provided and the nature and condition of the property to be leased. We directly compete with all owners, developers and operators of similar space in the areas in which our properties are located. Our commercial office properties are concentrated in New Jersey. There are number of competitive office properties in which our properties are located, which may be newer or better located than our properties and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease office space at our properties, and on the effective rents we are able to charge.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary technology and product candidates, if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, or if the terms of our patents are insufficient to protect our product candidates for an adequate amount of time, our competitors could develop and commercialize technology and products similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates may be materially impaired.\nWe rely primarily upon a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secret protection, and other intellectual property rights as well as nondisclosure, confidentiality and other contractual agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our brands, product candidates, and other proprietary technologies. Our success depends on our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our product candidates, if approved, and use our proprietary technologies without alleged or actual infringement, misappropriation or other violation of the patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties. There have been many lawsuits and other proceedings asserting patents and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. We cannot assure you that our product candidates will not infringe existing or future third-party patents. Because patent applications can take many years to issue and may be confidential for 18 months or more after filing, there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware and which may later result in issued patents that we may infringe by commercializing our product candidates. There may also be issued patents or pending patent applications that we are aware of, but that we think are irrelevant to our product candidates, which may ultimately be found to be infringed by the manufacture, sale, or use of our product candidates. Moreover, we may face claims from non-practicing entities that have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patent portfolio may thus have no deterrent effect. In addition, many of our product candidates have a complex structure that makes it difficult to conduct a thorough search and review of all potentially relevant third-party patents. Because we have not yet conducted a formal freedom to operate analysis for patents related to our product candidates, we may not be aware of issued patents that a third party might assert are infringed by one of our current or future product candidates, which could materially impair our ability to commercialize our product candidates. Even if we diligently search third-party patents for potential infringement by our products or product candidate, we may not successfully find patents that our products or product candidates may infringe. If we are unable to secure and maintain freedom to operate, others could preclude us from commercializing our product candidates.\nThe process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. We may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations or products and may choose not to pursue patent protection in certain jurisdictions, and under the laws of certain jurisdictions, patents or other intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in scope and, in any event, any patent protection we obtain may be limited. As a result, in some jurisdictions some of our products currently or in the future may not be, protected by patents. We generally apply for patents in those countries where we intend to make, have made, use, offer for sale, or sell products and where we assess the risk of infringement to justify the cost of seeking patent protection. However, we may not accurately predict all the countries where patent protection would ultimately be desirable. If we fail to timely file a patent application in any such country or major market, we may be precluded from doing so at a later date. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories in which we have patent protection that may not be sufficient to terminate infringing activities. In addition, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.\nFurthermore, we cannot guarantee that any patents will be issued from any pending or future owned or licensed patent applications, or that any current or future patents will provide us with any meaningful protection or competitive advantage. Even if issued, existing or future patents may be challenged, including with respect to ownership, narrowed, invalidated, held unenforceable or circumvented, any of which could limit our ability to prevent competitors and other third parties from developing and marketing similar products or limit the length of terms of patent protection we may have for our product candidates. Moreover, should we be unable to obtain meaningful patent coverage for clinically relevant infusion rates in jurisdictions with commercially significant markets, our ability to extend and reinforce patent protection for these product candidates in those jurisdictions may be adversely impacted, which could limit our ability to prevent competitors and other third parties from developing and marketing similar products or limit the length of terms of patent protection we may have for those product candidates. Other companies may also design around technologies we have patented, licensed or developed. In addition, the issuance of a patent does not give us the right to practice the patented invention. Third parties may have blocking patents that could prevent us from marketing our products or practicing our own patented technology.\nThe patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights may be uncertain. The standards that the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly. Changes in either the patent laws, implementing regulations or the interpretation of patent laws may diminish the value of our rights. The legal systems of certain countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. For example, patent laws in various jurisdictions, including significant commercial markets such as Europe, restrict the patentability of methods of treatment of the human body more than United States law does. In addition, many countries, including certain countries in Europe, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties (for example, the patent owner has failed to \u201cwork\u201d the invention in that country, or the third party has patented improvements). In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of the patent. Moreover, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patent and other intellectual property protection, which makes it difficult to stop infringement.\nBecause patent applications in the United States, Europe and many other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not at all, and because publications of discoveries in scientific literature lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we were the first to conceive or reduce to practice the inventions claimed in our issued patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for protection of the inventions set forth in our patents or pending patent applications. We can give no assurance that all of the potentially relevant art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found; overlooked prior art could be used by a third party to challenge the validity, enforceability and scope of our patents or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. As a result, we may not be able to obtain or maintain protection for certain inventions. Therefore, the validity, enforceability and scope of our patents in the United States, Europe and in other countries cannot be predicted with certainty and, as a result, any patents that we own or license may not provide sufficient protection against our competitors.\nThird parties may challenge any existing patent or future patent we own or license through adversarial proceedings in the issuing offices or in court proceedings, including as a response to any assertion of our patents against them. In any of these proceedings, a court or agency with jurisdiction may find our patents invalid and/or unenforceable, or even if valid and enforceable, insufficient to provide protection against competing products and services sufficient to achieve our business objectives. We may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO, or reexamination by the USPTO if a third party asserts a substantial question of patentability against any claim of a U.S. patent we own or license. The adoption of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, in September 2011 established additional opportunities for third parties to invalidate U.S. patent claims, including inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings. Outside of the United States, patents we own or license may become subject to patent opposition or similar proceedings, which may result in loss of scope of some claims or the entire patent. In addition, such proceedings are very complex and expensive, and may divert our management\u2019s attention from our core business. If any of our patents are challenged, invalidated, circumvented by third parties or otherwise limited or expire prior to the commercialization of our products, and if we do not own or have exclusive rights to other enforceable patents protecting our products or other technologies, competitors and other third parties could market products and use processes that are substantially similar to, or superior to, ours and our business would suffer.\nThe degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep a competitive advantage. For example:\n\u25cf others may be able to develop products that are similar to, or better than, ours in a way that is not covered by the claims of our patents;\n\u25cf we might not have been the first to conceive or reduce to practice the inventions covered by our patents or pending patent applications;\n\u25cf we might not have been the first to file patent applications for our inventions;\n\u25cf any patents that we obtain may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may ultimately be found invalid or unenforceable; or\n\u25cf we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable.\nWe are generally also subject to all of the same risks with respect to protection of intellectual property that we license as we are for intellectual property that we own. We currently in-license certain intellectual property from third parties to be able to use such intellectual property in our products and product candidates and to aid in our research activities. In the future, we may in-license intellectual property from additional licensors. We may rely on certain of these licensors to file and prosecute patent applications and maintain, or assist us in the maintenance of, patents and otherwise protect the intellectual property we license from them. We may have limited control over these activities or any other intellectual property that may be related to our in-licensed intellectual property. For example, we cannot be certain that such activities by these licensors have been or will be conducted diligently or in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid and enforceable patents and other intellectual property rights. We may have limited control over the manner in which our licensors initiate, or support our efforts to initiate, an infringement proceeding against a third-party infringer of the intellectual property rights, or defend certain of the intellectual property that is licensed to us. If we or our licensors fail to adequately protect this intellectual property, our ability to commercialize products could suffer.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate our patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets or other intellectual property, or those of our licensors. To counter infringement, misappropriation, unauthorized use or other violations, we may be required to file legal claims, which can be expensive and time consuming and divert the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel. In some cases, it may be difficult or impossible to detect third-party infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, even in relation to issued patent claims, and proving any such infringement may be even more difficult.\nWe may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensees or any future licensors, infringement, misappropriation or other violations of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their patents. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. We cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a third party or a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of any future patent protection on our current or future product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could harm our business. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, there is a risk that a court will decide that a patent of ours is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from exploiting the claimed subject matter at issue. There is also a risk that, even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the court will construe the patent\u2019s claims narrowly or decide that we do not have the right to stop the other party from exploiting its technology on the grounds that our patents do not cover such technology. An adverse outcome in a litigation or proceeding involving our patents could limit our ability to assert our patents against those parties or other competitors, and may curtail or preclude our ability to exclude third parties from making, using, importing and selling similar or competitive products. Any of these occurrences could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition. Similarly, if we assert trademark infringement claims, a court may determine that the marks we have asserted are invalid or unenforceable, or that the party against whom we have asserted trademark infringement has superior rights to the marks in question. In this case, we could ultimately be forced to cease use of such trademarks.\nIn any infringement, misappropriation or other intellectual property litigation, any award of monetary damages we receive may not be commercially valuable. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during litigation. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to file and pursue such infringement claims, which typically last for years before they are concluded. Even if we ultimately prevail in such claims, the monetary cost of such litigation and the diversion of the attention of our management and scientific personnel could outweigh any benefit we receive as a result of the proceedings. We may not be able to detect or prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Our business could be harmed if in litigation the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Any litigation or other proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights may fail, and even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees.\nOur commercial success depends significantly on our ability to operate without infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to rapid technological change and substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Our competitors in both the United States and abroad, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent portfolios and competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for or obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use and sell our product candidates and services. Numerous third-party patents exist in the fields relating to our products and services, and it is difficult for industry participants, including us, to identify all third-party patent rights relevant to our product candidates, services and technologies. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our product candidates may give rise to claims of infringement of the patent rights of others. Moreover, because some patent applications are maintained as confidential for a certain period of time, we cannot be certain that third parties have not filed patent applications that cover our product candidates, services and technologies. Therefore, it is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies for our product candidates, or processes, or to obtain licenses or cease certain activities.\nPatents could be issued to third parties that we may ultimately be found to infringe. Third parties may have or obtain valid and enforceable patents or proprietary rights that could block us from developing products using our technology. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of our product candidates, constructs or molecules used in or formed during the manufacturing process, or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize the product candidate unless we obtain a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire or they are determined to be held invalid or unenforceable. Our failure to obtain or maintain a license to any technology that we require to develop or commercialize our current and future product candidates, may materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we would be exposed to a threat of litigation.\nFrom time to time, we may be party to, or threatened with, litigation or other proceedings with third parties, including non-practicing entities, who allege that our product candidates, components of our product candidates, services, and/or proprietary technologies infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate their intellectual property rights. The types of situations in which we may become a party to such litigation or proceedings include:\n\u25cf we or our collaborators may initiate litigation or other proceedings against third parties seeking to invalidate the patents held by those third parties or to obtain a judgment that our product candidates, or processes do not infringe those third parties\u2019 patents;\n\u25cf we or our collaborators may participate at substantial cost in International Trade Commission proceedings to abate importation of third-party products that would compete unfairly with our products;\n\u25cf if our competitors file patent applications that claim technology also claimed by us or our licensors, we or our licensors may be required to participate in interference, derivation or opposition proceedings to determine the priority of invention, which could jeopardize our patent rights and potentially provide a third party with a dominant patent position;\n\u25cf if third parties initiate litigation claiming that our processes or product candidates, infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights, we and our collaborators will need to defend against such proceedings;\n\u25cf if third parties initiate litigation or other proceedings, including inter partes reviews, oppositions or other similar agency proceedings, seeking to invalidate patents owned by or licensed to us or to obtain a declaratory judgment that their products, services, or technologies do not infringe our patents or patents licensed to us, we will need to defend against such proceedings;\n\u25cf we may be subject to ownership disputes relating to intellectual property, including disputes arising from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidate; and\n\u25cf if a license to necessary technology is terminated, the licensor may initiate litigation claiming that our processes or product candidates infringe or misappropriate its patent or other intellectual property rights and/or that we breached our obligations under the license agreement, and we and our collaborators would need to defend against such proceedings.\nThese lawsuits and proceedings, regardless of merit, are time-consuming and expensive to initiate, maintain, defend or settle, and could divert the time and attention of managerial and technical personnel, which could materially adversely affect our business. Any such claim could also force use to do one or more of the following:\n\u25cf incur substantial monetary liability for infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights, which we may have to pay if a court decides that the product candidate, service, or technology at issue infringes or violates the third party\u2019s rights, and if the court finds that the infringement was willful, we could be ordered to pay up to treble damages and the third party\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees;\n\u25cf pay substantial damages to our customers or end users to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non-infringing technology;\n\u25cf stop manufacturing, offering for sale, selling, using, importing, exporting or licensing the product or technology incorporating the allegedly infringing technology or stop incorporating the allegedly infringing technology into such product, service, or technology;\n\u25cf obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license, which may require us to pay substantial upfront fees or royalties to sell or use the relevant technology and which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all;\n\u25cf redesign our product candidates, services, and technology so they do not infringe or violate the third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, which may not be possible or may require substantial monetary expenditures and time;\n\u25cf enter into cross-licenses with our competitors, which could weaken our overall intellectual property position;\n\u25cf lose the opportunity to license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our intellectual property against others;\n\u25cf find alternative suppliers for non-infringing products and technologies, which could be costly and create significant delay; or\n\u25cf relinquish rights associated with one or more of our patent claims, if our claims are held invalid or otherwise unenforceable.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, intellectual property litigation, regardless of its outcome, may cause negative publicity, adversely impact prospective customers, cause product shipment delays, or prohibit us from manufacturing, marketing or otherwise commercializing our products, services and technology. Any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition or cash flows.\nIn addition, we may indemnify our customers and distributors against claims relating to the infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties related to our product candidates. Third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers or distributors. These claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers or distributors, regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers, suppliers or distributors, or may be required to obtain licenses for the product candidates, or services they use. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our customers may be forced to stop using our products or services.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock. The occurrence of any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition or cash flows.\nIf we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position may be harmed.\nIn addition to patent and trademark protection, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. Because we expect to rely on third parties to manufacture our product candidates, and we expect to continue to collaborate with third parties on the development of our product candidates, we must, at times, share trade secrets with them. We seek to protect our trade secrets, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them prior to disclosing our proprietary information, such as our consultants and vendors, or our former or current employees. These agreements typically limit the rights of third parties to use or disclose our confidential information, including our trade secrets. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, however, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our trade secrets and other unpatented or unregistered proprietary information, and once disclosed, we are likely to lose trade secret protection. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures of our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be effective. In addition, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to enforce trade secret protection. A competitor\u2019s discovery of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and have an adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Additionally, we cannot be certain that competitors will not gain access to our trade secrets and other proprietary confidential information or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques.\nChanges in patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our existing and future product candidates and processes.\nAs is the case with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries involves both technological and legal complexity, and is therefore costly, time consuming, and inherently uncertain. In addition, the United States has recently enacted and is currently implementing wide-ranging patent reform legislation. Recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. On September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith Act was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art, may affect patent litigation, and switched the United States patent system from a \u201cfirst-to-invent\u201d system to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system. Under a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system, assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application generally will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether another inventor had conceived or reduced to practice the invention earlier. The USPTO recently developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, in particular, the first-to-file provisions, only became effective on March 16, 2013. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. The Leahy-Smith Act and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nIn addition, patent reform legislation may pass in the future that could lead to additional uncertainties and increased costs surrounding the prosecution, enforcement and defense of our patents and pending patent applications. Recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. Furthermore, the U.S. Supreme Court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws of the United States are interpreted. Similarly, foreign courts have made, and will likely continue to make, changes in how the patent laws in their respective jurisdictions are interpreted. We cannot predict future changes in the interpretation of patent laws or changes to patent laws that might be enacted into law by United States and foreign legislative bodies. Those changes may materially affect our patents or patent applications and our ability to obtain additional patent protection in the future.\nThe United States federal government retains certain rights in inventions produced with its financial assistance under the Patent and Trademark Law Amendments Act, or the Bayh-Dole Act. The federal government retains a \u201cnonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license\u201d for its own benefit. The Bayh-Dole Act also provides federal agencies with \u201cmarch-in rights.\u201d March-in rights allow the government, in specified circumstances, to require the contractor or successors in title to the patent to grant a \u201cnonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license\u201d to a \u201cresponsible applicant or applicants.\u201d If the patent owner refuses to do so, the government may grant the license itself. We partner with a number of universities, including the University of Iowa and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, with respect to certain of our research, development and manufacturing. While it is our policy to avoid engaging our university partners in projects in which there is a risk that federal funds may be commingled, we cannot be sure that any co-developed intellectual property will be free from government rights pursuant to the Bayh-Dole Act. If, in the future, we co-own or license in technology which is critical to our business that is developed in whole or in part with federal funds subject to the Bayh-Dole Act, our ability to enforce or otherwise exploit patents covering such technology may be adversely affected.\nIf we do not obtain patent term extensions in the United States under the Hatch-Waxman Act and in foreign countries under similar legislation with respect to our product candidates, thereby potentially extending the term of marketing exclusivity for such product candidates, our business may be harmed.\nIn the United States, a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug or biologic may be eligible for a term extension designed to restore the period of the patent term that is lost during the premarket regulatory review process conducted by the FDA. Depending upon the timing, duration and conditions of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, which permits a patent term extension of up to a maximum of five years beyond the normal expiration of the patent if the patent is eligible for such an extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act as compensation for patent term lost during development and the FDA regulatory review process, which is limited to the approved indication (and potentially additional indications approved during the period of extension) covered by the patent. This extension is limited to only one patent that covers the approved product, the approved use of the product, or a method of manufacturing the product. However, the applicable authorities, including the FDA and the USPTO in the United States, and any equivalent regulatory authority in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request.\nWe may not receive an extension if we fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Even if we are granted such extension, the duration of such extension may be less than our request and the patent term may still expire before or shortly after we receive FDA marketing approval. If we are unable to extend the expiration date of our existing patents or obtain new patents with longer expiry dates, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data to obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case.\nObtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment, and other similar provisions during the patent application process. In addition, periodic maintenance fees on issued patents often must be paid to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies over the lifetime of the patent. While an unintentional lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include, but are not limited to, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates, or procedures, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing products that are the same as or similar to our own, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe have not yet registered trademarks for a commercial trade name for our product candidate(s), including in the United States or elsewhere. During trademark registration proceedings, our trademark application(s) may be rejected. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in the USPTO and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties can oppose pending trademark applications and seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. Moreover, any name we propose to use with our product candidate(s) in the United States must be approved by the FDA, regardless of whether we have registered it, or applied to register it, as a trademark. The FDA typically conducts a review of proposed product names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names. If the FDA objects to any of our proposed proprietary product names, we may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable substitute name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA.\nOur registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented, declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights in these trademarks and trade names, which we need in order to build name recognition with potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. In addition, third parties have used trademarks similar and identical to our trademarks in foreign jurisdictions, and have filed or may in the future file for registration of such trademarks. If they succeed in registering or developing common law rights in such trademarks, and if we are not successful in challenging such third-party rights, we may not be able to use these trademarks to market our products in those countries. In any case, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nCertain of our key patent families have been filed in the United States, as well as in numerous jurisdictions outside the United States. However, our intellectual property rights in certain jurisdictions outside the United States may be less robust. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. For example, the requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries, and we may be unable to obtain issued patents that contain claims that adequately cover or protect our current or future product candidates. Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of some countries, particularly developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, especially those relating to life sciences. This could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or the misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights. For example, many foreign countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner must grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against third parties, including government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, patents may provide limited or no benefit.\nProceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business. Furthermore, while we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in our expected significant markets, we cannot ensure that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market current or future product candidates. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our technology in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our technology in and into those other jurisdictions where we do not have intellectual property rights. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may also export infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidates, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. Accordingly, our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights in such countries may be inadequate. In addition, changes in the law and legal decisions by courts in the United States and foreign countries may affect our ability to obtain and enforce adequate intellectual property protection for our technology.\nWe may not identify relevant third-party patents or may incorrectly interpret the relevance, scope or expiration of a third-party patent which might adversely affect our ability to develop and market our product candidates.\nWe cannot guarantee that any of our or our licensors\u2019 patent searches or analyses, including the identification of relevant patents, the scope of patent claims or the expiration of relevant patents, are complete or thorough, nor can we be certain that we have identified each and every third-party patent and pending application in the United States and abroad that is relevant to or necessary for the commercialization of our product candidates. For example, U.S. patent applications filed before November 29, 2000 and certain U.S. patent applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the United States remain confidential until patents issue. Patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, with such earliest filing date being commonly referred to as the priority date. Therefore, patent applications covering our product candidates could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Additionally, pending patent applications that have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our product candidates or the use of our products. The scope of a patent claim is determined by an interpretation of the law, the written disclosure in a patent and the patent\u2019s prosecution history. Our interpretation of the relevance or the scope of a patent or a pending application may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to market our product candidates. We may incorrectly determine that our product candidates are not covered by a third-party patent or may incorrectly predict whether a third party\u2019s pending patent application will issue with claims of relevant scope. Our determination of the expiration date of any patent in the United States or abroad that we consider relevant may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to develop and market our product candidates, and services. Our failure to identify and correctly interpret relevant patents may negatively impact our ability to develop and market our product candidates, and services.\nIf we fail to identify and correctly interpret relevant patents, we may be subject to infringement claims. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully settle or otherwise resolve such infringement claims. If we fail in any such dispute, in addition to being forced to pay damages, we may be temporarily or permanently prohibited from commercializing any of our product candidates that are held to be infringing. We might, if possible, also be forced to redesign products, product candidates, or services so that we no longer infringe the third-party intellectual property rights. Any of these events, even if we were ultimately to prevail, could require us to divert substantial financial and management resources that we would otherwise be able to devote to our business.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.\nPatents have a limited lifespan, and the protection patents afford is limited. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired for patents covering a product or product candidate, we may be open to competition from competitive products and services. As a result, our patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our business.\nWhile we seek broad coverage under our existing patent applications, there is always a risk that an alteration to products or processes may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to avoid infringing our patent claims. In addition, patents, if granted, expire and we cannot provide any assurance that any potentially issued patents will adequately protect our product candidates. Once granted, patents may remain open to invalidity challenges including opposition, interference, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, nullification or derivation action in court or before patent offices or similar proceedings for a given period after allowance or grant, during which time third parties can raise objections against such grant. In the course of such proceedings, which may continue for a protracted period of time, the patent owner may be compelled to limit the scope of the allowed or granted claims thus attacked, or may lose the allowed or granted claims altogether.\nIn addition, the degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because even granted intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, provide a barrier to entry against our competitors or potential competitors or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. Moreover, if a third party has intellectual property rights that cover the practice of our technology, we may not be able to fully exercise or extract value from our intellectual property rights. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u25cf others may be able to develop and/or practice technology that is similar to our technology or aspects of our technology, but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or control, assuming such patents have issued or do issue;\n\u25cf we or our licensors or any future strategic partners might not have been the first to conceive or reduce to practice the inventions covered by the issued patents or pending patent applications that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u25cf we or our licensors or any future strategic partners might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our inventions;\n\u25cf others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf it is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u25cf issued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantage, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u25cf our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u25cf third parties performing manufacturing or testing for us using our product candidates, including technologies could use the intellectual property of others without obtaining a proper license;\n\u25cf parties may assert an ownership interest in our intellectual property and, if successful, such disputes may preclude us from exercising exclusive rights over that intellectual property;\n\u25cf we may not develop or in-license additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u25cf we may not be able to obtain and maintain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; and\n\u25cf the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nShould any of these events occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of their former employers or other third parties.\nWe do and may employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our licensors, competitors or potential competitors. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, and we are not currently subject to any claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties, we may in the future be subject to such claims.\nLitigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Such intellectual property rights could be awarded to a third party, and we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to commercialize our technology or product candidates. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees, and could result in customers seeking other sources for the technology, or in ceasing from doing business with us.\nOur intellectual property agreements with third parties may be subject to disagreements over contract interpretation, which could narrow the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology.\nCertain provisions in our intellectual property agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could affect the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or affect financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nIn addition, while we typically require our employees, consultants and contractors who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. To the extent that we fail to obtain such assignments, such assignments do not contain a self-executing assignment of intellectual property rights or such assignment agreements are breached, we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property and this may interfere with our ability to capture the commercial value of such intellectual property. If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Such intellectual property rights could be awarded to a third party, and we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to commercialize our technology or products. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management and scientific personnel. Disputes regarding ownership or inventorship of intellectual property can also arise in other contexts, such as collaborations and sponsored research. We may be subject to claims that former collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other intellectual property. If we are subject to a dispute challenging our rights in or to patents or other intellectual property, such a dispute could be expensive and time-consuming. If we are unsuccessful, we could lose valuable rights in intellectual property that we regard as our own.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining necessary intellectual property rights to future products through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nAlthough we intend to develop products and technology through our own internal research, we may also seek to acquire or in-license technologies to grow our product offerings and technology portfolio. However, we may be unable to acquire or in-license intellectual property rights relating to, or necessary for, any such products or technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In that event, we may be unable to develop or commercialize such products or technology. We may also be unable to identify products or technology that we believe are an appropriate strategic fit for our Company and protect intellectual property relating to, or necessary for, such products and technology.\nThe in-licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights for product candidates is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to in-license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights for products that we may consider attractive or necessary. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. Furthermore, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to additional technologies or products, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects for growth could suffer.\nIn addition, we expect that competition for the in-licensing or acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights for products and technologies that are attractive to us may increase in the future, which may mean fewer suitable opportunities for us as well as higher acquisition or licensing costs. We may be unable to in-license or acquire the third-party intellectual property rights for products or technology on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment.\nRisks Related to Employee Matters, Managing Our Growth and Other Risks Related to Our Business\nPublic health threats could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations and financial results.\nIn 2020, a strain of novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, was declared a pandemic and spread across the world, including throughout the United States, Europe and Asia. The pandemic and government measures taken in response have also had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred, supply chains have been disrupted, and facilities and production have been suspended.\nThe impacts on the operations and specifically the ongoing clinical trials of the Pharmaceutical Companies have been actively managed by respective pharmaceutical management teams who have worked closely with the appropriate regulatory agencies to continue clinical trial activities with as minimal impact as possible, including receiving waivers for certain clinical trial activities from the respective regulatory agencies to continue the studies.\nIn the earlier days of the pandemic\u2019s impact, Rafael Pharmaceuticals experienced certain delays in enrollment in certain of clinical trials. We believe, however, that those trials\u2019 enrollment goals were ultimately attained in a timely manner.\nWe have implemented a number of measures to protect the health and safety of our workforce including a mandatory work-from-home policy for our workforce who can perform their jobs from home as well as restrictions on business travel and workplace and in-person meetings.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may experience further disruptions that could severely impact our business, preclinical studies and clinical trials, including:\n\u25cf delays in receiving approval from local regulatory authorities to initiate our planned clinical trials;\n\u25cf delays or difficulties in enrolling patients in our clinical trials;\n\u25cf delays or difficulties in clinical site initiation, including difficulties in recruiting clinical site investigators and clinical site staff;\n\u25cf diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials, including the diversion of hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf risk that participants enrolled in our clinical trials or related staff will acquire COVID-19 while the clinical trial is ongoing, which could impact the results of the clinical trial, including by increasing the number of observed adverse events;\n\u25cf interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site data monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures (such as endoscopies that are deemed non-essential), which may impact the integrity of subject data and clinical study endpoints;\n\u25cf interruption or delays in the operations of the FDA, which may impact approval timelines;\n\u25cf interruption of, or delays in receiving, supplies of our product candidates from our contract manufacturing organizations due to staffing or supply shortages, production slowdowns, global shipping delays or stoppages and disruptions in delivery systems;\n\u25cf limitations on employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people.\n\u25cf refusal of the FDA to accept data from clinical trials in affected geographies;\n\u25cf impacts from prolonged remote work arrangements, such as increased cybersecurity risks and strains on our business continuity plans; and\n\u25cf delays or difficulties with equity offerings due to disruptions and uncertainties in the securities market\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could also negatively impact our real estate business in a number of ways, including:\n\u25cf the financial condition of our tenants and their ability or willingness to pay rent in full on a timely basis;\n\u25cf the impact on rents and demand for office and retail space;\n\u25cf a complete or partial closure of operations resulting from government action;\n\u25cf the impact of new regulations or norms on physical space needs and expectations;\n\u25cf the effectiveness of governmental measures aimed at slowing and containing the spread;\n\u25cf the extent and terms associated with governmental relief programs;\n\u25cf the ability of debt and equity markets to function and provide liquidity;\n\u25cf the ability to avoid delays or cost increases associated with building materials or construction services necessary for development, redevelopment and tenant improvements; and\n\u25cf our tenants\u2019 ability to ensure business continuity in the event a continuity of operations plan is not effective or improperly implemented.\nDue to both known and unknown risks, including quarantines, closures and other restrictions resulting from the outbreak, our operations and those of our holdings may be adversely impacted. Additionally, as there is an evolving nature to the COVID-19 situation, we cannot reasonably assess or predict at this time the full extent of the negative impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The impact will depend on future developments such as the ultimate duration and the severity of the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. and globally, the effectiveness of federal, state, local and foreign government actions on mitigation and spread of COVID-19, the pandemic\u2019s impact on the U.S. and global economies, changes in our customers\u2019 behavior emanating from the pandemic and how quickly we can resume our normal operations, among others. For all these reasons, we may incur expenses or delays relating to such events outside of our control, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled executive officers and employees.\nTo succeed, we must recruit, retain, manage and motivate qualified clinical, scientific, technical and management personnel, and we face significant competition for experienced personnel. We are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific and medical staff. If we do not succeed in attracting and retaining qualified personnel, particularly at the management level, it could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results. In particular, the loss of one or more of our executive officers could be detrimental to us if we cannot recruit suitable replacements in a timely manner. The competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology field is intense and as a result, we may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the future success of our business. We could in the future have difficulty attracting experienced personnel to our company and may be required to expend significant financial resources in our employee recruitment and retention efforts.\nMany of the other biotechnology companies that we compete against for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better prospects for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high-quality candidates than what we have to offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high-quality personnel, the rate and success at which we can discover, develop and commercialize our product candidates will be limited and the potential for successfully growing our business will be harmed.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, result in more litigation and divert management\u2019s attention.\nAs a public company, we are and will continue to be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of Nasdaq and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Complying with these rules and regulations has increased and will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are required to disclose changes made in our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. We may also need to hire additional employees or engage outside consultants to comply with these requirements, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We have invested and intend to continue to invest in resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.\nThese new rules and regulations may make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and, in the future, we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers. By disclosing information in filings required of us as a public company, our business and financial condition will continue to become more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If those claims are successful, our business could be seriously harmed. Even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, the time and resources needed to resolve them could divert our management\u2019s resources and seriously harm our business.\nIf we fail to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may be unable to accurately report our results of operations, meet our reporting obligations or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404, or any subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nWe are required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis and our management is required to assess the effectiveness of these controls annually. However, for as long as we are an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404. We could be an emerging growth company until the end of the fiscal year ending after the fifth anniversary of our initial registration statement filed related to our Spin-Off from IDT, or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company and, if we do, the information that we provide stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public companies in which you hold equity. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue, have more than $700 million in market value of our shares of common stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period.\nAn independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting could detect problems that our management\u2019s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting could lead to restatements of our financial statements and require us to incur the expense of remediation.\nAdditionally, ineffective internal control over financial reporting could expose us to increased risk of fraud or misuse of corporate assets and subject us to potential delisting from the stock exchange on which we list, regulatory investigations and civil or criminal sanctions.\nThe relationships between Howard S. Jonas and IDT Corporation, Genie Energy and Rafael Pharmaceuticals, Inc. could conflict with our stockholders\u2019 interests.\nHoward S. Jonas, Chairman of our Board of Directors and our former Chief Executive Officer is also the chairman of IDT Corporation and Chairman of the Board of Genie and holds certain direct and indirect interests in Rafael Pharmaceuticals in addition to his interests through ownership of our common stock. These relationships may cause a conflict of interest with our stockholders.\nInsurance policies are expensive and protect us only from some business risks, which leaves us exposed to uninsured liabilities.\nSome of the insurance policies we currently maintain include general liability, employment practices liability, property, product liability, workers\u2019 compensation, umbrella, and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance. These policies may not adequately cover all categories of risk that our business may encounter.\nAny additional product liability insurance coverage we acquire in the future may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. If we obtain marketing approval for any of the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 product candidates, we intend to acquire insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amounts. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our share price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could adversely affect our results of operations and business, including preventing or limiting the development and commercialization of any product candidates we develop. We may not carry adequate specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage, and our property, casualty and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or be penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources, and our clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended.\nWe also expect that operating as a public company will make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified people to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers. We do not know, however, if we will be able to maintain existing insurance with adequate levels of coverage. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts, which would adversely affect our cash position and results of operations.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cyber security incidents, could harm our ability to operate our and the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 businesses effectively.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, our and the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 internal computer systems and those of third parties with which we and the Pharmaceutical Companies contract are vulnerable to damage from cyber-attacks, computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. System failures, accidents or security breaches could cause interruptions in our and the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 operations, and could result in a material disruption of their clinical and commercialization activities and business operations, in addition to possibly requiring substantial expenditures of resources to remedy. The loss of clinical trial data could result in delays in our and the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase their costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our or the Pharmaceutical Companies\u2019 data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, we and the Pharmaceutical Companies could incur liability and their product research, development and commercialization efforts could be delayed.\nOur insurance policies may not be adequate to compensate us for the potential losses arising from any such disruption, failure or security breach. In addition, such insurance may not be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Further, our insurance may not cover all claims made against us and could have high deductibles in any event, and defending a suit, regardless of its merit, could be costly and divert management attention.\nRisks Related to the Merger\nThe parties may not realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger.\nWhile we and Rafael Pharmaceuticals will continue to operate independently until the completion of the Merger, the success of the Merger will depend, in part, on our and Rafael Pharmaceuticals\u2019 ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our and Rafael Pharmaceutical\u2019s businesses. The parties\u2019 ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to certain risks, including, among others:\n\u25cf the parties\u2019 ability to successfully combine their respective businesses;\n\u25cf the risk that the combined businesses will not perform as expected;\n\u25cf the extent to which the parties will be able to realize the expected synergies, which include realizing potential savings from re-assessing priority assets and aligning investments, eliminating duplication and redundancy, adopting an optimized operating model between both companies and leveraging scale, and creating value resulting from the combination of our and Rafael Pharmaceuticals\u2019 businesses;\n\u25cf the possibility that the combined company will not achieve the free cash flow that the parties have projected;\n\u25cf the reduction of cash available for operations and other uses and the incurrence of indebtedness to finance the Merger;\n\u25cf the assumption of our known and unknown liabilities, including potential tax and employee-related liabilities; and\n\u25cf the possibility of costly litigation challenging the Merger.\nIf we and Rafael Pharmaceuticals are not able to successfully integrate their businesses within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated cost savings, synergies operational efficiencies and other benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected, and the combined company may not perform as expected.\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively impact our stock price and the future business and financial results.\nThe parties\u2019 respective obligations to complete the Merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. There can be no assurance that the conditions to completion of the Merger will be satisfied or waived or that the Mergers will be completed. If the Merger is not completed for any reason, our and Rafael Pharmaceuticals\u2019 ongoing businesses may be materially and adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Merger, we and Rafael Pharmaceuticals would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on trading prices of our Class B Common Stock and from its customers, vendors, regulators and employees;\n\u25cf we may be required to pay certain expenses incurred in connection with the Merger, whether or not the Merger is completed;\n\u25cf the Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the operation of our business prior to the closing of the Merger, and such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to the consent of the other parties, may prevent us from making certain acquisitions, taking certain other specified actions or otherwise pursuing business opportunities during the pendency of the Merger that we would have made, taken or pursued if these restrictions were not in place; and\n\u25cf matters relating to the Merger (including integration planning) will require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management and the expenditure of significant funds in the form of fees and expenses, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us as an independent company.\nIn addition, each of us and Rafael Pharmaceuticals could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger or related to any proceeding to specifically enforce our or Rafael Pharmaceuticals\u2019 obligations under the Merger Agreement. If any of these risks materialize, they may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, financial results and stock prices.\nFor additional risk factors related to the Merger, please see the Risk Factors section of our Registration Statement on Form S-4 (File No. 333-259524) filed with the SEC on September 14, 2021.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation of the value of our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our equity securities. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to any appreciation in the value of our common stock, which is not certain.\nEight trusts for the benefit of sons and daughters of Howard S. Jonas, our former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, hold shares that, in the aggregate, represent more than a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock, which may limit the ability of other stockholders to affect our management.\nEight trusts for the benefit of sons and daughters of Howard S. Jonas, or the Trusts, our former Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, collectively have voting power over 5,126,612 shares of our common stock (which includes 787,163 shares of our Class A common stock, which are convertible into shares of our Class B common stock on a 1-for-1 basis, and 4,339,449 shares of our Class B common stock), representing approximately 69% of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock, as of July 31, 2021. In addition, as of July 31, 2021, Howard S. Jonas holds 101,254 shares of our Class B common stock. Each of the Trusts has a different, independent trustee. We are not aware of any voting agreement between or among any of the Trusts and/or Howard S. Jonas, but if such a voting agreement or other similar arrangement exists or were to be consummated, or if all or several or all of the Trusts were to act in concert, certain or all of the Trusts and/or Howard S. Jonas would be able to control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of all of the directors and the approval of significant corporate matters, including any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. As a result, the ability of any of our other stockholders to influence our management may be limited.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. Outstanding shares of our common stock may be freely sold in the public market at any time to the extent permitted by Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act, or to the extent that such shares have already been registered under the Securities Act and are held by non-affiliates of ours. Moreover, holders of a substantial number of shares of our common stock have rights, subject to certain conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or other stockholders. We also have registered all shares of common stock that we may issue under our equity compensation plans or that are issuable upon exercise of outstanding options. These shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance and once vested, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates. If any of these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (a) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion or more, (b) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the completion of our Spin-Off (July 31, 2023), (c) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years, or (d) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include:\n\u25cf not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or Section 404;\n\u25cf an exemption from compliance with the requirement of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the communication of critical audit matters in the auditor\u2019s report on the financial statements;\n\u25cf reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and\n\u25cf exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe may choose to take advantage of some, but not all, of the available exemptions. In particular, we have not included all of the executive compensation information that would be required if we were not an emerging growth company. We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our shares price may be more volatile.\nUnder the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the extended transition period for adopting new or revised accounting standards under the JOBS Act as an emerging growth company. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.\nWe are a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are considered a \u201csmaller reporting company.\u201d We are therefore entitled to rely on certain reduced disclosure requirements, such as an exemption from providing selected financial data and executive compensation information. These exemptions and reduced disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as a smaller reporting company may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock prices may be more volatile.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIf we engage in future acquisitions or strategic collaborations, this may increase our capital requirements, dilute our stockholders, cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities, and subject us to other risks.\nFrom time to time, we may evaluate various acquisition opportunities and strategic collaborations, including licensing or acquiring complementary products, intellectual property rights, technologies or businesses. Any potential acquisition or strategic partnership may entail numerous risks, including:\n\u25cf increased operating expenses and cash requirements;\n\u25cf the assumption of additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities;\n\u25cf the issuance of our equity securities;\n\u25cf assimilation of operations, intellectual property and products of an acquired company, including difficulties associated with integrating new personnel;\n\u25cf the diversion of our management\u2019s attention from our existing programs and initiatives in pursuing such a strategic merger or acquisition;\n\u25cf retention of key employees, the loss of key personnel and uncertainties in our ability to maintain key business relationships;\n\u25cf risks and uncertainties associated with the other party to such a transaction, including the prospects of that party and their existing products or product candidates and marketing approvals; and\n\u25cf our inability to generate revenue from acquired technology and/or products sufficient to meet our objectives in undertaking the acquisition or even to offset the associated acquisition and maintenance costs. In addition, if we undertake acquisitions or pursue collaborations in the future, we may issue dilutive securities, assume or incur debt obligations, incur large one-time expenses and acquire intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense. Moreover, we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition opportunities, and this inability could impair our ability to grow or obtain access to technology or products that may be important to the development of our business.\nInvestors may suffer dilution.\nWe may engage in equity financing to fund our future operations and growth or issue equity securities in commercial or other transactions. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, or issue equity securities for other purposes, stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interest (both with respect to the percentage of total securities held, and with respect to the book value of their securities) and such securities may have rights senior to those of the holders of our common stock. In addition. if we do not provide our Pharmaceutical Companies with the capital they require, they may seek capital from other sources, which would result in dilution and possible subordination or other diminution in value of our interests in those companies.\nThe trading price of the shares of our Class B common stock is likely to remain volatile, and purchasers of our Class B common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price is likely to remain volatile. The stock market in general and the market for pharmaceutical companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their Class B common stock at or above the price paid for the shares. The market price for our Class B common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u25cf changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts who might cover our stock;\n\u25cf conditions or trends in our industry;\n\u25cf stock market price and volume fluctuations of other publicly traded companies and, in particular, those that operate in the real estate or pharmaceutical industries;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of the results of clinical trials, new product or service offerings, or significant acquisitions;\n\u25cf strategic collaborations or divestitures;\n\u25cf announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;\n\u25cf capital commitments;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u25cf sales of our common stock, including sales by our directors and officers or specific stockholders. In addition, in the past, stockholders have initiated class action lawsuits against companies following periods of volatility in the market prices of these companies\u2019 stock. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nThe realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, could have a dramatic and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts may publish about us and our business. We do not currently have analyst coverage and may never obtain research coverage by equity research analysts. Equity research analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of our common stock and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the event we do have equity research analyst coverage, we will not have any control over the analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts or others downgrade our stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and, in the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.", "PERMNO": 17344, "SIC": 6512, "TIC": "RFL"}
