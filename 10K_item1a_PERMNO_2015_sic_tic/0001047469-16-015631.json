{"cik": "937136", "company": "HYPERDYNAMICS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-09-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our common stock involves significant risks. Prior to making a decision about investing in common stock, and in consultation with your own financial and legal advisors, you should carefully consider, among other matters, the following risk factors. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also inadvertently affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially harmed.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and the Industry in Which We Operate.\nOur business is dependent on a single exploration asset.\nThe Concession is our single exploration asset. We have been conducting exploration work related to offshore Guinea since 2002, including significant seismic data surveys, processing, evaluations and studies, but we have no reserves and there is no assurance that our exploration work will result in any discoveries or in any commercial success. The PSC, as amended in September 15, 2016, requires the drilling of a minimum of one additional exploration well to a minimum depth of 2,500 meters below the seabed at a minimum cost of $46 million by September 21, 2017. The PSC has financial and other administrative additional obligations that need to be performed to maintain compliance with the PSC. Failure to comply could subject us to risk of loss of the Concession. In addition, oil and natural gas operations in Africa may be subject to higher political, health and security risks than operations in other areas of the world. Any adverse development affecting our operations such as, but not limited to, the drilling and operational hazards described below, could result in damage to, or destruction of, any wells and producing facilities constructed on the Concession as well as damage to life. As the Concession is our only exploration asset, any adverse development affecting it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe require additional financing to meet our obligations under the PSC and are unable to predict our ability to meet those obligations.\nOur current capital resources are not sufficient to cover the required additional exploration activity in the Concession. We will require additional funding to pay for any exploration activity. We will seek such funding through additional sales of interest in the Concession, from equity or debt or other financial instruments. The Concession offshore Guinea is our principal asset and we do not have the funds necessary to fulfill our obligations under the PSC as amended.\nIn order to retain the Concession, we settled our disputes with Tullow and Dana with limited financial benefit to SCS and require additional financing. Our ability to obtain additional financing is likely dependent upon the valuation of this asset, prospects for exploration in the Concession area, the time left in the Concession, as well as market and other forces outside of our control. Continued delays to resume petroleum operations had a material adverse effect on our Concession and we are unable to predict if we will be able to obtain the necessary financing in time to cover the PSC and operational obligations for the PSC Extension Period. We do not have any firm commitments from external financing sources or third parties to allow us to fulfill our obligations under the PSC, and if obtained, the terms may not be advantageous to us. We may seek such funding through additional sales of interest in the Concession, from equity or debt financings, or through other means.\nThe absence of cash inflows into our company raises substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern as reflected in the opinion of the auditors of our financial statements. If we are not successful in carrying out our plans, we may not be able to continue operations.\nOur financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern. As noted in Note 1 to our financial statements, the absence of cash inflows raises substantial doubt\nabout our ability to continue as a going concern. Our auditors have noted this concern in their opinion on our financial statements. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our plans to address this problem are discussed in Note 1. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in carrying out our plans to obtain additional cash resources. If we are unable to obtain additional cash resources, we may not be able to continue operations.\nWe have no proved reserves and our exploration program may not yield oil in commercial quantities or quality, or at all.\nWe have no proved reserves. We have drilled one exploratory well which had non-commercial results. We have identified prospects and leads based on seismic and geological information that we believe indicate the potential presence of hydrocarbons. However, we operated in a virgin basin without any hydrocarbon discoveries and the areas to be drilled may not yield oil in commercial quantities or quality, or at all. Even when properly used and interpreted, 2D and 3D seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are, in fact, present in those structures. Accordingly, we do not know if any of our prospects will contain oil in sufficient quantities, or at all, or quality to recover drilling and completion costs or to be economically viable. Even if oil is found in commercial quantities, construction costs of oil pipelines or floating production systems, as applicable, and transportation costs may prevent such leads from being economically viable. If these exploration efforts do not prove to be successful, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nEfforts to attract commercial partners may not be successful and may not be on terms advantageous to us.\nWe have no source of operating revenue and will need to obtain additional resources through sales of additional interests in the Concession, equity or debt financings, or through other means. If we seek to sell additional interests in the Concession, we may not be successful in attracting a commercial partner, or the commercial partner may not have the capital resources or other attributes that are deemed desirable by us. If we enter into an arrangement, the terms may not be advantageous to us. Any such arrangement will likely involve the transfer of a negotiated interest in the Concession, which could reduce the potential profitability of our interest in the Concession.\nAn extended period of depressed oil and gas prices could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and future operating results. Oil and gas prices are volatile, and we have no ability to control the price of oil and gas. A continued substantial or extended decline in prices could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and future operating results.\nWe currently have no source of operating revenue and are no longer carried on our expenses in Guinea following the settlement with Tullow and Dana. Our financial condition is based solely on our ability to sell equity or debt securities to investors, enter into an additional joint operating or similar strategic relationship with an industry partner, sell interests related to the Concession or borrow funds. We expect that entering into these joint operating or similar relationships would entail transferring a portion of our interest in the Concession to such partner. Such investors would consider the price of oil and gas in making an investment decision. Prolonged periods of low oil and gas prices could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, ability to obtain financing, and operating results. Low oil and gas prices in the future will likely also reduce the amount of oil and gas that we could produce economically and could have a negative effect on our future financial results. Historically, oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile and they are likely to continue to be volatile, with prices\nfluctuating widely in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022 the level of domestic and foreign supplies of oil;\n\u2022 the level of consumer product demand;\n\u2022 weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022 political conditions in oil producing regions throughout the world;\n\u2022 the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil production;\n\u2022 speculation as to the future price of oil and natural gas and the speculative trading of oil and natural gas futures contracts;\n\u2022 price and production controls;\n\u2022 political and economic conditions, including embargoes in oil-producing countries or affecting other oil-producing activities, particularly in the Middle East, Africa, Russia and South America;\n\u2022 continued threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action, including U.S. military operations in the Middle East;\n\u2022 the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity;\n\u2022 the price of foreign oil imports;\n\u2022 actions of governments;\n\u2022 domestic and foreign governmental regulations;\n\u2022 the price, availability and acceptance of alternative fuels;\n\u2022 technological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022 global economic conditions; and\n\u2022 the value of the U.S. dollar, the Euro and fluctuations in exchange rates generally.\nThese factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict oil and gas prices. Our inability to respond appropriately to changes in these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business plan, financial position, results of operations and future cash flows.\nLegal fees and associated costs in connection with legal proceedings and the Tullow and Dana legal matters adversely affected our liquidity and financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are involved in legal proceedings and although we recently settled the arbitration against Tullow and Dana, we incurred significant legal fees in the arbitration proceedings.\nThe 2016 PSC Amendment significantly reduced our acreage in the Concession and we agreed to a very tight timeline to obtain financing and begin drilling the exploration well.\nWe received a one year extension and 100% of the Concession pursuant to rights granted to us under the 2016 PSC Amendment signed on September 15, 2016. Pursuant to the terms of the 2016 PSC Amendment, we agreed to relinquish an additional 77% of the remaining acreage, agreed to a timeline to drill a well planned for April 2017 and promised to provide security to the Government of Guinea and agreed to financial penalties for failure to drill the exploration well. Our reduced acreage, tight timeline, guarantees to the Government of Guinea, and financial penalties have reduced the value of the Concession and our ability to attract financing and third parties to join us in exploration\nactivities. There is no guarantee that we will be able to provide the promised security, raise the necessary funds or meet the drilling timeline..\nThe PSC is subject to renegotiation under certain conditions which may have an adverse impact upon our operations and profitability.\nThe PSC provides that should the Guinea government note material differences between provisions of the PSC and international standards or the Guinea Petroleum Code, the parties will renegotiate the relevant articles of the PSC. If the Guinea government identifies material differences between the PSC's provisions and international standards or the Guinea Petroleum Code, there is no assurance that we will be able to negotiate an acceptable modification to the PSC. If the parties are not successful in renegotiating the relevant articles of the PSC, the parties may be required to submit the matter to international arbitration. There is no assurance that any arbitration would be successful or otherwise lead to articles that are more favorable to us than the present articles. Therefore, the results of such negotiations or arbitration could be unfavorable to us and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operation and future cash flows.\nWe may not be able to obtain the additional capital necessary to achieve our business plan.\nOur business is capital intensive and we must invest a significant amount in our activities. We intend to make substantial capital expenditures to find, develop, and produce natural gas and oil reserves.\nAdditional capital could be obtained from a combination of funding sources. The current potential funding sources and the potential adverse effects attributable thereto, include:\n\u2022 sales or assignments of interests in the Concession and exploration program, which would reduce any future revenues from that program while at the same time offsetting potential expenditures;\n\u2022 offerings of equity, equity-linked and convertible debt securities, which would dilute the equity interests of our stockholders;\n\u2022 debt and convertible debt offerings, which would increase our leverage and add to our need for cash to service such debt and which could result in assets being pledged as collateral; and\n\u2022 borrowing from financial institutions, which may subject us to certain restrictive covenants, including covenants restricting our ability to raise additional capital or pay dividends.\nIt is difficult to quantify the amount of financing we may need to fund our business plan in the longer term. The amount of funding we may need in the future depends on various factors such as:\n\u2022 our financial position;\n\u2022 the cost of exploration and drilling;\n\u2022 the prevailing market price of natural gas and oil; and\n\u2022 the lead time required to bring any discoveries to production.\nIf we do not obtain capital resources in the future it is unlikely that we will be able to continue to pursue exploration offshore Guinea and our financial condition and operations will be adversely affected.\nWe are highly dependent on our management team and consultants, and any failure to retain the services of such parties could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our operations or successfully execute our business plan.\nOur business is dependent on retaining the services of a small number of key personnel of the appropriate caliber as the business develops. Our success is, and will continue to be to a significant extent, dependent upon the expertise and experience of the directors, senior management and certain key consultants, but the retention of their services cannot be guaranteed. The loss of key members of our management team or other highly qualified professionals has adversely affected our ability to effectively manage our overall operations or successfully execute current or future business strategies. If any further member of management, director, or other consultants were to leave our company, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or growth prospects.\nWe have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes.\nWe are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits concerning shareholder claims and other matters. Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or limit our ability to engage in our business activities. While we have director and officer insurance, it may not apply to or fully cover any liabilities we incur as a result of these lawsuits. Although management currently believes resolving all of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial statements, the litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management's view of these matters may change in the future. A material adverse impact on our financial statements also could occur for any period it was determined that an unfavorable final outcome is probable and reasonably estimable.\nDrilling wells is speculative and potentially hazardous. Actual costs may be more than our estimates, and may not result in any discoveries. The cost of our recently drilled exploratory well was significantly higher than expected.\nExploring for and developing oil reserves involves a high degree of operational and financial risk, which precludes definitive statements as to the time required and costs involved in reaching certain objectives. The budgeted costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often exceeded. The cost of our exploratory well, the Sabu-1, was higher than we initially expected, primarily due to numerous delays and issues related to mechanical and operational matters on the rig, logistical delays resulting from limited port facilities in Guinea, and an expanded well logging program. In addition, oil was not discovered in commercial quantities. Unexpected delays and increases in costs associated with the upcoming well drilled in the future, could adversely affect our results of operation, financial position, liquidity and business plans.\nDrilling may be unsuccessful for many reasons, including geological conditions, weather, cost overruns, equipment shortages and mechanical difficulties. Exploratory wells bear a much greater risk of loss than development wells. The successful drilling of an oil well may not be indicative of the potential for the development of a commercially viable field and will not necessarily result in a profit on investment. A variety of factors, both geological and market-related, can cause a well to become uneconomic or only marginally economic.\nThere are a variety of operating risks, including:\n\u2022 blowouts, cratering and explosions;\n\u2022 mechanical and equipment problems;\n\u2022 uncontrolled flows of oil and gas or well fluids;\n\u2022 fires;\n\u2022 marine hazards with respect to offshore operations;\n\u2022 formations with abnormal pressures;\n\u2022 pollution and other environmental risks; and\n\u2022 weather conditions and natural disasters.\nOffshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks particular to the marine environment, such as capsizing and collisions. Also, offshore operations are subject to damage or loss from adverse weather conditions. Any of these events could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations and substantial losses.\nThe site for the next exploratory well we plan to drill will be in the ultra-deep water. Deepwater drilling generally requires more time and more advanced drilling technologies than exploration in shallower waters, involving a higher risk of equipment failure and higher drilling costs. In addition, even if there is a discovery, taking it to production presents risks that we may not be currently aware of. If we participate in the development of new subsea infrastructure and use floating production systems to transport oil from producing wells, these operations may require substantial time for installation or encounter mechanical difficulties and equipment failures that could result in significant liabilities, cost overruns, or delays. Furthermore, deepwater operations generally, and operations in West Africa in particular, lack the physical oilfield service infrastructure present in other regions. As a result, a significant amount of time may elapse between a deepwater discovery and the marketing of the associated oil and natural gas, increasing both the financial and operational risks involved with these operations. Because of the lack and high cost of this infrastructure, further discoveries we may make in Guinea may never be economically producible.\nThe cost of drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, personnel and oilfield services, as well as gathering systems and processing facilities, and our dependence on industry contractors generally, could adversely impact us.\nWe are dependent on industry contractors for the success of our oil and gas exploration projects. In particular, our drilling activity offshore of Guinea will require that we have access to offshore drilling rigs and contracts with experienced operators of such rigs. The availability and cost of drilling rigs and other equipment and services, and the skilled personnel required to operate those rigs and equipment is affected by the level and location of drilling activity around the world. An increase in drilling operations worldwide may reduce the availability and increase the cost to us of drilling rigs, other equipment and services, and appropriately experienced drilling contractors. The reduced availability of such equipment and services may delay our ability to discover reserves and higher costs for such equipment and services may increase our costs, both of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and future cash flow. If we succeed in constructing oil wells, we may be required to shut them because access to pipelines, gathering systems or processing facilities may be limited or unavailable. If that were to occur, we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until arrangements were made to deliver the production to market, which could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to the failure or non-performance of commercial counterparties.\nOur operations will be dependent on certain third parties with whom we have commercial agreements (such as drilling contractors and the parties responsible for transporting and/or storing our production) for our future exploration, development, production, sales or other activities. The efficiency, timeliness and quality of contract performance by third party providers are largely beyond our direct control. If one or more of these third parties fails to meet its contractual obligations to us, or if such services are temporarily or permanently unavailable (for example, as a result of technical\nproblems or industrial action), or not available on commercially acceptable terms, we may experience a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future cash flow. In addition, as a named party under the PSC, we could be held liable for the environmental, health and safety impacts arising out of the activities of our drilling project management contractor or any other third party service provider contracted by us or on our behalf, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and future cash flow.\nParticipants in the oil and gas industry are subject to numerous laws that can affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nExploration and production activities in the oil and gas industry are subject to local laws and regulations. We may be required to make large expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations, particularly in respect of the following matters:\n\u2022 licenses for drilling operations;\n\u2022 tax increases, including retroactive claims;\n\u2022 unitization of oil accumulations;\n\u2022 local content requirements (including the mandatory use of local partners and vendors); and\n\u2022 environmental requirements and obligations, including investigation and/or remediation activities.\nUnder these and other laws and regulations, we could be liable for personal injuries, property damage and other types of damages. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, new laws and regulations may be enacted and current laws and regulations could change or their interpretations could change, in ways that could substantially increase our costs. These risks may be higher in the developing countries in which we conduct our operations, where there could be a lack of clarity or lack of consistency in the application of these laws and regulations. Any resulting liabilities, penalties, suspensions or terminations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFurthermore, the explosion and sinking in April 2010 of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig during operations on the Macondo exploration well in the Gulf of Mexico, and the resulting oil spill, may have increased certain of the risks faced by those drilling for oil in deepwater regions, including increased industry standards, governmental regulation and enforcement, and less favorable investor perception of the risk-adjusted benefits of deepwater offshore drilling.\nThe occurrence of any of these factors, or the continuation thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or future results of operations.\nWe may not be able to commercialize our interests in any oil and natural gas produced from our Guinea Concession.\nOur Concession is in the deepwater area offshore Guinea. Even if we find accumulations of hydrocarbons, we may not be able to commercialize our interests due to the geology, water depth, distance to shore, or a ready market for the hydrocarbons. Further, the development of the market for natural gas in West Africa is in its early stages. Currently there is no infrastructure to transport and process natural gas on commercial terms in Guinea, and the expenses associated with constructing such infrastructure ourselves may not be commercially viable given local prices currently paid for natural gas. Accordingly, there may be limited or no value derived from any natural gas produced from our Guinea Concession.\nOur insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover losses, or we could be subject to uninsured liabilities which could materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThere are circumstances where insurance will not cover the consequences of an event, or where we may become liable for costs incurred in events or incidents against which we either cannot insure or may elect not to have insured (whether on account of prohibitive premium costs or for other commercial reasons). Further, insurance covering certain matters (such as sovereign risk, terrorism and many environmental risks) may not be available to us. Moreover, we may be subject to large excess payments in the event a third party has a valid claim against us, and therefore may not be entitled to recover the full extent of our loss, or may decide that it is not economical to seek to do so. The realization of any significant liabilities in connection with our future activities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future cash flow.\nThere are risks associated with the drilling of oil and natural gas wells which could significantly reduce our revenues or cause substantial losses, impairing our future operating results. We may become subject to liability for pollution, blow-outs or other hazards, including those arising out of the activities of our third-party contractors. We intend to obtain insurance with respect to certain of these hazards, but such insurance likely will have limitations that may prevent us from recovering the full extent of such liabilities. The payment by us of such liabilities could reduce the funds available to us or could, in an extreme case, result in a total loss of our properties and assets. Moreover, oil and natural gas production operations are also subject to all the risks typically associated with such operations, including premature decline of reservoirs and the invasion of water into producing formations.\nWe may incur a variety of costs to engage in business transactions, and the anticipated benefits of those transactions may never be realized.\nAs a part of our business strategy, we enter into business transactions, or significant investments in, other assets, particularly those that would allow us to produce oil and natural gas and generate revenue to fund our exploration activities. Any future acquisitions would be accompanied by risks such as:\n\u2022 diversion of our management's attention from ongoing business concerns;\n\u2022 our potential inability to maximize our financial and strategic position through the successful development of the asset or assets acquired;\n\u2022 impairment of our relationship with our existing employees if we cannot hire employees to staff any new operations and our existing employees are required to staff both old and new operations; and\n\u2022 maintenance of uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully integrate any business, products, technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future, and our failure to do so could harm our business.\nWe have competition from other companies that have larger financial and other resources than we do, which puts us at a competitive disadvantage.\nA large number of companies and individuals engage in drilling for gas and oil, and there is competition for the most desirable prospects. We are likely to face competition from international oil and gas companies, which already may have significant operations in a region, together with potential new entrants into such markets, any of which may have greater financial, technological and other resources than us. There is a high degree of competition for the discovery and acquisition of properties considered to have a commercial potential. We compete with other companies for the acquisition of oil\nand gas interests, as well as for the recruitment and retention of qualified employees and other personnel.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete effectively with other existing oil and gas companies, or any new entrants to the industry. Any failure by us to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future cash flow.\nWe do not have reserve reports for the Concession and our expectations as to oil and gas reserves are uncertain and may vary substantially from any actual production.\nWe do not have reserves nor do we have any reserve reports for the Concession. A reserve report is the estimated quantities of oil and gas based on reports prepared by third party reserve engineers. Reserve reporting is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner. Expectations as to oil and gas reserves are uncertain and may vary substantially from any actual production.\nRisks Relating to Operating in Guinea\nGeopolitical instability where we operate subjects us to political, economic and other uncertainties.\nWe conduct business in Guinea, which is in a region of the world where there have been prior civil wars, revolutions, coup d'\u00e9tats and internecine conflicts. There is the risk of political violence and increased social tension in Guinea as a result of the past political upheaval, and there is a risk of civil unrest, crime and labor unrest at times. Since 2010, democratic elections have been held, a president was democratically elected and re-elected. While these developments indicate that the political situation in Guinea is improving, external or internal political forces potentially could create a political or military climate that might cause a change in political leadership, the outbreak of hostilities, or civil unrest. Such uncertainties could result in our having to cease our Guinea operations and result in the loss or delay of our rights under the PSC.\nFurther, we face political and economic risks and other uncertainties with respect to our operations, which may include, among other things:\n\u2022 loss of future revenue, property and equipment, as a result of hazards such as expropriation, war, acts of terrorism, insurrection and other political risks;\n\u2022 increases in taxes and governmental royalties;\n\u2022 unilateral renegotiation or cancellation of contracts by governmental entities;\n\u2022 difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations;\n\u2022 changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies; and\n\u2022 currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations.\nRealization of any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or growth prospects. The Consortium's operations in Guinea also may be adversely affected by laws and policies of multiple jurisdictions.\nAn Epidemic of the Ebola virus disease in Guinea could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition.\nThere was an outbreak of the Ebola virus disease in Guinea. While the World Health Organization declared Guinea Ebola free on December 29, 2015, any future outbreak of the Ebola virus will adversely affect our business operations and financial condition.\nAny drilling activities in Guinea will require safe access to the Conakry airport and port as well as other infrastructure in Guinea. If there is another Ebola virus outbreak, drilling plans will likely be delayed, could be compromised and costs of operations will be increased. Further, if contractors or subcontractors impose travel bans or personnel refuse to travel to Guinea, drilling plans will be further delayed or interrupted after commencement. It is likely that the cost of any services could be significantly higher than planned which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, business, and results of operations.\nWe operate in Guinea, a country where corrupt behavior exists that could impair our ability to do business in the future or result in significant fines or penalties.\nWe operate in Guinea, a country where governmental corruption has been known to exist. There is a risk of violating either the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, laws or legislation promulgated pursuant to the 1997 OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions or other applicable anti-corruption regulations that generally prohibit the making of improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business. In addition, the future success of our Guinea operations may be adversely affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, risk of war, expropriation, terrorism, renegotiation or modification of existing contracts, tax laws and changes in exchange rates.\nWe have been subject to a Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission FCPA investigation into how we obtained or retained the Concession and spent approximately $12.8 million in legal fees in working with the US Government. Those matters were resolved in 2015, but should the DOJ, the SEC, or Guinea open additional investigations we currently do not have the financial ability to bear the cost of additional investigations and are unable to predict whether we will be able to raise the funds to properly defend the Company.\nWe are subject to governmental regulations, the cost of compliance with which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and future cash flow.\nOil and gas operations in Guinea will be subject to government regulation and to interruption or termination by governmental authorities on account of ecological and other considerations. It is impossible to predict future government proposals that might be enacted into law, future interpretation of existing laws or future amendments to the Guinea Petroleum Code or any other laws, or the effect those new or amended laws or changes in interpretation of existing laws might have on us. Restrictions on oil and gas activities, such as production restrictions, price controls, tax increases and pollution and environmental controls may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and future cash flows.\nSocial, economic and health conditions in Guinea may adversely affect our business, results of operation, financial condition and future cash flow.\nAs all of our potential revenue generating assets are currently located in Guinea, our operations are dependent on the economic and political conditions prevailing in Guinea. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks associated with conducting business in and with a foreign country, including the risks of changes in the country's laws and policies (including those relating to taxation, royalties,\nacquisitions, disposals, imports and exports, currency, environmental protection, management of natural resources, exploration and development of mines, labor and safety standards, and historical and cultural preservation). The costs associated with compliance with these laws and regulations are substantial, and possible future laws and regulations as well as changes to existing laws and regulations could impose additional costs on us, require us to incur additional capital expenditures and/or impose restrictions on or suspensions of our operations and delays in the development of our assets.\nFurther, these laws and regulations may allow government authorities and private parties to bring legal claims based on damages to property and injury to persons resulting from the environmental, health and safety impacts of our past and current operations and could lead to the imposition of substantial fines, penalties or other civil or criminal sanctions. If material, these compliance costs, claims or fines could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or growth prospects. In addition, Guinea has high levels of poverty, crime, unemployment and an undeveloped health care system.\nThe legal and judicial system in Guinea is relatively undeveloped and subject to frequent changes, and we may be exposed to similar risks if we operate in certain other jurisdictions.\nGuinea has a less developed legal and judicial system than more established economies which could result in risks such as: (i) effective legal redress in the courts of such jurisdictions, whether in respect of a breach of contract, law or regulation, or in an ownership dispute, being more difficult to obtain; (ii) a higher degree of discretion on the part of Governmental authorities who may be susceptible to corruption; (iii) the lack of judicial or administrative guidance on interpreting applicable rules and regulations; (iv) inconsistencies or conflicts between and within various laws, regulations, decrees, orders and resolutions; or (v) relative inexperience of the judiciary and courts in such matters. In Guinea and certain other jurisdictions, the commitment of local business people, government officials and agencies and the judicial system to abide by legal requirements and negotiated agreements may be more uncertain, creating particular concerns with respect to the Concession or other licenses, permits or approvals required by us for the operation of our business, which may be susceptible to revision or cancellation, and legal redress may be uncertain or delayed. There can be no assurance that joint ventures, licenses, license applications or other legal arrangements will not be adversely affected by the actions of government authorities or others, and the effectiveness of and enforcement of such arrangements in these jurisdictions cannot be assured.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nUncertainties and our present capital resources, absent a cash inflow, create substantial doubt we can continue as a going concern. If we do not obtain additional financing, we could be forced to curtail operations.\nDue to uncertainties related to the cost, pendency and ultimate outcome of legal proceedings and the costs and outcome of any ultra-deep water exploration well to be drilled, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we could be unable to continue exploration and execute our business plan, and we could be forced to curtail operations.\nThe price of our common stock historically has been volatile. This volatility may affect the price at which you could sell your common stock, and the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nThe closing price for our common stock has varied between a high of $1.98 on November 3, 2015 and a low of $0.36 on June 29, 2016 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. On September 16, 2016, the closing price of our common stock was $1.14. This volatility may affect the price at which an investor could sell the common stock, and the sale of substantial amounts of our common stock could\nadversely affect the price of our common stock. Our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the other factors discussed in \"-Risks Relating to Our Business and the Industry in Which We Operate\"; variations in our quarterly operating results from our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors; downward revisions in securities analysts' estimates; and announcement by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments.\nOur common stock was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") on March 10, 2015 and we began trading on the OTCQX market on March 11, 2015. Delisting from the NYSE has limited the liquidity of our common stock, and hinders our ability to raise additional capital as well as having other negative results.\nOur common stock was delisted from the NYSE in March 2015 due to our failure to satisfy the NYSE's continued listing criteria. Our common stock is now traded on the OTCQX which is a less prestigious and less active marketplace. Accordingly, liquidity in the trading of our common stock is limited, which could limit the ability of shareholders to sell securities in the secondary market and limit our ability to raise funds.\nTrading on an over-the-counter quotation system could adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through public or private sales of equity securities and could also have other negative results, including the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock in the future, which could adversely affect the market price of our shares and cause dilution to existing stockholders.\nWe will seek to raise funds through a variety of means and plan to issue additional shares of our common stock in the future which could adversely affect the market price of our shares. Significant sales of shares of our common stock by major stockholders, or the public perception that an offering or sale may occur also could have an adverse effect on the market price of shares of our common stock. Issuance of additional shares of common stock will dilute the percentage ownership interest of the existing stockholders, and may dilute the book value per share of our shares of common stock held by existing stockholders.\nSales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market could harm the market price of the shares of common stock.\nThe sale of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock (including shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants to purchase shares) may cause substantial fluctuations in the price of shares of our common stock. Because investors may be more reluctant to purchase shares of our common stock following substantial sales or issuances, the sale of shares in an offering could impair our ability to raise capital in the near term.\nDelaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could adversely impact the market price of our shares.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. Certain provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 90687, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "HDYNQ"}
