RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities is subject to risks inherent in our business and the industry in which we operate. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and all other information included in this report. The risks described below may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition to these risks and the other risks and uncertainties described in Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Forward Looking Statements,\u201d and Item 7, \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. The value or market price of our securities could decline due to any of these identified or other risks. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.\nOur future growth and success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in a highly competitive environment\nWe face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of different competitors. Our future growth and success will depend on our ability to compete effectively in this highly competitive environment. To date, our competitive strategies have focused on attracting deposits in our local markets, and growing our loan and lease portfolio by emphasizing specific loan products in which we have significant experience and expertise, identifying and targeting markets in which we believe we can effectively compete with larger institutions and other competitors, and offering highly competitive pricing to commercial borrowers with low risk profiles. We compete for loans, leases, deposits and other financial services with other commercial banks, thrifts, credit unions, brokerage houses, mutual funds, insurance companies, real estate conduits, mortgage brokers and specialized finance companies. Many of our competitors offer products and services that we do not offer, and many have substantially greater resources and lending limits, name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans, leases and deposits more aggressively than we do, and because of their larger capital bases, their underwriting practices for smaller loans may be subject to less regulatory scrutiny than they would be for smaller banks. Newer competitors may be more aggressive in pricing loans, leases and deposits in order to increase their market share. Some of the financial institutions and financial services organizations with which we compete are not subject to the extensive regulations imposed on federal savings banks and their holding companies. As a result, these nonbank competitors have certain advantages over us in accessing funding and in providing various financial services.\nNumerous factors could adversely impact future loan growth and thus our future profitability\nOur future profitability will depend in substantial part on our ability to achieve loan and lease growth under intensely competitive conditions in a manner consistent with our underwriting standards and business plan objectives. Our ability to achieve future loan and lease growth will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to offer loan and lease products at prices and with features that are comparable or superior to those offered by our competitors and attractive to potential borrowers. Because our business plan targets high quality loans and leases in specific markets and product categories, our underwriting standards and our lending requirements relating to collateral eligibility, residual equity, global debt service coverage, loan covenants, loan structure and financial reporting tend to be on the conservative side of the market. This can make it difficult for us to compete with institutions that have comparable loan pricing but more lenient lending requirements. Our loan pricing is also impacted in a significant way by the financial strength of the borrower, the guarantor and the collateral. This enables us to compete effectively for highly qualified borrowers, but it can place us at a competitive disadvantage with respect to borrowers who present acceptable credit risks but are not highly qualified. Our ability to achieve future loan and lease growth will also be affected by factors that are not exclusively within our control, such as the level of loan payoffs and regulatory charter limits and concentrations of credit limits. These and other factors could weaken our competitive position, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability. This, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nHistorically low interest rates could continue to adversely affect our net interest income and profitability\nOur consolidated operating results are largely dependent on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest expense incurred on deposits and other borrowings. Our net interest income is impacted by changes in market rates of interest, changes in credit spreads, changes in the shape of the yield curve, the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities, prepayments on our loan, leases and investments, and the mix of our funding sources and assets, among other things.\nIn recent years it has been the policy of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to maintain interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of securities. As a result, the interest rates on new loans we have originated and maturing loans that we have renewed and the yields on securities we have purchased during this period have been at historically low levels. Our ability to offset this by lowering the interest rates that we pay on deposits is\nseverely limited because interest rates on deposits are already at historic lows. Accordingly, our net interest income (the difference between interest income earned on assets and interest expense paid on liabilities) may decrease, which may have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nChanges in market interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations\nOur financial condition and results of operations are significantly affected by changes in market interest rates because our assets, primarily loans and leases, and our liabilities, primarily deposits, are monetary in nature. Our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense that we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. Market interest rates are affected by many factors beyond our control, including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, domestic and international events, and changes in the United States and other financial markets. Our net interest income is affected not only by the level and direction of interest rates, but also by the shape of the yield curve and relationships between interest sensitive instruments and key driver rates, including credit risk spreads, and by balance sheet growth, customer loan and deposit preferences and the timing of changes in these variables which themselves are impacted by changes in market interest rates. As a result, changes in market interest rates can significantly affect our net interest income as well as the fair market valuation of our assets and liabilities, particularly if they occur more quickly or to a greater extent than anticipated.\nWhile we take measures intended to manage the risks from changes in market interest rates, we cannot control or accurately predict changes in market rates of interest or be sure that our protective measures are adequate. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other interest earning assets, our net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. We would also incur a higher cost of funds to retain our deposits in a rising interest rate environment. While the higher payment amounts we would receive on adjustable rate loans in a rising interest rate environment may increase our interest income, some borrowers may be unable to afford the higher payment amounts, and this could result in a higher rate of default. Rising interest rates also may reduce the demand for loans and the value of fixed-rate investment securities.\nA substantial portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate. Deterioration in the real estate markets could lead to higher provisions for loan losses, which could have a material negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations\nA substantial portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate. At December 31, 2015, our loan portfolio included $506.0 million in multi-family mortgage loans, or 40.8% of total loans, $226.7 million in nonresidential real estate loans, or 18.3% of total loans, and $159.5 million in one-to-four family residential real estate loans, or 12.9% of total loans (which includes $44.5 million in non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential real estate loans, or 3.6% of total loans). Adverse economic conditions and increased levels of unemployment in any of the selected markets in which we make multifamily loans and in the Chicago market with respect to commercial real estate loans and one-to-four family residential loans could cause us to experience higher levels of defaults, charge-offs, loan classifications and provisions for loan losses on our real estate loans and write-downs on our other real estate owned.\nAdverse changes in local economic conditions and adverse conditions in an industry on which a local market in which we do business depends could hurt our business in a material way\nExcept for our lease and healthcare lending activities, which we conduct on a nationwide basis, and our multi-family lending activities, which we conduct in selected Metropolitan Statistical Areas, including the Metropolitan Statistical Areas for Chicago, Illinois, Dallas, Texas, Denver, Colorado, Tampa, Florida and Minneapolis, Minnesota, our loan and deposit activities are generally conducted in the Metropolitan Statistical Area for Chicago, Illinois. Our loan and deposit activities are directly affected by, and our financial success depends on, economic conditions within the local markets in which we do business, as well as conditions in the industries on which those markets are economically dependent. A deterioration in local economic conditions or in the condition of an industry on which a local market depends could adversely affect such factors as unemployment rates, business formations and expansions, housing demand, apartment vacancy rates and real estate values in the local market, and this could result in, among other things, a decline in loan and lease demand, a reduction in the number of creditworthy borrowers seeking loans, an increase in loan delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures, an increase in classified and nonaccrual loans, a decrease in the value of the collateral for our loans, and a decline in the net worth and liquidity of our borrowers and guarantors. Any of these factors could hurt our business in a material way.\nThe City of Chicago and the State of Illinois have experienced significant financial difficulties, and this could adversely impact certain borrowers and the economic vitality of the City and State\nThe City of Chicago and the State of Illinois are experiencing significant financial difficulties, including material pension funding shortfalls. Their debt ratings have been downgraded and the State of Illinois\u2019 executive and legislative branches of government have been unable to reach agreement on a budget for the current fiscal year. These issues could impact the economic vitality of the City of Chicago and the State of Illinois and the businesses operating there, encourage businesses to leave the City of Chicago and the State of Illinois, and discourage new employers from starting or moving businesses to there. These issues could also result in delays in the payment of accounts receivable owed to borrowers that do business with the State of Illinois and Medicaid payments to nursing homes and other healthcare providers in Illinois, and impair their ability to repay their loans when due.\nRepayment of our commercial and commercial real estate loans typically depends on the cash flows of the borrower. If a borrower's cash flows weaken or become uncertain, the loan may need to be classified, the collateral securing the loan may decline in value and we may need to increase our loan loss reserves or record a charge off\nWe underwrite our commercial and commercial real estate loans primarily based on the historical and expected cash flows of the borrower. Although we consider collateral in the underwriting process, it is a secondary consideration that generally relates to the risk of loss in the event of a borrower default. We follow the OCC's published guidance for assigning risk-ratings to loans, which emphasizes the strength of the borrower's cash flow. Specifically, the OCC's loan risk-rating guidance provides that the primary consideration in assigning risk-ratings to commercial and commercial real estate loans is the strength of the primary source of repayment, which is defined as a sustainable source of cash under the borrower's control that is reserved, explicitly or implicitly, to cover the debt obligation. The OCC's loan risk-rating guidance typically does not consider secondary repayment sources until the strength of the primary repayment source weakens, and collateral values typically do not have a significant impact on a loan's risk ratings until a loan is classified. Consequently, if a borrower's cash flows weaken or become uncertain, the loan may need to be classified, whether or not the loan is performing or fully secured. In addition, real estate appraisers typically place significant weight on the cash flows generated by income-producing real estate and the reliability of the cash flows in performing valuations. Thus, economic or borrower-specific conditions that cause a decline in a borrower's cash flows could cause our loan classifications to increase and the appraised value of the collateral securing our loans to decline, and require us to increase our loan loss reserves or record charge offs.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings would be adversely impacted\nIn the event that our loan customers do not repay their loans according to their terms, and the collateral securing the repayment of these loans is insufficient to cover any remaining loan balance, including expenses of collecting the loan and managing and liquidating the collateral, we could experience significant loan losses or increase our provision for loan losses or both, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. At December 31, 2015, our allowance for loan losses was $9.7 million, which represented 0.78% of total loans and 271.30% of nonperforming loans as of that date. In determining the amount of our allowance for loan losses, we rely on internal and external loan reviews, our experience and our evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors. In addition, we make various estimates and assumptions about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets, if any, serving as collateral for the repayment of our loans. We also make judgments concerning our legal positions and the priority of our liens and interests in contested legal or bankruptcy proceedings, and at times, we may lack sufficient information to establish adequate specific reserves for loans involved in such proceedings. We base these estimates, assumptions and judgments on information that we consider reliable, but if an estimate, assumption or judgment that we make ultimately proves to be incorrect, additional provisions to our allowance for loan losses may become necessary. In addition, as an integral part of their supervisory and/or examination process, the OCC periodically reviews the methodology for and the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses. The OCC has the authority to require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their inclusion, exclusion or modification of risk factors or differences in judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination.\nRepayment of our lease loans is typically dependent on the cash flows of the lessee, which may be unpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value\nWe lend money to small and mid-sized independent leasing companies to finance the debt portion of leases. A lease loan arises when a leasing company discounts the equipment rental revenue stream owed to the leasing company by a lessee. Our lease loans entail many of the same types of risks as our commercial loans. Lease loans generally are non-recourse to the leasing company, and, consequently, our recourse is limited to the lessee and the leased equipment. As with commercial loans secured by equipment, the equipment securing our lease loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value. We rely on the lessee\u2019s continuing financial stability, rather than the value of the leased equipment, for the repayment of all required amounts under lease loans. In the event of a default on a lease loan, the proceeds from the sale of the leased equipment may not be sufficient\nto satisfy the outstanding unpaid amounts under the terms of the loan. At December 31, 2015, our lease loans totaled $265.4 million, or 21.4% of our total loan portfolio.\nOur loan portfolio includes loans to healthcare providers, and the repayment of these loans is largely dependent upon the receipt of governmental reimbursements\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $50.7 million of loans and unused commitments to a variety of healthcare providers, including lines of credit secured by healthcare receivables. The repayment of these lines of credit is largely dependent on the borrower's receipt of payments and reimbursements under Medicaid, Medicare and in some cases private insurance contracts for the services they have provided. The ability of the borrowers to service loans we have made to them may be adversely impacted by the financial health of the state or federal payors, many of which have experienced budgetary stress, to make reimbursements for the services provided. The failure of one or more state or federal payors to make reimbursements owed to the operators of these facilities, or a significant delay in the making of such reimbursements, could adversely affect the ability of the operators of these facilities to repay their obligations to us. In addition, changes to national health care policy involving private health insurance policies may also affect the business prospects and financial condition or operations of commercial loan customers and commercial lessees involved in health care-related businesses.\nNew or changing tax, accounting, and regulatory rules and interpretations could have a significant impact on our strategic initiatives, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition\nThe banking services industry is extensively regulated and the degree of regulation is increasing due to the Dodd-Frank Act and regulatory initiatives precipitated by the Dodd-Frank Act and the most recent economic downturn and the resulting disruptions that certain financial markets experienced. These regulations, along with the currently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, and monetary laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies and interpretations, control the methods by which financial institutions and their holding companies conduct business, engage in strategic and tax planning and implement strategic initiatives, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. These laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time.\nWe are subject to security and operational risks relating to our use of technology, including the risk of cyber-attack or cyber-theft\nCommunications and information systems are essential to the conduct of our business, as we use such systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger and virtually all other aspects of our business. We depend on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our data processing systems, computers, networks and communications systems. Although we take numerous protective measures and otherwise endeavor to protect and maintain the privacy and security of confidential data, these systems may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, other malicious code, cyber-attacks, cyber-theft and other events that could have a security impact. If one or more of such events were to occur, this potentially could jeopardize confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our systems or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our or our customers' operations. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are not fully covered by our insurance. Security breaches in our Internet banking activities could expose us to possible liability and deter customers from using our systems. We rely on standard internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data. These precautions may not fully protect our systems from compromises or breaches of our security measures that could result in damage to our reputation and our business. Although we perform most data processing functions internally, we outsource certain services to third parties. If our third party providers encounter operational difficulties or security breaches, it could affect our ability to adequately process and account for customer transactions, which could significantly affect our business operations.\nOur operations rely on numerous external vendors\nWe rely on numerous external vendors to provide us with products and services necessary to maintain our day-to-day operations. Accordingly, our operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements. The failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements because of changes in the vendor's organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services or strategic focus or for any other reason, could be disruptive to our operations, which in turn could have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. We also could be adversely affected to the extent such an agreement is not renewed by the third party vendor or is renewed on terms less favorable to us.\nOur business and operations could be significantly impacted if we or our third party vendors suffer failure or disruptions of information processing systems, systems failures or security breaches\nWe have become increasingly dependent on communications, data processing and other information technology systems to manage and conduct our business and support our day-to-day banking, investment, and trust activities, some of which are provided through third-parties. If we or our third party vendors encounter difficulties or become the subject of a cyber-attack on or other breach of their operational systems, data or infrastructure, or if we have difficulty communicating with any such third party system, our business and operations could suffer. Any failure or disruption to our systems, or those of a third party vendor, could impede our transaction processing, service delivery, customer relationship management, data processing, financial reporting or risk management. Although we take ongoing monitoring, detection, and prevention measures and perform penetration testing and periodic risk assessments, our computer systems, software and networks and those of our third party vendors may be or become vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious code, or cyber-attacks beyond what we can reasonably anticipate and such events could result in material loss. If any of our financial, accounting or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, we could be materially adversely affected. Security breaches in our online banking systems could also have an adverse effect on our reputation and could subject us to possible liability. Additionally, we could suffer disruptions to our systems or damage to our network infrastructure from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, such as electrical or telecommunications outages, natural disasters, widespread health emergencies or pandemics, or events arising from local or larger scale political events, including terrorist acts. There can be no assurance that our policies, procedures and protective measures designed to prevent or limit the effect of a failure, interruption or security breach, or the policies, procedures and protective measures of our third party vendors, will be effective. If significant failure, interruption or security breaches do occur in our processing systems or those of our third party providers, we could suffer damage to our reputation, a loss of customer business, additional regulatory scrutiny, or exposure to civil litigation, additional costs and possible financial liability. In addition, our business is highly dependent on our ability to process, record and monitor, on a continuous basis, a large number of transactions. To do so, we are dependent on our employees and therefore, the potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our organization, including losses resulting from human error. We could be materially adversely affected if one or more of our employees cause a significant operational breakdown or failure. If we fail to maintain adequate infrastructure, systems, controls and personnel relative to our size and products and services, our ability to effectively operate our business may be impaired and our business could be adversely affected.\nWe continually encounter technological change, and may have fewer resources than many of our competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. We also may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers.\nConsumers and businesses are increasingly using non-banks to complete their financial transactions, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations\nTechnology and other changes are allowing consumers and businesses to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods. For example, the wide acceptance of Internet-based commerce has resulted in a number of alternative payment processing systems and lending platforms in which banks play only minor roles. Customers can now maintain funds in prepaid debit cards or digital currencies, and pay bills and transfer funds directly without the direct assistance of banks. The diminishing role of banks as financial intermediaries has resulted and could continue to result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits. The loss of these revenue streams and the potential loss of lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bank is subject to limits on certain types of commercial lending, which restricts our ability to grow our commercial loan portfolio and diversify our overall loan portfolio\nUnder the Home Owners Loan Act, the Bank may originate, invest in, sell or purchase unlimited loans on the security of residential real estate, while loans on nonresidential real estate generally may not, on a combined basis, exceed 400% of the Bank\u2019s total capital. In addition, secured and unsecured commercial loans and certain types of commercial personal property leases may not\nexceed 20% of the Bank\u2019s assets; however, amounts in excess of 10% of assets may only be used for small business loans. Further, the Bank may generally invest up to 35% of its assets in consumer loans, corporate debt securities and commercial paper on a combined basis. The Bank may invest up to 10% of its assets in tangible personal property, for rental or sale. Certain leases on tangible personal property are not aggregated with commercial or consumer loans for the purposes of determining compliance with the limitations set forth for those investment categories. These limitations limit our ability to grow our commercial loan portfolio and diversify our overall loan portfolio.\nNew lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks\nFrom time to time, we may seek to implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business in our current markets or new markets. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible, which could in turn have a material negative effect on our operating results.\nOur sources of funds are limited because of our holding company structure\nThe Company is a separate legal entity from its subsidiaries and does not have significant operations of its own. Dividends from the Bank provide a significant source of cash for the Company. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. Under these statutes and regulations, the Bank is not permitted to pay dividends on its capital stock to the Company, its sole stockholder, if the dividend would reduce the stockholders' equity of the Bank below the amount of the liquidation account established in connection with the mutual-to-stock conversion. Federal savings banks may pay dividends without the approval of its primary federal regulator only if they meet applicable regulatory capital requirements before and after the payment of the dividends and total dividends do not exceed net income to date over the calendar year plus its retained net income over the preceding two years. Although the Bank's capital exceeded applicable regulatory requirements at December 31, 2015, the Bank did not have sufficient net income over the preceding two years to pay a dividend to the Company without receiving prior regulatory approval. The Company has also reserved $5.0 million of its available cash to maintain its ability to serve as a source of financial strength to the Bank. If in the future, the Company utilizes its available cash for other purposes and the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, the Company may not have sufficient funds to pay dividends.\nFDIC deposit insurance costs have increased and may increase further in the future\nFDIC insurance rates have increased significantly, and we may pay higher FDIC deposit premiums in the future. The Dodd-Frank Act established 1.35% as the minimum Designated Reserve Ratio (\u201cDRR\u201d) for the deposit insurance fund. The FDIC has determined that the DRR should be 2.0% and has adopted a plan under which it will meet the statutory minimum DRR of 1.35% by the statutory deadline of September 30, 2020. The Dodd-Frank Act also required the FDIC to base deposit insurance premiums on an institution's total assets minus its tangible equity instead of its deposits. The FDIC has adopted final regulations that base assessments for banks and thrifts on a combination of financial ratios and regulatory ratings. The FDIC also revised the assessment schedule and established adjustments that increase assessments so that the range of assessments is now 2.5 basis points to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. If there are any changes in the Bank\u2019s financial ratios and regulatory ratings that require adjustments that increase its assessment, or, if circumstances require the FDIC to impose additional special assessments or further increase its quarterly assessment rates, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe will become subject to more stringent capital requirements, which could adversely impact our return on equity, require us to raise additional capital, or constrain us from paying dividends or repurchasing shares\nIn July 2013, the federal banking agencies approved a new rule that substantially amends the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bank and the Company. The final rule implements the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective for us on January 1, 2015, and refines the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements will be: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also requires unrealized gains and losses on certain \u201cavailable-for-sale\u201d securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-out is exercised. The Bank exercised this one-time opt-out option. The final rule also establishes a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5%, and will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The phase in of the new capital conservation buffer requirement began in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted\nassets and would increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.\nWe have analyzed the effects of these new capital requirements, and as of December 31, 2015 we believe that the Bank and the Company met all of these new requirements, including the full 2.5% capital conservation buffer.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models, and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk-based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying its business strategy, and could limit our ability to make distributions, including paying out dividends or buying back shares. Specifically, beginning in 2016, the Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends will be limited if it does not have the capital conservation buffer required by the new capital rules, which may limit our ability to pay dividends to stockholders. See \u201cSupervision and Regulation-Federal Banking Regulation-New Capital Rule.\u201d\nThe residential loans in our loan portfolio are sensitive to regional and local economic conditions\nWe originate fixed and adjustable rate loans secured by one-to-four family residential real estate. Our general practice is to sell a majority of our newly originated fixed-rate residential real estate loans and to hold in portfolio a limited number of adjustable-rate residential real estate loans. Our portfolio also includes home equity lines of credit and fixed-rate second mortgage loans. Residential real estate lending is sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations, making loss levels difficult to predict. Residential loans with high combined loan-to-value ratios generally are more sensitive to declining property values than those with lower combined loan-to-value ratios and therefore may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses. In addition, if the borrowers sell their homes, the borrowers may be unable to repay their loans in full from the sale proceeds. As a result, these loans may experience higher rates of delinquencies, defaults and losses, which could in turn adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent regulations could restrict our ability to originate and sell residential loans\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has issued a rule designed to clarify for lenders how they can avoid legal liability under the Dodd-Frank Act, which would hold lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a mortgage. Loans that meet this \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d definition will be presumed to have complied with the ability-to-repay standard. Under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2019s rule, a \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d loan must not contain certain specified features, including:\n\u2022\nexcessive up-front points and fees (those exceeding 3% of the total loan amount, less \u201cbona fide discount points\u201d for prime loans);\n\u2022\ninterest-only payments;\n\u2022\nnegative-amortization; and\n\u2022\nterms longer than 30 years.\nAlso, to qualify as a \u201cqualified mortgage,\u201d a borrower\u2019s total monthly debt-to-income ratio may not exceed 43%. Lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify the borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments.\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the regulatory agencies to issue regulations that require securitizers of loans to retain not less than 5% of the credit risk for any asset that is not a \u201cqualified residential mortgage.\u201d The regulatory agencies have issued a final rule to implement this requirement, which provides that the definition of \u201cqualified residential mortgage\u201d is the same as the definition of \u201cqualified mortgage\u201d issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for purposes of its regulations. These final rules could have a significant effect on the secondary market for loans and the types of loans we originate, and restrict our ability to make loans, any of which could limit our growth or profitability.\nTrading activity in the Company's common stock could result in material price fluctuations\nIt is possible that trading activity in the Company's common stock, including short-selling or significant sales by our larger stockholders, could result in material price fluctuations of the price per share of the Company's common stock. In addition, such trading activity and the resultant volatility could make it more difficult for the Company to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price it deems appropriate, or to use its stock as consideration for an acquisition.\nVarious factors may make takeover attempts that you might want to succeed more difficult to achieve, which may affect the value of shares of our common stock\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, federal regulations, Maryland law and various other factors may make it more difficult for companies or persons to acquire control of the Company without the consent of our board of directors. You may want a takeover attempt to succeed because, for example, a potential acquirer could offer a premium over the then prevailing price of our shares of common stock. Provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws also may make it difficult to remove our current board of directors or management if our board of directors opposes the removal. We have elected to be subject to the Maryland Business Combination Act, which places restrictions on mergers and other business combinations with large stockholders. In addition, our articles of incorporation provide that certain mergers and other similar transactions, as well as amendments to our articles of incorporation, must be approved by stockholders owning at least two-thirds of our shares of common stock entitled to vote on the matter unless first approved by at least two-thirds of the number of our authorized directors, assuming no vacancies. If approved by at least two-thirds of the number of our authorized directors, assuming no vacancies, the action must still be approved by a majority of our shares entitled to vote on the matter. In addition, a director can be removed from office, but only for cause, if such removal is approved by stockholders owning at least two-thirds of our shares of common stock entitled to vote on the matter. However, if at least two-thirds of the number of our authorized directors, assuming no vacancies, approves the removal of a director, the removal may be with or without cause, but must still be approved by a majority of our voting shares entitled to vote on the matter. Additional provisions include limitations on the voting rights of any beneficial owners of more than 10% of our common stock. Our bylaws, which can only be amended by the board of directors, also contain provisions regarding the timing, content and procedural requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations.\nNon-Compliance with USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions\nFinancial institutions are required under the USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money-laundering and terrorist activities. Financial institutions are also obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network if such activities are detected. These rules also require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure or the inability to comply with these regulations could result in fines or penalties, curtailment of expansion opportunities, intervention or sanctions by regulators and costly litigation or expensive additional controls and systems. During the last few years, several banking institutions have received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. In addition, the U.S. Government imposed and will continue to expand laws and regulations relating to residential and consumer lending activities that create significant new compliance burdens and financial risks. We have developed policies and continue to augment procedures and systems designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations, but these policies may not be effective to provide such compliance.", "PERMNO": 90718, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "BFIN"}
