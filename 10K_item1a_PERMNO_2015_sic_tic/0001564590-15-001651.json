{"cik": "1581091", "company": "RE/MAX Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRE/MAX Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour\u201d or \u201cus\u201d) could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties. An investment in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto before making an investment decision. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and prospects may be materially and adversely affected. As a result, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline and you could lose some or all of your investment.\nWe have grouped our risks according to:\n\u00b7\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry;\n\u00b7\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure; and\n\u00b7\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe residential real estate market is cyclical and we are negatively impacted by downturns in this market and general global economic conditions.\nThe residential real estate market tends to be cyclical and typically is affected by changes in general economic conditions which are beyond our control. These conditions include short-term and long-term interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets, levels of unemployment, consumer confidence and the general condition of the U.S. and the global economy. The residential real estate market also depends upon the strength of financial institutions, which are sensitive to changes in the general macroeconomic and regulatory environment. Lack of available credit or lack of confidence in the financial sector could impact the residential real estate market, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor example, the U.S. residential real estate market has shown signs of recovery in recent years after having been in a significant and prolonged downturn, which began in the second half of 2005. Due to the cyclicality of the real estate market, we cannot predict whether the recovery will continue or if and when the market and related economic forces will return the U.S. residential real estate industry to a period of sustained growth. If the residential real estate market or the economy as a whole does not continue to improve, we may experience adverse effects on our business, financial condition and liquidity, including our ability to access capital and grow our business.\nAny of the following could cause a decline in the housing market and have a material adverse effect on our business by causing periods of lower growth or a decline in the number of home sales and/or home prices which, in turn, could adversely affect our revenue and profitability:\n\u00b7\nan increase in the unemployment rate;\n\u00b7\na decrease in the affordability of homes due to changes in interest rates, home sale prices, and rates of wage and job growth;\n\u00b7\nslow economic growth or recessionary conditions;\n\u00b7\nweak credit markets;\n\u00b7\na low level of consumer confidence in the economy and/or the residential real estate market;\n\u00b7\ninstability of financial institutions;\n\u00b7\nlegislative, tax or regulatory changes that would adversely impact the residential real estate market, including but not limited to potential reform relating to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other government sponsored entities (\u201cGSEs\u201d) that provide liquidity to the U.S. housing and mortgage markets;\n\u00b7\nincreasing mortgage rates and down payment requirements and/or constraints on the availability of mortgage financing, including but not limited to the potential impact of various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) or other legislation and regulations that may be promulgated thereunder relating to mortgage financing, including restrictions imposed on mortgage originators as well as retention levels required to be maintained by sponsors to securitize certain mortgages;\n\u00b7\nexcessive or insufficient regional home inventory levels;\n\u00b7\nhigh levels of foreclosure activity, including but not limited to the release of homes already held for sale by financial institutions;\n\u00b7\nadverse changes in local or regional economic conditions;\n\u00b7\nthe inability or unwillingness of homeowners to enter into home sale transactions due to negative equity in their existing homes;\n\u00b7\na decrease in family formations;\n\u00b7\na decrease in immigration;\n\u00b7\nlocal, state and federal government laws or regulations that burden residential real estate transactions or ownership, including but not limited to changes in the tax laws, such as potential limits on, or elimination of, the deductibility of certain mortgage interest expense, the application of the alternative minimum tax, and real property taxes and employee relocation expense;\n\u00b7\na decrease in home ownership rates, declining demand for real estate and changing social attitudes toward home ownership; and/or\n\u00b7\nacts of nature, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and other natural disasters that disrupt local or regional real estate markets.\nThe failure of the U.S. residential real estate market recovery to be sustained or a prolonged decline in the number of home sales and/or home sale prices could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nThe U.S. residential real estate market has shown signs of recovery after having been in a significant and prolonged downturn, which began in the second half of 2005. However, we do not know if this recovery will continue in the future or if and when the market and related economic forces will return the U.S. residential real estate industry to a period of sustained growth. A lack of a continued recovery or a prolonged decline in existing home sales, a decline in home sale prices or a decline in commission rates charged by our franchisees/brokers could adversely affect our results of operations by reducing the recurring fees we receive from our franchisees, our agents and our company-owned brokerages and reduce the management fees charged by our company-owned brokerages.\nA lack of financing for homebuyers in the U.S. residential real estate market at favorable rates and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations.\nOur business is significantly impacted by the availability of financing at favorable rates or on favorable terms for homebuyers, which may be affected by government regulations and policies. Certain potential reforms such as the U.S. federal government\u2019s conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, proposals to reform the U.S. housing market, attempts to increase loan modifications for homeowners with negative equity, monetary policy of the U.S. government, any rising interest rate environment and the Dodd-Frank Act may adversely impact the housing industry, including homebuyers\u2019 ability to finance and purchase homes.\nThe monetary policy of the U.S. government, and particularly the Federal Reserve Board, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the U.S., significantly affects the availability of financing at favorable rates and on favorable terms, which in turn affects the domestic real estate market. Policies of the Federal Reserve Board can affect interest rates available to potential homebuyers. Further, we are affected by any rising interest rate environment. Changes in the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s policies, the interest rate environment and mortgage market are beyond our control, are difficult to predict and could restrict the availability of financing on reasonable terms for homebuyers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, the possibility of the elimination of the mortgage interest deduction could have an adverse effect on the housing market by reducing incentives for buying or refinancing homes and negatively affecting property values.\nIn addition, the reduction in government support for home financing, including the possible winding down of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, further reduces the availability of financing for homebuyers in the U.S. residential real estate market. In connection with the U.S. federal government\u2019s conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, it has provided billions of dollars of funding to these entities in the form of preferred stock investments to backstop shortfalls in their capital requirements. The U.S. Treasury has indicated it may accelerate the winding down of these entities, but no consensus has emerged in Congress concerning a successor, if any. Given the current uncertainty with respect to the current and further potential reforms relating to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we cannot predict either the short or long term effects of such regulation and its impact on homebuyers\u2019 ability to finance and purchase homes. In an effort to assist recovery of the housing market, the U.S. government has also attempted to increase loan modifications for homeowners with negative equity, but there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective.\nFurthermore, in the wake of the recent downturn in the housing industry, many lenders have significantly tightened their underwriting standards, and many subprime and other alternative mortgage products are no longer common in the marketplace. If these trends continue and mortgage loans continue to be difficult to obtain, including in the jumbo mortgage markets, the ability and willingness of prospective buyers to finance home purchases or to sell their existing homes will be adversely affected, which will adversely affect our operating results.\nDue to diminished cash reserves, the Federal Housing Administration (\u201cFHA\u201d) has, in recent years, been increasing mortgage insurance premium and loan guarantee fees. This has likely contributed to a significant decline in FHA loan applications. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the guarantors of many home loans, have considered similar fee increases. If implemented, such increases could lead to lower demand for certain mortgages, which could have a negative effect on our operating results.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, which was passed to more closely regulate the financial services industry, created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d), an independent federal bureau, which enforces consumer protection laws, including mortgage finance. The Dodd-Frank Act also established new standards and practices for mortgage originators, including determining a prospective borrower\u2019s ability to repay their mortgage, removing incentives for higher cost mortgages, prohibiting prepayment penalties for non-qualified mortgages, prohibiting mandatory arbitration clauses, requiring additional disclosures to potential borrowers and restricting the fees that mortgage originators may collect. Rules enacted under the Dodd Frank Act relating to borrowers\u2019 ability to repay loans took effect in January 2014. These rules create protection from liability for mortgages that meet the requirements for \u201cqualified mortgages.\u201d The rules place several restrictions on qualified mortgages, including caps on certain closing costs. These rules and other rules promulgated by the CFPB could have a significant impact on the availability of home mortgages. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act contained provisions that require GSEs, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to retain an interest in the credit risk arising from the assets they securitize. This may serve to reduce GSEs\u2019 interest in or demand for mortgage loans, which could have a material adverse effect on the mortgage industry, which may reduce the availability of mortgages to certain borrowers.\nWhile we are continuing to evaluate all aspects of the current state of legislation, regulations and policies affecting the domestic real estate market, we cannot predict whether or not such legislation, regulation and policies may result in increased down payment requirements, increased mortgage costs, and result in increased costs and potential litigation for housing market participants, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may fail to successfully execute our strategies to grow our business, including increasing our agent count, expanding our network of franchises and agents, pursuing reacquisitions of the regional franchise rights in a number of RE/MAX regions in the U.S. and Canada and increasing franchise and agent fees, or we may fail to manage our growth effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on our brand, our financial performance and results of operations.\nWe intend to pursue a number of different strategies to grow our revenue and earnings. However, we may not be able to successfully execute these strategies. Based on our experience, we believe gradually improving market conditions in the U.S. will enable us to sell more franchises and recruit and retain higher numbers of agents, increasing our revenue and profitability. As the housing market recovery continues, we expect the growth in our agent count to continue. However, competition for qualified and effective agents is intense, and we may be unable to recruit and retain enough qualified and effective agents to satisfy our growth strategies.\nAn additional key growth strategy is to expand our network of franchises and agents in the U.S., Canada and globally. However, we may face many challenges in adding franchises and attracting agents in new and existing markets, such as:\n\u00b7\nselection and availability of suitable markets;\n\u00b7\nfinding qualified franchisees in these markets who are interested in opening franchises on terms that are favorable to us;\n\u00b7\nsignificant competition in new and existing markets;\n\u00b7\nincreasing our local brand awareness in new markets;\n\u00b7\nattracting and training of qualified local agents;\n\u00b7\nimpact of inclement weather, natural disasters and other acts of nature; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic and business conditions.\nWe are also pursuing a key growth strategy of reacquiring select RE/MAX independent regional franchises in the U.S. and Canada. The reacquisition of a regional franchise increases our revenue and provides an opportunity for us to drive enhanced profitability. This growth strategy depends on our ability to find regional franchisees willing to sell the franchise rights in their regions on favorable terms and to finance and complete these transactions. While we intend to conduct due diligence and implement controls and procedures as we integrate a reacquired region, we may not be able to achieve the expected returns on our acquisition.\nIntegrating acquired regions involves complex operational and personnel-related challenges and we may encounter higher than expected integration costs associated with the reacquisitions of Independent Regions.\nFuture acquisitions may present similar challenges and difficulties, including:\n\u00b7\nthe possible departure of a significant number of key employees;\n\u00b7\nregulatory constraints and costs of executing our growth strategy may vary by geography;\n\u00b7\nthe possible defection of franchisees and agents to other brands or independent real estate companies;\n\u00b7\nthe disruption of our respective ongoing business;\n\u00b7\nproblems we may discover post-closing with the operations, including the internal controls and procedures of the regions we reacquire;\n\u00b7\nthe failure to maintain important business relationships and contracts of the selling region;\n\u00b7\nimpairment of acquired assets;\n\u00b7\nunanticipated expenses related to integration; and\n\u00b7\npotential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses.\nA prolonged diversion of management\u2019s attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of any acquired region or region that we may acquire in the future could prevent us from realizing the anticipated cost savings and revenue growth from our acquisitions.\nIn order to successfully expand our business, we must effectively recruit, develop and motivate new franchisees, and we must maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. We may not be able to hire new employees and our franchisees may not be able to recruit new agents necessary to manage our growth quickly enough to meet our needs. If we fail to effectively manage our hiring needs and successfully develop our franchisees, our franchisee and employee morale, productivity and retention could suffer, and our brand and results of operations could be harmed. Effectively managing our potential growth could require significant capital expenditures and place increasing demands on our management. We may not be successful in managing or expanding our operations or in maintaining adequate financial and operating systems and controls. If we do not successfully manage these processes, our brand and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe failure to attract and retain highly qualified franchisees could compromise our ability to pursue our growth strategy.\nOur most important asset is our people, and the success of our franchisees depends largely on the efforts and abilities of franchisees and their agents, which are subject to numerous factors, including the fees or sales commissions they receive, as applicable, and their perception of our brand value. If our franchisees do not continue to recognize or believe in the value proposition we offer with our brand, believe that our franchise fees are too high, or decide not to renew their franchise agreements with us for any other reason, our business may be materially adversely affected. Additionally, if our franchisees fail to attract and retain agents, they may fail to generate the revenue necessary to pay the contractual fees owed to us.\nOur financial results are affected by the ability of our franchisees to attract and retain agents.\nOur financial results are heavily dependent upon the number of agents in our global network. The majority of our revenue is derived from recurring dues paid by our agents and contractual fees paid by our franchisees or regional franchise owners based on the number of agents within the franchisee\u2019s or regional franchise owner\u2019s network. If our franchisees are not able to attract and retain agents, our revenue may decline. In addition, our competitors may attempt to recruit the agents of our franchisees.\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and any failure to maintain, protect and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to grow our business, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition.\nWe have developed a strong brand that we believe has contributed significantly to the success of our business. Maintaining, protecting and enhancing the \u201cRE/MAX\u201d brand is critical to growing our business, particularly in new markets where we have limited brand recognition. If we do not successfully build and maintain a strong brand, our business could be materially harmed. Maintaining and enhancing the quality of our brand may require us to make substantial investments in areas such as marketing, community relations, outreach and employee training. We actively engage in television, print and online advertisements, targeted promotional mailings and email communications, and engage on a regular basis in public relations and sponsorship activities. These investments may be substantial and may not ultimately be successful.\nWe have recently adopted a change in strategy that will focus our advertising efforts in the U.S. on regional and local advertising. As part of this approach, we are in the process of shifting advertising expenditures away from our national advertising fund to our regional advertising funds. We expect this transition to be completed during 2015. In 2016, funds previously allocated to the RE/MAX national advertising fund will be managed and invested by the separate RE/MAX regional advertising funds. These regional advertising funds will continue to be funded by our agents through fees that our brokers collect and pay to the regional advertising funds. Local advertising and promotion campaigns are paid directly by agents and franchisees within their local markets. Our change in strategy to focus on regional and local advertising in the U.S. may not be successful and the decrease of national advertising may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operation in future periods. We are currently evaluating the impact that this change in advertising strategy may have on our future results of operations, if any.\nBrand value can be severely damaged even by isolated incidents, particularly if the incidents receive considerable negative publicity or result in litigation. Some of these incidents may relate to the way we manage our relationship with our franchisees, our growth strategies or the ordinary course of our business or our franchisees\u2019 business. Other incidents may arise from events that are or may be beyond our ability to control and may damage our brand, such as actions taken (or not taken) by one or more franchisees or their employees relating to health, safety, welfare or other matters; litigation and claims; failure to maintain high ethical and social standards for all of our operations and activities; failure to comply with local laws and regulations; and illegal activity targeted at us or others. Our brand value could diminish significantly if any such incidents or other matters erode consumer confidence in us, which may result in a decrease in our total agent count and, ultimately, lower continuing franchise fees and annual dues, which in turn would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nCompetition in the residential real estate franchising business is intense and may adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe generally face strong competition in the residential real estate services business. As a real estate brokerage franchisor, one of our primary assets is our brand name. Upon the expiration of a franchise agreement, a franchisee may choose to renew their franchise with us, operate as an independent broker or to franchise with one of our competitors. Competing franchisors may offer franchises monthly ongoing fees that are lower than those we charge, or that are more attractive in particular market environments. Further, our largest competitors in this industry in the U.S. and Canada include the brands operated by Realogy Holdings, Corp., (which include Coldwell Banker, Century 21, ERA, Sothebys and Better Homes and Gardens, among others), Berkshire Hathaway Home Services, Keller Williams Realty, Inc. and Royal LePage. Some of these companies may have greater financial resources and larger budgets than we do. To remain competitive in the sale of franchises and to retain our existing franchisees at the time of the renewal of their franchise agreements, we may have to reduce the cost of renewals and/or the recurring monthly fees we charge our franchisees. Further, in certain areas, regional and local franchisors provide additional competitive pressure.\nOur company-owned brokerage business operates in the real estate brokerage business, which is highly competitive.\nOur company-owned brokerage business, like that of our franchisees, is generally subject to intense competition. We compete with other national and independent real estate organizations including our franchisees and those of other national real estate franchisors, franchisees of local and regional real estate franchisors, regional independent real estate organizations, discount brokerages, Internet-based brokerages and smaller niche companies competing in local areas. Competition is particularly intense in the densely populated metropolitan areas in which we operate. In addition, in the real estate brokerage industry, new participants face minimal barriers to entry into the market. We also compete for the services of qualified licensed agents, as well as franchisees. The ability of our company-owned brokerage offices to retain agents is generally subject to numerous factors, including the sales commissions they receive and their perception of brand value.\nOur franchisees or agents may become dissatisfied with their relationship with us.\nAlthough we believe our relationship with our franchisees and agents is open and strong, the nature of such relationships can give rise to conflict. For example, franchisees or agents may become dissatisfied with the amount of contractual fees and dues owed under franchise or other applicable arrangements, particularly in the event that we decide to further increase fees and dues. They may disagree with certain network-wide policies and procedures, including policies such as those dictating brand standards or affecting their marketing efforts. They may also be disappointed with any marketing campaigns designed to develop our brand. There are a variety of reasons why our franchisor franchisee relationship can give rise to conflict. If we experience any conflicts with our franchisees on a large scale, our franchisees may file lawsuits against us or they may seek to disaffiliate with us, which could also result in litigation. These events may, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nRegional master and broker franchisees, as independent business operators may, from time to time, disagree with us and our strategies regarding the business or our interpretation of our respective rights and obligations under our franchise and other agreements. This may lead to disputes and we expect such disputes to occur from time to time in the future. To the extent we have such disputes, the attention of our management, regional master franchisees and broker franchisees will be diverted, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur financial results are affected directly by the operating results of franchisees and agents, over whom we do not have direct control.\nOur real estate franchises generate revenue in the form of monthly ongoing fees, including monthly management fees and broker fees (which are tied to agent gross commissions) charged by our franchisees to our agents. Our agents pay us annual dues to have access to our network and utilize our services. Accordingly, our financial results depend upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees and their agents, whom we do not control, particularly in Independent Regions where we exercise less control over franchisees than in Company-owned Regions. If industry trends or economic conditions are not sustained or do not continue to improve, our franchisees\u2019 financial results may worsen and our revenue may decline. We may also have to terminate franchisees more frequently in the future due to non-reporting and non-payment. Further, if franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements, or if we decide to restructure franchise agreements in order to induce franchisees to renew these agreements, then our revenue from ongoing monthly fees may decrease, and profitability from new franchisees may be lower than in the past due to reduced ongoing monthly fees and other non-standard incentives we may need to provide.\nOur franchisees and agents could take actions that could harm our business.\nOur regional franchisees and brokerages are independent businesses and the agents who work with our company-owned brokerage operations are independent contractors and, as such, neither are our employees, and we do not exercise control over their day-to-day operations. Broker franchisees may not operate real estate brokerage businesses in a manner consistent with industry standards, or may not attract and retain qualified independent contractor agents. If broker franchisees and agents were to provide diminished quality of service to customers, our image and reputation may suffer materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAdditionally, broker franchisees and agents may engage or be accused of engaging in unlawful or tortious acts such as violating the anti-discrimination requirements of the Fair Housing Act. Such acts or the accusation of such acts could harm our business and our brand, reputation and goodwill.\nThe failure of Independent Region owners to successfully develop or expand within their respective regions could adversely impact our revenue.\nWe have sold regional master franchises in the U.S. and Canada and have sold and continue to sell regional master franchises in our global locations outside of Canada. While in recent years, we have pursued a strategy to reacquire the regional franchise rights in a number of regions in the U.S., we still rely on independent regional master franchises in Independent Regions, and in all regions located outside the U.S. and Canada. We derive only a limited portion of our revenue directly from master franchises. However, Independent Regions have the right to grant franchises within a particular region. The failure of any of these Independent Region owners to successfully develop or expand within their respective regions could result in the delay of the development of a particular region or an interruption in the operation of our brand in a particular market or markets. Any such delay or interruption would result in a delay in, or loss of, income to us, which would adversely impact our revenue, business and results of operations.\nIn addition, the termination of an agreement with a regional master franchisee could also result in the delay of the development of a franchised area, or an interruption in the operation of our brand in a particular market or markets, while we seek alternative methods to develop our franchises in the area. Such an event could result in lower revenue for us, which would adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a variety of additional risks associated with our franchisees.\nOur franchise system subjects us to a number of risks, any one of which may impact our ability to collect recurring, contractual fees and dues from our franchisees, may harm the goodwill associated with our brand, and/or may materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nBankruptcy of U.S. Franchisees. A franchisee bankruptcy could have a substantial negative impact on our ability to collect fees and dues owed under such franchisee\u2019s franchise arrangements. In a franchisee bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee may reject its franchise arrangements pursuant to Section 365 under the U.S. bankruptcy code, in which case there would be no further payments for fees and dues from such franchisee, and there can be no assurance as to the proceeds, if any, that may ultimately be recovered in a bankruptcy proceeding of such franchisee in connection with a damage claim resulting from such rejection.\nFranchisee Insurance. The franchise arrangements require each franchisee to maintain certain insurance types and levels. Certain extraordinary hazards, however, may not be covered, and insurance may not be available (or may be available only at prohibitively expensive rates) with respect to many other risks. Moreover, any loss incurred could exceed policy limits or the franchisee could lack the required insurance at the time the claim arises, in breach of the insurance requirement, and policy payments made to franchisees may not be made on a timely basis. Any such loss or delay in payment could have a material and adverse effect on a franchisee\u2019s ability to satisfy its obligations under its franchise arrangement, including its ability to make payments for contractual fees and dues or to indemnify us.\nFranchise Arrangement Termination; Nonrenewal. Each franchise arrangement is subject to termination by us as the franchisor in the event of a default, generally after expiration of applicable cure periods, although under certain circumstances a franchise arrangement may be terminated by us upon notice without an opportunity to cure. The default provisions under the franchise arrangements are drafted broadly and include, among other things, any failure to meet operating standards and actions that may threaten the licensed intellectual property.\nIn addition, each franchise agreement has an expiration date. Upon the expiration of the franchise arrangement, we or the franchisee may or may not elect to renew the franchise arrangement. If the franchisee arrangement is renewed, such renewal is generally contingent on the franchisee\u2019s execution of the then-current form of franchise arrangement (which may include terms the franchisee deems to be more onerous than the prior franchise agreement), the satisfaction of certain conditions and the payment of a renewal fee. If a franchisee is unable or unwilling to satisfy any of the foregoing conditions, the expiring franchise arrangement will terminate upon expiration of the term of the franchise arrangement.\nWe may experience significant claims relating to our operations and losses resulting from fraud, defalcation, misconduct or negligence of our franchisees or agents.\nFraud, defalcation, misconduct and negligence by employees are risks inherent in our business. We may also, from time to time, be subject to liability claims based upon the fraud, misconduct or negligence of our franchisees and agents. To the extent that any loss or theft of funds substantially exceeds our insurance coverage, our business could be materially adversely affected and divert management\u2019s attention.\nIn addition, we rely on the collection and use of personally identifiable information from franchisees, agents and consumers to conduct our business. We disclose our information collection and dissemination practices in a published privacy statement on our websites, which we may modify from time to time. We may be subject to legal claims, government action and damage to our reputation if we act or are perceived to be acting inconsistently with the terms of our privacy statement, consumer expectations, or the law. In the event we or the vendors with which we contract to provide services on behalf of our customers were to suffer a breach of personally identifiable information, our customers could terminate their business with us. Further, we may be subject to claims to the extent individual employees or independent contractors breach or fail to adhere to company policies and practices and such actions jeopardize any personally identifiable information.\nThe real estate brokerage business is highly regulated and any failure to comply with such regulations or any changes in such regulations could adversely affect our business.\nOur company-owned real estate brokerage business and the businesses of our franchisees are highly regulated and must comply with the requirements governing the licensing and conduct of real estate brokerage and brokerage-related businesses in the jurisdictions in which we and they do business. These laws and regulations contain general standards for and prohibitions on the conduct of real estate brokers and agents, including those relating to licensing of brokers and agents, fiduciary and agency duties, administration of trust funds, collection of commissions, advertising and consumer disclosures. Under state law, the franchisees and our real estate brokers have certain duties to supervise and are responsible for the conduct of their brokerage business.\nOur company-owned real estate brokerage business and the businesses of our franchisees (excluding commercial brokerage transactions) must comply with RESPA. RESPA and comparable state statutes, among other things, restrict payments which real estate brokers, agents and other settlement service providers may receive for the referral of business to other settlement service providers in connection with the closing of real estate transactions. Such laws may to some extent restrict preferred vendor arrangements involving our franchisees and our company-owned brokerage business. RESPA and similar state laws also require timely disclosure of certain relationships or financial interests that a broker has with providers of real estate settlement services. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, administration of RESPA has been moved from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d) to the new CFPB and it is possible that the practice of HUD taking very expansive readings of RESPA will continue or accelerate at the CFPB, which creates an increased regulatory risk.\nThere is a risk that we could be adversely affected by current laws, regulations or interpretations or that more restrictive laws, regulations or interpretations will be adopted in the future that could make compliance more difficult or expensive. There is also a risk that a change in current laws could adversely affect our business or our franchisees\u2019 business.\nRegulatory authorities also have relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations. Accordingly, such regulatory authorities could prevent or temporarily suspend our company-owned brokerages or our franchisees from carrying on some or all of our activities or otherwise penalize them if their financial condition or our practices were found not to comply with the then current regulatory or licensing requirements or any interpretation of such requirements by the regulatory authority. Our failure to comply with any of these requirements or interpretations could limit our ability to renew current franchisees or sign new franchisees or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe, and our franchisees, are also, to a lesser extent, subject to various other rules and regulations such as:\n\u00b7\nthe Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act which governs the disclosure and safeguarding of consumer financial information;\n\u00b7\nvarious state and federal privacy laws protecting consumer data;\n\u00b7\nthe USA PATRIOT Act;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on transactions with persons on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons list promulgated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Department of the Treasury;\n\u00b7\nfederal and state \u201cDo Not Call,\u201d \u201cDo Not Fax,\u201d and \u201cDo Not E-Mail\u201d laws;\n\u00b7\nthe Fair Housing Act;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with Affiliated Business Agreement regulations;\n\u00b7\nlaws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, that impose sanctions on improper payments;\n\u00b7\nlaws and regulations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which we do business;\n\u00b7\nstate and federal employment laws and regulations, including any changes that would require classification of independent contractors to employee status, and wage and hour regulations;\n\u00b7\nincreases in state, local or federal taxes that could diminish profitability or liquidity; and\n\u00b7\nconsumer fraud statutes that are broadly written.\nOur failure to comply with any of the foregoing laws and regulations may subject us to fines, penalties, injunctions and/or potential criminal violations. Any changes to these laws or regulations or any new laws or regulations may make it more difficult for us to operate our business and may have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for so long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nUnder the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act until we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until the end of our 2018 fiscal year.\nBecause we have not yet engaged an independent registered public accounting firm to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, we cannot conclude that such an audit would not uncover a material weakness in our internal controls or a combination of significant deficiencies that could result in the conclusion that we have a material weakness in our internal controls. Under rules of the SEC, a material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We cannot assure you that material weaknesses will not be identified in the future.\nIf material weaknesses or other deficiencies occur in the future, or if we fail to fully maintain effective internal controls in the future, it could result in a material misstatement of our financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, which could require a restatement, cause investors to lose confidence in our financial information or cause our stock price to decline.\nOur franchising activities are subject to a variety of state and federal laws and regulations regarding franchises, and any failure to comply with such existing or future laws and regulations could adversely affect our business.\nThe sale of franchises is regulated by various state laws as well as by the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d). The FTC requires that franchisors make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees but does not require registration. A number of states require registration and/or disclosure in connection with franchise offers and sales. In addition, several states have \u201cfranchise relationship laws\u201d or \u201cbusiness opportunity laws\u201d that limit the ability of franchisors to terminate franchise agreements or to withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these agreements. We believe that our franchising procedures, as well as any applicable state-specific procedures, comply in all material respects with both the FTC guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we offer new franchise arrangements. However, noncompliance could reduce anticipated revenue, which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nMost of our domestic and global regional franchisees self-report their agent counts, agent commissions and fees due to us, and we have limited tools to validate or verify these reports and a few of our domestic and global master franchise agreements do not contain audit rights. If a material number of our regional master franchisees were to under report or erroneously report their agent counts, agent commissions or fees due to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations.\nUnder our regional franchise agreements, owners in our Independent Regions report the number of agents, monthly management fees and broker service fees received by the brokers from the agents and the monthly ongoing fees (continuing franchise fees and broker fees) payable to us by the brokers. Generally, our regional agreements require that the regional franchisee provide us with certain financial reports, including reports that we may reasonably request from time to time. Additionally, many of these agreements also provide us with audit rights. For those agreements that do not, we may have limited methods of validating the monthly ongoing fees due to us from these regions and must rely on reports submitted by such regional franchisees and our internal protocols for verifying agent counts. If such regional franchisees were to under report or erroneously report these amounts payable, even if unintentionally, we may not receive all of the annual agent dues or monthly ongoing fees due to us. In addition, to the extent that we were underpaid, we may not have a definitive method for determining such underpayment. If a material number of our regional franchisees were to under report or erroneously report their agent counts, agent commissions or fees due to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations.\nWe are subject to certain risks related to litigation filed by or against us, and adverse results may harm our business and financial condition.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the costs of defense, the costs of prosecution, insurance coverage or the ultimate outcome of litigation and other proceedings filed by or against us, including remedies or damage awards, and adverse results in such litigation and other proceedings may harm our business and financial condition.\nSuch litigation and other proceedings may include, but are not limited to, complaints from or litigation by franchisees, usually related to alleged breaches of contract or wrongful termination under the franchise arrangements, actions relating to intellectual property, commercial arrangements, franchising arrangements, negligence and fiduciary duty claims arising from franchising arrangements or company-owned brokerage operations, breaches of fiduciary duty by our licensed brokers, standard brokerage disputes like the failure to disclose hidden defects in the property such as mold, vicarious liability based upon conduct of individuals or entities outside of our control, including franchisees and agents, antitrust claims, false advertising claims, general fraud claims and employment law claims, including claims challenging the classification of our agents as independent contractors, violations of state laws relating to business practices or consumer disclosures, and claims alleging violations of RESPA or state consumer fraud statutes. We may also be subject to employee claims based on, among other things, discrimination, harassment or wrongful termination.\nFranchisees are subject to a variety of litigation risks, including, but not limited to, customer claims, personal injury claims, environmental claims, agent allegations of improper termination and discrimination, claims related to violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (\u201cERISA\u201d) and intellectual property claims. Litigation against a franchisee or its affiliates by third parties, whether in the ordinary course of business or otherwise, may include claims against us by virtue of the franchise relationship. In addition to increasing costs and limiting the funds available to pay contractual fees and dues and reducing the execution of new franchise arrangements, such claims divert our management resources and could cause adverse publicity which may materially and adversely affect us and our brand, regardless of whether such allegations are valid or whether we are liable.\nOur global operations may be subject to additional risks related to litigation, including difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations governed by foreign law due to differing interpretations of rights and obligations, compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting laws, new and potentially untested laws and judicial systems and reduced or diminished protection of intellectual property. A substantial unsatisfied judgment against us or one of our subsidiaries could result in bankruptcy, which would materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur global operations, including Canada, are subject to risks not generally experienced by our U.S. operations.\nWe have global regional franchisees and master franchisees. For the year ended December 31, 2014, revenue from these operations represented approximately 19% of our total revenue, of which 14% is from our Canadian operations. Our global operations are subject to risks not generally experienced by our U.S. operations. The risks involved in our global operations and relationships that could result in losses against which we are not insured and therefore affect our profitability include:\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily related to changes in the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rates as well as foreign exchange restrictions;\n\u00b7\nexposure to local economic conditions and local laws and regulations, including those relating to the agents of our franchisees;\n\u00b7\neconomic and/or credit conditions abroad;\n\u00b7\npotential adverse changes in the political stability of foreign countries or in their diplomatic relations with the U.S.;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings;\n\u00b7\ngovernment policies against businesses owned by foreigners;\n\u00b7\ninvestment restrictions or requirements;\n\u00b7\ndiminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in registering, protecting or preserving trade names and trademarks in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the ability to obtain or retain licenses required for operation;\n\u00b7\nincreased franchise regulations in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u00b7\nwithholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in foreign tax laws.\nOur global operations outside Canada generally generate substantially lower average revenue per agent and therefore lower margins than our U.S. and Canadian operations.\nLoss or attrition among our senior management or other key employees or the inability to hire additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations, our brand and our financial performance.\nOur future success is largely dependent on the efforts and abilities of our Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and Co-Founder, David Liniger, our senior management and other key employees. Our former Chief Executive Officer, Margaret Kelly, recently retired and the loss of the services of David Liniger and our other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. In addition, we do not maintain key employee life insurance policies on David Liniger or our other key employees. As a result, we may not be able to cover the financial loss we may incur in losing the services of any of these individuals.\nOur ability to retain our employees is generally subject to numerous factors, including the compensation and benefits we pay, the mix between the fixed and variable compensation we pay our employees and prevailing compensation rates. As such, we could suffer significant attrition among our current key employees. Competition for qualified employees in the real estate franchising industry is intense. We may be unable to retain existing employees that are important to our business or hire additional qualified employees. The process of locating employees with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our goals is often lengthy. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified employees.\nIf we were to lose key employees and not promptly fill their positions with comparably qualified individuals, our business may be materially adversely affected.\nWe only have one primary facility, which serves as our corporate headquarters, and are in the process of implementing business continuity procedures. If we encounter difficulties associated with this facility, we could face management issues that could have a material adverse effect on our business operations.\nWe only have one primary facility, in Denver, Colorado, which serves as our corporate headquarters where most of our employees are located. A significant portion of our computer equipment and senior management, including critical resources dedicated to financial and administrative functions, is also located at our corporate headquarters. Our management and employees would need to find an alternative location if we were to encounter difficulties at our corporate headquarters, including by fire or other natural disaster, which would cause disruption and expense to our business and operations.\nWe recognize the need for, and are in the process of, developing business continuity and document retention plans that would allow us to be operational despite casualties or unforeseen events impacting our corporate headquarters. If we encounter difficulties or disasters at our corporate headquarters without business continuity and document retention plans in place, our operations and information may not be available in a timely manner, or at all, and this would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nInfringement, misappropriation or dilution of our intellectual property could harm our business.\nWe regard our RE/MAX trademark, balloon logo and yard sign design trademarks as having significant value and as being an important factor in the marketing of our brand. We believe that this and other intellectual property are valuable assets that are critical to our success. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, as well as copyright, trademark, and other laws, to protect our intellectual property from infringement, misappropriation or dilution. We have registered certain trademarks and service marks and have other trademark and service mark registration applications pending in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. However, not all of the trademarks or service marks that we currently use have been registered in all of the countries in which we do business, and they may never be registered in all of those countries. Although we monitor trademark portfolios both internally and through external search agents and impose an obligation on franchisees to notify us upon learning of potential infringement, there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately maintain, enforce and protect our trademarks or other intellectual property rights.\nWe are commonly involved in numerous proceedings, generally on a small scale, to enforce our intellectual property and protect our brand. Unauthorized uses or other infringement of our trademarks or service marks, including ones that are currently unknown to us, could diminish the value of our brand and may adversely affect our business. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every market in which we have franchised or intend to franchise. Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could damage our brand and impair our ability to compete effectively. Even where we have effectively secured statutory protection for our trademarks and other intellectual property, our competitors may misappropriate our intellectual property, and in the course of litigation, such competitors occasionally attempt to challenge the breadth of our ability to prevent others from using similar marks or designs. If such challenges were to be successful, less ability to prevent others from using similar marks or designs may ultimately result in a reduced distinctiveness of our brand in the minds of consumers. Defending or enforcing our trademark rights, branding practices and other intellectual property, and seeking an injunction and/or compensation for misappropriation of confidential information, could result in the expenditure of significant resources and divert the attention of management, which in turn may materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. Even though competitors occasionally attempt to challenge our ability to prevent infringers from using our marks, we are not aware of any challenges to our right to use, and to authorize our franchisees to use, any of our brand names or trademarks.\nAlthough we monitor and restrict our franchisees\u2019 activities through our franchise agreements, franchisee noncompliance with the terms and conditions of our franchise agreements and our brand standards may reduce the overall goodwill of our brand, whether through diminished consumer perception of our brand, dilution of our intellectual property, the failure to meet the FTC guidelines or applicable state laws, or through the participation in improper or objectionable business practices. Moreover, unauthorized third parties may use our intellectual property to trade on the goodwill of our brand, resulting in consumer confusion or dilution. Any reduction of our brand\u2019s goodwill, consumer confusion, or dilution is likely to impact sales, and could materially and adversely impact our business and operating results.\nWe are implementing a new information technology infrastructure for certain key aspects of our operations, which may be more costly than anticipated or take more time to complete and integrate than we expect, which could distract our management from our business and have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe are implementing a new information technology infrastructure for certain key aspects of our operations. In the process of designing, developing and integrating such infrastructure, we may experience cost overages, delays or other factors that may distract our management from our business, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nFurther, we may not be able to obtain such new technologies and systems, or to replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as our competitors or in a cost-effective manner. Also, we may not achieve the benefits anticipated or required from any new technology or system, and we may not be able to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems in the future.\nWe rely on traffic to our websites, including our flagship website, remax.com, directed from search engines like Google, Yahoo! and Bing. If our websites fail to rank prominently in unpaid search results, traffic to our websites could decline and our business would be adversely affected.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract users through unpaid Internet search results on search engines like Google, Yahoo! and Bing. The number of users we attract to our websites, including our flagship website, remax.com, from search engines is due in large part to how and where our websites rank in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a number of factors, many of which are not under our direct control, and they may change frequently. For example, a search engine may change its ranking algorithms, methodologies or design layouts. As a result, links to our websites may not be prominent enough to drive traffic to our websites, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to influence the results. In some instances, search engine companies may change these rankings in order to promote their own competing services or the services of one or more of our competitors. Our websites have experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate fluctuations in the future. Any reduction in the number of users directed to our websites could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that our platform is accessible.\nIt is important to our success that users in all geographies be able to access our website at all times. We may experience, in the future, service disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including reliance on our third-party hosted services, infrastructure changes, human or software errors, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our platform simultaneously, and denial of service or fraud or security attacks. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. If our website is unavailable when users attempt to access it or it does not load as quickly as they expect, users may seek other services to obtain the information for which they are looking, and may not return to our website as often in the future, or at all. This would negatively impact our ability to attract customers and decrease the frequency with which they use our website. We expect to continue to make ongoing investments to maintain and improve the availability of our website and to enable rapid releases of new features. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and operating results may be harmed.\nAny disruption or reduction in our information technology capabilities or other threats to our cybersecurity could harm our business.\nOur information technologies and systems and those of our third-party hosted services are vulnerable to breach, damage or interruption from various causes, including: (i) natural disasters, war and acts of terrorism, (ii) power losses, computer systems failure, Internet and telecommunications or data network failures, operator error, losses and corruption of data, and similar events and (iii) computer viruses, penetration by individuals seeking to disrupt operations or misappropriate information and other physical or electronic breaches of security. We may not be able to successfully prevent a disruption to or material adverse effect on our business or operations in the event of a disaster, theft of data or other business interruption. Any extended interruption in our technologies or systems or significant breach could significantly curtail our ability to conduct our business and generate revenue. Additionally, our business interruption insurance may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur.\nA significant increase in private sales of residential property, including through the Internet, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and results of operations.\nA significant increase in the volume of private sales completed without the involvement of a full-service real estate agent or using a low cost provider due to, for example, increased access to the Internet and the proliferation of companies\u2019 websites that facilitate such sales, and a corresponding decrease in the volume of sales through real estate agents could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and results of operations.\nThe terms of RE/MAX, LLC\u2019s senior secured credit facility restrict the current and future operations of RMCO, RE/MAX, LLC and their subsidiaries, which could adversely affect their ability to respond to changes in business and to manage operations.\nRE/MAX, LLC\u2019s senior secured credit facility includes a number of customary restrictive covenants. These covenants could impair the financing and operational flexibility of RMCO, RE/MAX, LLC and their subsidiaries and make it difficult for them to react to market conditions and satisfy their ongoing capital needs and unanticipated cash requirements. Specifically, such covenants may restrict their ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nincur additional debt;\n\u00b7\nmake certain investments, acquisitions and joint ventures;\n\u00b7\nenter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u00b7\npay dividends or make distributions or other payments to us;\n\u00b7\nuse assets as security in certain transactions;\n\u00b7\nrepurchase their equity interests;\n\u00b7\nsell certain assets or merge with or into other companies;\n\u00b7\nguarantee the debts of others;\n\u00b7\nenter into new lines of business; and\n\u00b7\nmake certain payments on subordinated debt.\nIn addition, so long as any revolving loans are outstanding under the senior secured credit facility, RE/MAX, LLC is required to maintain specified financial ratios. As of December 31, 2014, there were no outstanding revolving loans.\nThe ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of the senior secured credit facility will depend on future operating performance of RE/MAX, LLC and its subsidiaries. If RE/MAX, LLC fails to comply with such covenants and terms, it would be required to obtain waivers from the lenders or agree with the lenders to an amendment of the facility\u2019s terms to maintain compliance under the facility. If RE/MAX, LLC is unable to obtain any necessary waivers or amendments and the debt under our senior secured credit facility is accelerated or the lenders bring other remedies, it would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and future operating performance.\nWe have significant debt service obligations and may incur additional indebtedness in the future which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to changes to our business.\nWe have significant debt service obligations, including principal, interest and commitment fee payments due quarterly pursuant to RE/MAX, LLC\u2019s senior secured credit facility. Our currently existing indebtedness, or any additional indebtedness we may incur, could require us to divert funds identified for other purposes for debt service and impair our liquidity position. In 2014, we had total debt service obligations of $11.0 million, excluding our required principal excess cash flow prepayment of $14.6 million made in April 2014 pursuant to the terms of RE/MAX, LLC\u2019s senior secured credit facility. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may need to refinance our debt, dispose of assets or issue additional equity to obtain necessary funds. We do not know whether we will be able to take any of such actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us or at all. Our level of indebtedness has important consequences to you and your investment in our Class A common stock.\nFor example, our level of indebtedness may:\n\u00b7\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our debt, which would reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to pay future dividends;\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans and other investments, which may limit our ability to implement our business strategy;\n\u00b7\nheighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the housing industry or in the general economy and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the housing industry; or\n\u00b7\nprevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise or successfully carrying out our plans to expand our franchise base and product offerings.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make payments on our indebtedness or to fund our operations.\nAs a result of these covenants, we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs.\nFuture indebtedness may impose various additional restrictions and covenants on us which could limit our ability to respond to market conditions, to make capital investments or to take advantage of business opportunities. Our ability to make payments to fund working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, and strategic acquisitions will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nVariable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nAs of December 31, 2014, $211.7 million in term loans were outstanding under our senior secured credit facility, net of unamortized discount, which was at variable rates of interest, thereby exposing us to interest rate risk. We currently do not engage in any interest rate hedging activity and we have no intention to do so in the foreseeable future. As such, if interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our outstanding indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income would decrease.\nOur operating results are subject to quarterly fluctuations, and results for any quarter may not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year.\nHistorically, we have realized, and expect to continue to realize, lower Adjusted EBITDA margins in the first and fourth quarters due primarily to the impact of lower broker fees and other revenue as a result of lower overall home sale transactions, and higher selling, operating and administrative expenses in the first quarter for expenses incurred in connection with our annual convention. Accordingly, our results of operations may fluctuate on a quarterly basis, which would cause period to period comparisons of our operating results to not be necessarily meaningful and cannot be relied upon as indicators of future annual performance.\nChanges in accounting standards, subjective assumptions and estimates used by management related to complex accounting matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and results of operations.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidance and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters, such as revenue recognition, accounting for leases, equity-based compensation, asset impairments, valuation reserves, income taxes and fair value accounting, are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments made by management. Changes in these rules or their interpretations or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments made by management could significantly change our reported results.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur new costs as a result of becoming a public company, and such costs will likely increase when we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, insurance and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. The expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. We expect compliance with these public reporting requirements and associated rules and regulations to increase our legal and financial costs, particularly after we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act reduces certain disclosure requirements for \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d thereby decreasing related regulatory compliance costs and to make some activities less time-consuming and costly. We are currently unable to estimate these costs. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as our executive officers. Further, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our Class A common stock, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and, potentially, civil litigation.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure\nRIHI, Inc. (\u201cRIHI\u201d) has substantial control over us including over decisions that require the approval of stockholders, and its interest in our business may conflict with yours.\nRIHI, an entity controlled by David Liniger, our Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and Co-Founder, and Gail Liniger, our Vice-Chair and Co-Founder, respectively, (with Vincent Tracey, our President, and Daryl Jesperson, a director, who hold minority ownership interests in RIHI), holds a majority of the combined voting power of the different classes of our capital stock through its ownership of 100% of our outstanding Class B common stock. Additionally, the shares of Class B common stock entitle the holder, without regard to the number of shares of Class B common stock held, to a number of votes on matters presented to stockholders of RE/MAX Holdings that is equal to two times the aggregate number of common units of RMCO held by such holder.\nAccordingly, RIHI, acting alone, has the ability to approve or disapprove substantially all transactions and other matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, such as a merger, consolidation, dissolution or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, the issuance or redemption of certain additional equity interests, and the election of directors. These voting and class approval rights may enable RIHI to consummate transactions that may not be in the best interests of holders of our Class A common stock or, conversely, prevent the consummation of transactions that may be in the best interests of holders of our Class A common stock. In addition, although RIHI has voting control of us, RIHI\u2019s entire economic interest in us is in the form of its direct interest in RMCO through the ownership of RMCO common units, the payments it may receive from us under its tax receivable agreement and the proceeds it may receive upon any redemption of its RMCO common units, including issuance of shares of our Class A common stock upon any such redemption and any subsequent sale of such Class A common stock. As a result, RIHI\u2019s interests may conflict with the interests of our Class A common stockholders. For example, RIHI may have a different tax position from us which could influence its decisions regarding whether and when to dispose of assets, whether and when to incur new or refinance existing indebtedness, especially in light of the existence of the tax receivable agreements that we entered into in connection with our IPO, and whether and when we should terminate the tax receivable agreements and accelerate our obligations thereunder. In addition, the structuring of future transactions may take into consideration the tax or other considerations of RIHI and Weston Presidio V., L.P. (collectively, the \u201cHistorical Owners\u201d), even in situations where no similar considerations are relevant to us.\nWe are a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d within the meaning of the NYSE listing requirements and, as a result, qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. You do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such corporate governance requirements.\nBecause of the voting power over our Company held by RIHI, we are considered a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d for the purposes of the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) listing requirements. As such, we are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements, including:\n\u00b7\nthe requirement that the majority of directors on our board be independent;\n\u00b7\nthe requirement that we have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities;\n\u00b7\nthe requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee\u2019s purpose and responsibilities; and\n\u00b7\nthe requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees.\nThe corporate governance requirements and specifically the independence standards are intended to ensure that directors who are considered independent are free of any conflicting interest that could influence their actions as directors. We are utilizing these exemptions afforded to a \u201ccontrolled company.\u201d As a result, the majority of directors on our board is not independent nor do our nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees consist entirely of independent directors. We also are not required to conduct an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees. Accordingly, you do not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the NYSE.\nWe depend on distributions from RMCO to pay taxes and expenses, including payments under the tax receivable agreements, but RMCO\u2019s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions.\nWe have no material assets other than our ownership of common units of RMCO and have no independent means of generating revenue. RMCO is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as such, is not subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, taxable income is allocated to RMCO\u2019s partners, including us. As a result, we incur income taxes on our allocable share of any net taxable income of RMCO and are responsible for complying with U.S. and foreign tax laws. Under the terms of RMCO\u2019s fourth amended and restated limited liability company operating agreement, which became effective upon the completion of our IPO (the \u201cNew RMCO, LLC agreement\u201d), RMCO is obligated to make tax distributions to its members, including us. In addition to tax expenses, we also incur expenses related to our operations and must satisfy obligations under the terms of the tax receivable agreements, which we expect will be significant over the fifteen-year term. As RMCO\u2019s managing member, we cause RMCO to make distributions in an amount sufficient to allow us to pay our taxes and operating expenses, including any payments due under the tax receivable agreements. However, RMCO\u2019s ability to make such distributions may be subject to various limitations and restrictions including, but not limited to, restrictions on distributions that would either violate any contract or agreement to which RMCO is then a party, including debt agreements, or any applicable law, or that would have the effect of rendering RMCO insolvent. If RMCO does not have sufficient funds to pay tax or other liabilities to fund our operations, we may have to borrow funds, which could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition and subject us to various restrictions imposed by any such lenders. To the extent that we are unable to make payments under the tax receivable agreements for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid. If RMCO does not have sufficient funds to make distributions, our ability to declare and pay cash dividends may also be restricted or impaired. See \u201c-Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock.\u201d\nOur tax receivable agreements with our Historical Owners require us to make cash payments to them based upon future tax benefits to which we may become entitled, and the amounts that we may be required to pay could be significant.\nIn connection with our IPO, we entered into tax receivable agreements with our Historical Owners. Refer to \u201cItem 7 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Tax Impact of Reorganization Transactions and IPO\u201d for additional information. The amount of the cash payments that we may be required to make under the tax receivable agreements could be significant and will depend, in part, upon facts and circumstances that are beyond our control. Any payments made by us to our Historical Owners under the tax receivable agreements will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us and the first payments were made on December 31, 2014 and will be made annually thereafter. To the extent that we are unable to make timely payments under the tax receivable agreements for any reason, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid by us. Furthermore, our future obligation to make payments under the tax receivable agreements could make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that may be deemed realized under the tax receivable agreements. The payments under the tax receivable agreements are also not necessarily conditioned upon our Historical Owners maintaining a continued ownership interest in either RMCO or us.\nThe amounts that we may be required to pay to our Historical Owners under the tax receivable agreements may be accelerated in certain circumstances and may also significantly exceed the actual tax benefits that we ultimately realize.\nThe tax receivable agreements provide that if certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control were to occur, or that if, at any time, we elect an early termination of the tax receivable agreements, then our obligations, or our successor\u2019s obligations, to make payments under the tax receivable agreements would be based on certain assumptions, including an assumption that we would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize all potential future tax benefits that are subject to the tax receivable agreements.\nAs a result, (i) we could be required to make cash payments to our Historical Owners that are greater than the specified percentage of the actual benefits we ultimately realize in respect of the tax benefits that are subject to the tax receivable agreements, and (ii) if we elect to terminate the tax receivable agreements early, we would be required to make an immediate cash payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future tax benefits that are the subject of the tax receivable agreements, which payment may be made significantly in advance of the actual realization, if any, of such future tax benefits. In these situations, our obligations under the tax receivable agreements could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, other forms of business combination, or other changes of control. There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance our obligations under the tax receivable agreements.\nWe will also not be reimbursed for any cash payments previously made to our Historical Owners pursuant to the tax receivable agreements if any tax benefits initially claimed by us are subsequently challenged by a taxing authority and are ultimately disallowed. Instead, any excess cash payments made by us to either of our Historical Owners will be netted against any future cash payments that we might otherwise be required to make under the terms of the tax receivable agreements. However, we might not determine that we have effectively made an excess cash payment to either of our Historical Owners for a number of years following the initial time of such payment. As a result, it is possible that we could make cash payments under the tax receivable agreements that are substantially greater than our actual cash tax savings.\nIf we were deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d) as a result of our ownership of RMCO, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have an adverse effect on our business.\nUnder Sections 3(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the 1940 Act, a company generally will be deemed to be an \u201cinvestment company\u201d for purposes of the 1940 Act if (i) it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities or (ii) it engages, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We do not believe that we are an \u201cinvestment company,\u201d as such term is defined in either of those sections of the 1940 Act.\nAs the sole managing member of RMCO, we control and operate RMCO. On that basis, we believe that our interest in RMCO is not an \u201cinvestment security\u201d as that term is used in the 1940 Act. However, if we were to cease participation in the management of RMCO, our interest in RMCO could be deemed an \u201cinvestment security\u201d for purposes of the 1940 Act.\nWe and RMCO intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. However, if we were to be deemed an investment company, restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nRIHI directly (through ownership of our Class B common stock) and indirectly (through ownership of RMCO common units) owns interests in us, and RIHI has the right to redeem and cause us to redeem, as applicable, such interests pursuant to the terms of the New RMCO, LLC agreement. We may elect to issue shares of Class A common stock upon such redemption, and the issuance and sale of such shares may have a negative impact on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had an aggregate of 168,231,959 shares of Class A common stock authorized but unissued, including 17,734,600 shares of Class A common stock issuable upon redemption of RMCO common units that are held by RIHI. In connection with our IPO, RMCO entered into the New RMCO, LLC agreement, and subject to certain restrictions set forth therein, RIHI is entitled to potentially redeem the RMCO common units it holds for an aggregate of up to 17,734,600 shares of our Class A common stock, subject to customary adjustments. We also have entered into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which the shares of Class A common stock issued upon such redemption are eligible for resale, subject to certain limitations set forth therein.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Class A common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our Class A common stock may have on the market price of our Class A common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, including shares issued in connection with an acquisition, or the perception that such sales or distributions could occur, may cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with RIHI and our Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and Co-Founder.\nThe Class B common stock has no economic rights but entitles the holder, without regard to the number of shares of Class B common stock held, to a number of votes on matters presented to stockholders of RE/MAX Holdings that is equal to two times the aggregate number of common units of RMCO held by such holder. Our Class A common stock has one vote per share.\nBased on the voting rights associated with our Class B common stock, and the number of common units of RMCO that RIHI currently owns, RIHI holds approximately 75% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. As a result, RIHI controls a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore is able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future.\nRIHI is a Delaware corporation that is majority owned and controlled by David Liniger, our Chief Executive Officer, Chairman and Co-Founder, and Gail Liniger, our Vice Chair and Co-Founder. Vincent Tracey, our President and Daryl Jesperson, a director, hold minority ownership interests in RIHI.\nYou may be diluted by future issuances of additional Class A common stock in connection with our incentive plans, acquisitions or otherwise; future sales of such shares in the public market, or the expectations that such sales may occur, could lower our stock price.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue shares of Class A common stock and options, rights, warrants and appreciation rights relating to Class A common stock for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our board of directors in its sole discretion, whether in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. As of December 31, 2014, we had 1,707,419 reserved shares available for issuance under our 2013 Stock Incentive Plan. We granted options to purchase 787,500 shares of Class A common stock in substitution of options that were granted by RMCO. During 2014, 135,000 of these options were exercised. On May 20, 2014, 77,452 restricted stock units that were granted and vested in connection with the IPO were delivered for shares of Class A common stock to certain employees and directors. On December 1, 2014, 39,400 long-term incentive restricted stock units vested and were delivered for shares of Class A common stock to certain employees and directors. In connection with the retirement of Margaret Kelly, our former Chief Executive Officer, the vesting of previously unvested 30,304 long-term incentive restricted stock units was accelerated and such restricted stock units became fully vested on December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, 40,472 and zero restricted stock units and options were unvested, respectively. Any Class A common stock that we issue, including under our 2013 Stock Incentive Plan or other equity incentive plans that we may adopt in the future, would dilute the percentage ownership held by the investors who own Class A common stock.\nOur Class A common stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.\nMany factors, which are outside our control, may cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate significantly, including those described elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, as well as the following:\n\u00b7\nour operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u00b7\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry compared to market expectations;\n\u00b7\nconditions that impact demand for our services, including the condition of the U.S. residential housing market unrelated to our performance;\n\u00b7\nfuture announcements concerning our business or our competitors\u2019 businesses;\n\u00b7\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u00b7\nthe size of our public float;\n\u00b7\ncoverage by or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or failure to meet their expectations;\n\u00b7\nmarket and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;\n\u00b7\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u00b7\nchanges in government and environmental regulation;\n\u00b7\nhousing and mortgage finance markets;\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u00b7\nchanges in senior management or key personnel;\n\u00b7\nissuances, exchanges or sales, or expected issuances, exchanges or sales of our capital stock;\n\u00b7\nadverse resolution of new or pending litigation against us;\n\u00b7\nchanges in general market, economic and political conditions in the U.S. and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, acts of war and responses to such events; and\n\u00b7\nmaterial weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent investors from being able to sell their common stock at or above the price they paid for the stock. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low. As a result, you may suffer a loss on your investment.\nWe cannot assure you that we will have the available cash to make dividend payments.\nWe declared four cash dividends of $0.0625 per share of Class A common stock during 2014. On March 11, 2015, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share of Class A common stock and a special dividend of $1.50 per share of Class A common stock. We intend to continue to pay cash dividends quarterly. Whether we will do so, however, and the timing and amount of those dividends, will be subject to approval and declaration by our board of directors and will depend upon on a variety of factors, including our financial results, cash requirements and financial condition, our ability to pay dividends under our senior secured credit facility and any other applicable contracts, and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors. Any dividends declared and paid will not be cumulative.\nBecause we are a holding company with no material assets other than our ownership of common units of RMCO, we have no independent means of generating revenue or cash flow, and our ability to pay dividends is dependent upon the financial results and cash flows of RMCO and its subsidiaries and distributions we receive from RMCO. We expect to cause RMCO to make distributions to fund our expected dividend payments, subject to applicable law and any restrictions contained in RMCO\u2019s or its subsidiaries\u2019 current or future debt agreements.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law might discourage or delay acquisition attempts for us that you might consider favorable.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions:\n\u00b7\nestablish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time;\n\u00b7\nauthorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and the shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval, and which may include super voting, special approval, dividend or other rights or preferences superior to the rights of the holders of common stock;\n\u00b7\nprovide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws;\n\u00b7\ndelegate the sole power to a majority of the board of directors to fix the number of directors;\n\u00b7\nprovide the power of our board of directors to fill any vacancy on our board of directors, whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise;\n\u00b7\neliminate the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u00b7\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nOur certificate of incorporation also contains a provision that provides us with protections similar to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, and prevents us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least 15% of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock unless board or stockholder approval is obtained prior to the acquisition, except that David and Gail Liniger are deemed to have been approved by our board of directors, and thereby not subject to these restrictions. These anti-takeover provisions and other provisions under Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our Company, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors of your choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions you desire.\nOur business and stock price may suffer as a result of our lack of public company operating experience.\nPrior to the IPO, we were a privately-held company since we began operations in 1973. Our lack of public company operating experience may make it difficult to forecast and evaluate our future prospects. If we are unable to execute our business strategy, either as a result of our inability to effectively manage our business in a public company environment or for any other reason, our prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed and our stock price may decline.\nAs an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we cannot be certain whether taking advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d makes our common stock less attractive to investors.\nThe JOBS Act provides that, so long as a company qualifies as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d it will, among other things, be exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that its independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory \u201csay-on-pay\u201d votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation.\nWe take advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements regarding executive compensation. We have irrevocably elected not to take advantage of the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards available under Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act. We cannot predict whether investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions, or whether taking advantage of these exemptions would result in less active trading or more volatility in the price of our Class A common stock. Also, we intend to take advantage of some of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available to us as long as we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company.\u201d", "PERMNO": 14221, "SIC": 6531, "TIC": "RMAX"}
