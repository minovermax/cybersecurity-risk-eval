{"cik": "1365038", "company": "DEMAND MEDIA INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to the Separation of Rightside\nOur operational and financial profile changed in connection with the Separation and we are now a smaller, less diversified company.\nOn August 1, 2014, we completed the Separation of Rightside from Demand Media. The Separation was structured as a pro rata tax-free dividend involving the distribution of all of the outstanding shares of Rightside common stock to holders of Demand Media common stock as of the record date (the \u201cDistribution\u201d). Following the Separation, we are a smaller, less diversified company focused on our Content & Media and Marketplaces businesses. This narrower business focus may leave us more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. The diminished diversification of revenue, costs, and cash flows could also cause our results of operation, cash flows, working capital and financing requirements to be subject to increased volatility. In addition, we may be unable to achieve some or all of the strategic and financial benefits that we expected would result from the Separation of the Company and Rightside, or such benefits may be delayed, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFollowing the Separation, we and Rightside will continue to be dependent on each other for certain support services for each respective business and may have indemnification obligations to each other with respect to such arrangements.\nWe entered into various agreements with Rightside in connection with the Separation, including a transition services agreement (the \u201cTransition Services Agreement\u201d), a separation and distribution agreement, a tax matters agreement (the \u201cTax Matters\nAgreement\u201d), an intellectual property assignment and license agreement, and an employee matters agreement. These agreements govern our relationship with Rightside subsequent to the Separation. If we are required to indemnify Rightside for certain liabilities and related losses arising in connection with any of these agreements or if Rightside is required to indemnify us for certain liabilities and related losses arising in connection with any of these agreements and does not fulfill its obligations to us, we may be subject to substantial liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.\nAdditionally, although Rightside will be contractually obligated to provide us with certain services during the term of the Transition Services Agreement, we cannot assure you that these services will be performed as efficiently or proficiently as they were performed prior to the Separation. When Rightside ceases to provide services pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, our costs of procuring those services from third parties may increase. In addition, we may not be able to replace these services in a timely manner or enter into appropriate third-party agreements on terms and conditions comparable to those under the Transition Services Agreement. To the extent that we require additional support from Rightside not addressed in the Transition Services Agreement, we would need to negotiate the terms of receiving such support in future agreements.\nIf there is a determination that the Separation is taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, then we and our stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.\nWe received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d), together with an opinion of Latham & Watkins LLP, tax counsel to us (the \u201cTax Opinion\u201d), substantially to the effect that, among other things, the Separation qualifies as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d). The private letter ruling and Tax Opinion relied on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from us and Rightside regarding the past and future conduct of the companies\u2019 respective businesses and other matters. The private letter ruling did not address all the requirements for determining whether the Separation would qualify for tax-free treatment, and the Tax Opinion, which addressed all such requirements but relied on the private letter ruling as to matters covered by the ruling, is not binding on the IRS or the courts. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and the Tax Opinion, the IRS could determine on audit that the Separation should be treated as taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the Tax Opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of us or Rightside after the Separation.\nIf the Separation ultimately is determined to be taxable, we would be subject to tax as if we had sold the Rightside common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and our stockholders would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution equal to the fair market value of Rightside\u2019s common stock that was distributed to them. Under the Tax Matters Agreement, we may be required to indemnify Rightside against all or a portion of the taxes incurred by Rightside in the event the Separation were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment under the Code. If we are required to pay any tax liabilities in connection with the Separation pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement or pursuant to applicable tax law, the amounts may be significant.\nWe have agreed to various restrictions to preserve the non-recognition treatment of the Separation, which may reduce our strategic and operating flexibility.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment to us of the Separation, under the Tax Matters Agreement that we entered into with Rightside, we may not take any action that would jeopardize the favorable tax treatment of the Separation. The restrictions under the Tax Matters Agreement may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or engage in other transactions that might increase the value of our business for the two-year period following the Separation. For example, we might determine to continue to operate certain of our business operations for the foreseeable future even if a sale or discontinuance of such business might have otherwise been advantageous. Moreover, in light of the requirements of Section 355(e) of the Code, we might determine to forgo certain transactions, including share repurchases, stock issuances, certain asset dispositions or other strategic transactions for some period of time following the Separation. In addition, our indemnity obligation under the Tax Matters Agreement might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control transaction for some period of time following the Separation.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nIf Internet search engines continue to modify their methodologies, traffic to our owned and operated online properties and to our customers\u2019 online properties could decline significantly.\nWe depend on various Internet search engines, such as Google, Bing and Yahoo!, to direct a significant amount of traffic to our owned and operated online properties and our customers\u2019 online properties. For the year ended December 31, 2014, based on our internal data, a majority of the traffic directed to eHow.com and Livestrong.com came directly from these Internet search engines and more than half of the traffic from search engines came from Google. Changes in the methodologies or algorithms used by search engines to display results could cause our owned and operated online properties or our customers\u2019 online properties to receive less\nfavorable placements or be removed from the search results. Internet search engines could decide that content on our owned and operated online properties or our customers\u2019 online properties, or the size and placement of ad units displayed on webpages hosting our content, is unacceptable or violates their corporate policies. Internet search engines could also view changes made to our owned and operated online properties or our customers\u2019 online properties unfavorably, leading to lower search result rankings and a decrease in search referral traffic.\nGoogle, Bing and Yahoo! regularly deploy changes to their search engine algorithms. Since 2011, we have experienced fluctuations in the total number of Google search referrals to our owned and operated online properties, including eHow.com and Livestrong.com, and to our customers\u2019 online properties. During 2013, we experienced several negative changes in Google referrals to our owned and operated online properties that, in the aggregate, were larger in magnitude than those that we previously experienced, and we have and may continue to experience negative changes in Google referrals to our owned and operated online properties. Beginning in 2014, Bing and Yahoo! began to implement similar changes to their search engine algorithms. These changes have resulted, and may continue to result, in substantial declines in traffic directed to our owned and operated online properties. Any future or ongoing changes that impact search referral traffic to our owned and operated online properties or our customers\u2019 online properties may result in material fluctuations in our financial performance.\nThe recent changes to search engine algorithms by Google, Bing and Yahoo!, and any future changes that may be made by search engines that negatively impact the volume of referral traffic, could further negatively impact our business. Any reduction in the number of users directed to our owned and operated online properties or our customers\u2019 online properties would likely negatively affect our ability to earn revenue. If traffic to our owned and operated online properties or our customers\u2019 online properties declines, we may be unable to cost-effectively replace lost traffic, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon certain arrangements with Google for a significant portion of our revenue. A termination of, or a loss of revenue generated from, our agreements with Google would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have an extensive relationship with Google and a significant portion of our revenue is derived from advertising provided by Google. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, after giving effect to the Separation, we derived approximately 50%, 56% and 60%, respectively, of our total revenue from our arrangements with Google. Google provides cost-per-click advertisements and cost-per-impression advertisements to our owned and operated online properties and we receive a portion of the revenue generated by such advertisements. We also utilize Google\u2019s DoubleClick Ad Exchange, an auction marketplace that allows us to sell display advertising space on our owned and operated online properties and our customers\u2019 online properties. Our services agreement with Google, which governs our various advertising relationships with them, currently expires in October 2016. In addition, we use Google\u2019s DoubleClick ad serving technology to deliver advertisements to our and our customers\u2019 online properties. Google has the right to terminate these agreements prior to their expiration upon the occurrence of certain events, including if Google reasonably believes that our use of its services violates the rights of third parties, and other breaches of contractual provisions, a number of which are broadly defined. If our agreements with Google are terminated, or we are unable to enter into new agreements with Google on terms and conditions favorable to us prior to the expiration of the current agreements, we may not be able to enter into agreements with alternative third-party advertisement providers or for alternative ad serving platforms on acceptable terms or on a timely basis or both.\nFurthermore, our advertising agreement with Google may not continue to generate the same level of revenue that we have received from such arrangements during past periods for a variety of reasons, including a reduction in the amounts Google is able to charge advertisers and the possibility that our online properties do not generate sufficient traffic to realize our maximum revenue share percentage with Google. Our ability to generate online advertising revenue from Google also depends, in part, on Google\u2019s assessment of the quality and performance characteristics of Internet traffic resulting from online advertisements placed on our owned and operated online properties and on our customers\u2019 online properties. In addition, Google may at any time change the nature of, or suspend, the services that it provides to online advertisers and the catalog of advertisers from which online advertisements are sourced, or modify its policies with respect to how advertisements may be displayed on a webpage. These types of changes or suspensions would adversely impact our ability to generate revenue from our advertising agreement with Google. Any termination of or change in the services that Google provides to us, or a loss of revenue generated by our advertising agreement with Google, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe generate the majority of our revenue from advertising. A reduction in ad unit rates, online advertising spend, a loss of advertisers or lower advertising yields could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party advertising providers, such as Google, to provide advertisements to our owned and operated online properties and our customers\u2019 online properties. For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, after giving effect to the Separation, we generated 70%, 83% and 83%, respectively, of our revenue from advertising, and we expect to continue to derive the majority of our revenue from advertising. We have experienced declines in ad unit rates for both desktop and mobile during 2014,\nresulting in lower advertising revenue, and any further reductions in ad unit rates would negatively impact our financial results. We also believe that advertising spend on the Internet, as in traditional media, fluctuates significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. These factors include variations in expenditures by advertisers due to budgetary constraints; the cyclical and discretionary nature of advertising spending; general economic conditions, as well as economic conditions specific to the Internet and media industry; and the occurrence of extraordinary events, such as natural disasters, international or domestic terrorist attacks or armed conflict. Additionally, brands and advertisers are increasingly focusing a portion of their online advertising budgets on social media outlets such as Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest. If this trend continues and we are unable to offer competitive or similarly valued advertising opportunities, our revenue from advertising could be adversely impacted. An inability to maintain or increase our advertising revenue would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 2014, we shifted our advertising strategy with respect to our display ad inventory to focus on programmatic offerings that utilize advertising network exchanges rather than a direct sales force. This shift requires us to actively manage the sale of our owned and operated inventory on an advertising exchange. An inability to successfully manage this process could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, one component of our platform that we use to generate advertiser interest is our system of monetization tools, which is designed to match content with advertisements in a manner that optimizes revenue yield and end-user experience. Advertising providers and advertisers will stop placing advertisements on our owned and operated online properties or our customers\u2019 online properties if their investments do not generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, or if we do not deliver their advertisements in an appropriate and effective manner. The failure of our yield-optimized monetization technology to effectively match advertisements with our content in a manner that results in increased revenue for advertisers would have an adverse impact on our ability to maintain or increase our revenue from advertising. If any of our advertisers or advertising providers, and in particular Google, decides not to continue advertising on, or providing advertisements to, our owned and operated online properties or our customers\u2019 online properties, or modifies its advertising policies in a manner that could negatively impact yield, we could experience a rapid decline in our revenue over a relatively short period of time.\nChanges in our Content & Media business model and increased expenditures for certain aspects of this business, including planned improvements to certain of our online properties, will negatively impact our operating margins in the near-term and may not lead to increased visits and revenue in the long-term.\nWe have incurred and intend to continue to incur significant expenses to improve the user experience and engagement on certain of our owned and operated online properties by redesigning our websites; refining and consolidating our existing content library; reducing the number of advertisements per page; and developing a greater variety of content formats, particularly formats better suited for mobile devices. Such expenses do not directly generate related revenue and could lead to reduced revenue, and these changes will negatively impact our operating margins in the near-term. These changes also may not result in increased visits to, or increased revenue generated by, our owned and operated online properties in the long-term. In addition, we recorded approximately $7.2 million of accelerated amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2014 and are likely to record a significant amount of accelerated amortization expense during fiscal 2015 in connection with removing additional content from our library. As a result of previous evaluations of our content library, we elected to remove certain articles, videos and slideshows, resulting in related accelerated amortization expense of $2.4 million, $2.1 million and $5.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.\nIn addition, we plan to continue to expand our investment in our Content Solutions offering, which helps publishers and brands broaden their reach online by providing them with topically relevant custom content, spanning across text, video, photography and designed visuals, to publish on their online properties or for use in other distribution outlets. If our existing and prospective Content Solutions customers do not perceive our content to be driving performance for their business, we may not be able to expand our relationship with our current customers or identify and attract new customers, and we may not generate sufficient revenue through this service offering to justify our current investment in this business.\nIf we are unable to successfully implement our new online marketplace initiatives, or if the revenue generated from these initiatives is less than the costs of such initiatives, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe operate two leading artist marketplaces where large communities of artists can market and sell their original artwork and their designs on art prints and other products. Society6, which we acquired in June 2013, provides artists with an online commerce platform to feature and sell their original designs on art prints, phone and tablet cases, t-shirts and other consumer products. Saatchi Art, which we acquired in August 2014, is an online art gallery featuring a wide selection of paintings, drawings, sculpture and photography that provides a global community of artists a curated environment in which to exhibit and sell their work directly to consumers around the world. We have limited experience in implementing, marketing, managing and growing these revenue streams.\nThe success of our marketplace initiatives is dependent upon a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\ndemand for these products, market acceptance of our products and our ability to attract new customers;\n\u00b7\nincreased brand awareness and the reputation of our online marketplaces;\n\u00b7\nour ability to maintain the artist communities on Society6 and Saatchi Art so that artists continue to contribute and maintain their original artwork and designs on these marketplaces;\n\u00b7\nour ability to cost-effectively develop, introduce and market new products on a timely basis to address changing consumption trends, consumer preferences and new technologies;\n\u00b7\nthe success and competitiveness of new entrants into this highly competitive industry;\n\u00b7\ncompetitive pricing pressures, including potential discounts offered to attract customers and reduced or free shipping;\n\u00b7\nmaintaining significant strategic relationships with our print-on-demand suppliers and ensuring the quality of their products and the timeliness of our production cycle;\n\u00b7\ndisruptions in the supply-chain, production and fulfillment operations associated with the print-on-demand products sold through our online marketplaces;\n\u00b7\nshipping disruptions or delays with the products sold through our online marketplaces;\n\u00b7\nthe return rate for products sold through our online marketplaces;\n\u00b7\nthe overall growth rate of e-commerce and online marketplaces;\n\u00b7\noverall changes in consumer spending on discretionary purchases; and\n\u00b7\nlegal claims, including copyright and trademark infringement claims, associated with content that is included in the products sold through our online marketplaces, as well as product liability claims, both of which may expose us to greater litigation cost in the future as compared to historical levels.\nIf we are unable to successfully implement our new online marketplace initiatives, or if the revenue generated from these initiatives is less than the costs of such initiatives, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain visitors to our online properties or customers for our artist marketplaces, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIn order for our business to grow, we must attract new visitors to our online properties and new customers for our artist marketplaces, and we must retain our existing visitors and customers. Our success in attracting traffic to our owned and operated online properties and to our customers\u2019 online properties and converting these visitors into repeat users depends, in part, upon our continued ability to identify, create and distribute high-quality content and connect consumers with the formats and types of content that meets their specific interests and enables them to interact with supporting communities. We may not be able to identify and create the desired variety, quality and types of content in a cost-effective manner or meet rapidly changing consumer demand in a timely manner, if at all.\nAdditionally, while we use proprietary technology and algorithms designed to predict consumer demand and return on investment to create and distribute our content cost-effectively, the ultimate returns on our investment in content creation are difficult to predict and may not be sustained in future periods at the same level as in past periods. Furthermore, our proprietary technology and algorithms are dependent on analyzing existing Internet search traffic data, and our analysis may be impaired by changes in Internet traffic or search engines\u2019 methodologies, which we do not control. Another method we employ to attract and acquire new, and retain existing, visitors is search engine optimization (\u201cSEO\u201d), which involves developing content to rank well in search engine results. Our ability to successfully manage SEO efforts across our owned and operated online properties and our customers\u2019 online properties is dependent on our timely and effective modification of SEO practices implemented in response to periodic changes in search engine algorithms and methodologies and changes in search query trends. Historically, we have been unable to generate a significant amount of traffic to our online properties outside of our SEO efforts. If we do not successfully manage and modify our SEO efforts, we could experience substantial declines in traffic to the online properties that publish our content, which would result in lower conversion rates\nand less repeat business. Even if we succeed in driving traffic to our and our customers\u2019 online properties, we may not be able to effectively monetize this traffic or otherwise retain visitors, which could result in lower advertising revenue from our owned and operated online properties and decreases in the number of customers publishing our content to their online properties. Any failure to identify, create and distribute high-quality content or to effectively monetize traffic to our online properties would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn order to grow our online marketplaces, we must expand our customer base, which will require us to appeal to customers who have historically used other means of commerce to purchase similar products or who may already use our competitors\u2019 offerings. We may incur significant expenses related to customer acquisition and the net sales from new customers may not ultimately exceed the cost of acquiring these customers. Our ability to attract new customers to our marketplaces also depends, in part, on our ability to establish and maintain relationships with the various channels used by our current and prospective customers, including social media sites, search engines, and other online services, in order to drive traffic to our online properties. If we are unable to develop or maintain these relationships, our ability to attract new customers would suffer. Additionally, we believe that many of the new customers for our marketplaces originate from word-of-mouth and other non-paid referrals from existing customers. If we fail to deliver an enjoyable shopping experience or if our customers do not perceive the products sold through our marketplaces to be of high value and quality, we may experience difficulties retaining our existing customers and attracting new customers through referrals, which would require us to incur significantly higher marketing expenses to attract new customers. If the number of transactions generated by our current customer base declines, or we are unable to attract new customers to our marketplaces, we may experience lower customer growth than expected and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face significant competition, which we expect will continue to intensify, and we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position or market share.\nWe operate in highly competitive and still developing markets. The industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change, various business models and frequent disruption of incumbents by innovative entrants. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors and a failure to increase, or the loss of, market share, would likely seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nContent & Media\nWe face intense competition for our Content & Media service offering from a wide range of competitors. We compete for advertisers and customers on the basis of a number of factors including return on marketing expenditures, price of our offerings and the ability to deliver large amounts, or precise types, of segmented customer traffic. Our current principal competitors include:\n\u00b7\nOnline Marketing and Media Companies. We compete with other Internet marketing and media companies, such as AOL, IAC and various startup companies as well as leading online media companies such as Yahoo!, for online marketing budgets. Most of these competitors compete with us across several areas of consumer interest, such as do-it-yourself, health and healthy living, home and garden, arts and crafts, beauty and fashion, golf, outdoors and humor.\n\u00b7\nSocial Media Outlets. We compete with social media outlets such as Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest, where brands and advertisers are focusing a significant portion of their online advertising spend in order to connect with their customers.\n\u00b7\nSpecialized and Enthusiast Online Properties. We compete with companies that provide specialized consumer information online, particularly in the do-it-yourself, health and healthy living, home and garden, arts and crafts, beauty and fashion, golf, outdoors and humor categories, as well as enthusiast online properties in specific categories, including message boards, blogs and other enthusiast websites maintained by individuals and other Internet companies.\n\u00b7\nDistributed Content Creation Platforms. We compete with companies that employ a content creation model with aspects similar to our platform, such as NewsCred and Contently, including for the creation of content for third-parties.\nWe may be subject to increased competition in the future if any of these competitors devote increased resources to more directly address the online market for the professional creation of content. For example, if Google chose to compete more directly with us, we may face the prospect of the loss of business or other adverse financial consequences given that Google possesses a significantly greater consumer base, financial resources, distribution channels and patent portfolio. In addition, should Google decide to directly compete with us in areas such as content creation, it may decide for competitive reasons to terminate or not renew our commercial agreements and, in such an event, we may experience a rapid decline in our revenue from the loss of our source for advertising on our owned and operated online properties and on our customers\u2019 online properties. In addition, Google\u2019s access to more comprehensive data regarding user search queries through its search algorithms would give it a significant competitive advantage over everyone in the industry, including us. If this data is used competitively by Google, sold to online publishers or given away for free, our business may\nface increased competition from companies, including Google, with substantially greater resources, brand recognition and established market presence.\nIn addition to Google, many of our current and other potential competitors for our Content & Media service offering enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, substantially greater financial, technical and other resources and, in some cases, the ability to combine their online marketing products with traditional offline media such as newspapers or magazines. These companies may use these advantages to offer products and services similar to ours at a lower price, develop different products to compete with our current offerings and respond more quickly and effectively than we can to new or changing opportunities, technologies, standards or customer requirements. For example, both AOL and Yahoo! may have access to proprietary search data which could be utilized to assist them in their content creation processes. In addition, many of our current and potential competitors have established marketing relationships with and access to larger customer bases. Due to this intense competition, we may be unable to maintain or improve our competitive position or market share in the content and media business.\nMarketplaces\nOur Marketplaces service offering competes with a wide variety of online and brick-and-mortar companies selling original artwork and customized design-focused products. Society6 competes with companies, such as RedBubble, Zazzle and Minted, that offer specialty products that are produced and shipped based on a print-on-demand model, whereby user or artist generated art designs are printed on t-shirts, art prints, mobile accessories and other products, as well as small online providers of niche customization services and product offerings. Saatchi Art competes with traditional offline art galleries, art consultants and other online properties selling original artwork, such as Artfinder, Artspace and Ugallery. We expect competition to continue to intensify as online and offline businesses increasingly are competing with each other, and because the barriers to entry into online channels can be low. Businesses can launch online sites or mobile platforms and applications for a nominal cost by using commercially-available software or partnering with successful e-commerce companies.\nBoth of our artist marketplaces must successfully attract, retain and engage both buyers and sellers to use our platforms. We believe that the principal competitive factors for our marketplaces include the quality, price and uniqueness of the products being offered; the selection of goods and artists featured on our online properties; the ability to source numerous products efficiently and cost-effectively with respect to our print-on-demand products; customer service; the convenience and ease of the shopping experience we provide; and our reputation and brand strength.\nMany of our current competitors for our artist marketplaces have, and potential competitors may have, longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater technical capabilities, and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. Some of our competitors may offer or continue to offer faster and/or free shipping, favorable return policies or other transaction-related services which improve their user experience, but which could be impractical or inefficient for our sellers to match. Some of our competitors may be able to use the advantages of brick-and-mortar stores or other sorts of physical presence to build their customer bases and drive sales. These factors may allow our competitors to derive greater net sales and profits from their existing customer base, acquire customers at lower costs, use incentive programs to acquire our customers, or respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in consumer habits. These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies, which may allow them to build larger customer bases or generate net sales from their customer bases more effectively than we do. For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully against the current and potential competitors to our artist marketplaces.\nMobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, are increasingly being used to access the Internet and our online media offerings may not be as effective when accessed through these devices. Additionally, mobile advertising yields are lower on average than those for desktop and laptop computers, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nHistorically, most online media consumption has occurred on a desktop or laptop computer. However, the number of people who access the Internet through mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets has increased substantially in recent years. If we cannot effectively distribute our content, products and services on these devices, we could experience a decline in visits and traffic and a corresponding decline in revenue. It is also more difficult to display advertisements on mobile devices without disrupting the consumer experience. We may make changes to the layouts and formats of our mobile web optimized sites in order to improve the user experience or comply with the requirements of our advertising partners, which could negatively impact our monetization efforts on mobile devices. In addition, mobile advertising yields on average are currently lower than those for desktop and laptop computers, in part due to the limitations involved in using cookies on mobile devices to track and optimize mobile advertising and the reduced screen space available to render ads to consumers. The continued increase in mobile consumption of our content, which is now contributing significantly higher visit growth as compared to visit growth from desktop or laptop computers, has resulted in a reduction in our Content & Media revenue per one thousand visits, or RPVs. As a result of these factors, the increasing use of mobile devices to access our content could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the mobile solutions available to buyers and sellers using our online marketplaces are not effective, the growth prospects of our marketplace platforms could decline and our business could be adversely affected.\nConsumers are increasingly conducting online shopping on mobile devices and tablets instead of desktop computers. Although we are currently focused on improving the mobile experience for both buyers and sellers using our online marketplaces, the smaller screen size and reduced functionality associated with some mobile device interfaces may make the use of our marketplace platforms more difficult or less appealing to our members, and visits to our marketplaces on mobile devices may not convert into purchases as often as visits made through desktop computers. Society6 and Saatchi Art sellers are also increasingly using mobile devices to operate and monitor their businesses on our platforms and if we are not able to deliver a rewarding experience to sellers using mobile devices, our marketplace businesses may suffer. Additionally, developing and supporting apps for our online marketplaces may require substantial time and resources, particularly as new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, and we may encounter problems with our apps or mobile sites after development and launch. If our members encounter difficulty accessing or using our marketplace platforms on their mobile devices, or if our members choose not to use our marketplace platforms on their mobile devices, our growth prospects and our business may be adversely affected.\nIf we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to our customers, we may not remain competitive, and our revenue and operating results could suffer.\nOur success depends on our ability to innovate and provide products and services useful to or sought out by our customers. We must continue to invest significant resources in product development in order to maintain and enhance our existing products and services and introduce new products and services that deliver a sufficient return on investment and that our customers can easily and effectively use. If we are unable to provide quality products and services, we may lose visitors, advertisers and customers, and our revenue and operating results would suffer. Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our customers and our advertisers, are not appropriately timed with market opportunities or are not effectively brought to market.\nHistorically, the success of our Content & Media service offering has been closely tied to the success of eHow. If eHow\u2019s performance falters, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, after giving effect to the Separation, we generated approximately 43%, 56% and 57%, respectively, of our revenue from eHow. eHow depends primarily on various Internet search engines to direct traffic to the site and we have historically had difficulty driving increased amounts of traffic to eHow outside of our SEO efforts. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we estimate that approximately 81% of eHow\u2019s traffic came from search engines, with nearly all of eHow\u2019s search engine traffic coming from Google, Yahoo! and Bing. The success of eHow could be adversely impacted by a number of factors, including further changes in search engine algorithms or other methodologies similar to those previously implemented by Google, Bing and Yahoo! that negatively impact the volume of referral traffic, some of which negatively impacted search referral traffic to eHow and caused a reduction in visits to eHow; overall declines in cost-per-click rates seen throughout the industry; our failure to properly manage SEO efforts for eHow; our failure to prevent internal technical issues that disrupt traffic to eHow; or reduced reliance by Internet users on search engines to locate relevant content. Additionally, as we continue to evaluate and improve the user experience on eHow, we may make changes, such as refining the content library, reducing the number of advertising units and changing the format of advertising units, that are designed to improve the consumer experience on eHow, but which could negatively impact revenue. We have also already produced a significant amount of content that is housed on eHow and it has become difficult for us to continue to identify topics and produce content with the same level of broad consumer appeal as the content we have produced up to this point. A decline in eHow\u2019s performance could result in a material adverse effect to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPoor perception of our brands or business could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur Content & Media business is dependent on attracting a large number of visitors to our owned and operated online properties and our customers\u2019 online properties and providing leads and clicks to our advertisers, which depends in part on our reputation within the industry and with our users. Perception that the quality of our content may not be the same or better than that of other published Internet content, even if baseless, can damage our reputation. Any damage to our reputation could harm our ability to attract and retain advertisers, visitors, customers, freelance professionals and artists, which would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, certain of our owned and operated online properties, such as Livestrong.com and eHow.com, as well as some of the content we produce for our customers\u2019 online properties, are associated with high-profile experts to enhance brand recognition and credibility. Any adverse news reports, negative publicity or other alienation of all or a segment of our consumer base relating to these high-profile experts would reflect poorly on our brands and could have a material adverse effect on our business. For example, Livestrong.com is a licensed trademark from the Livestrong Foundation, which is the charitable foundation created by Lance Armstrong to promote cancer awareness and healthy lifestyles.\nWe rely primarily on freelance professionals and artists for a majority of our online content. We may not be able to attract or retain sufficient freelance professionals and artists to generate content on a scale or of a quality sufficient to grow or maintain our business.\nWe rely primarily on freelance professionals for the content that we distribute through our owned and operated online properties and our customers\u2019 online properties, and on artists to sell their original artwork on Saatchi Art or upload their unique art designs to Society6. We may not be able to attract or retain sufficient qualified and experienced freelance professionals and artists to generate content on a scale or of a quality sufficient to grow or maintain our business. For example, our content solutions offering may require the engagement of producers, contributors, talent, editors and filmmakers with a specialized skill set, and there is no assurance that we will be able to engage such specialists in a cost-effective manner or at all. In addition, our online artist marketplaces rely on artists to join our communities and contribute original artwork and designs that they seek to sell or monetize through the sale of art prints and other print-on-demand products.\nFurthermore, as our business evolves, we may not offer the volume of traditional content assignments that we previously offered, and some of our freelance professionals may seek assignments elsewhere or otherwise stop producing content for us. In addition, our competitors may attempt to attract members of our freelance professional and artist communities by offering compensation and revenue-sharing arrangements that we are unable to match. In the vast majority of cases we have no written agreements with freelance professionals which obligate them to create content beyond the specific content that they elect to create at any particular time, and no agreements with artists to obligate them to continue to contribute or maintain original designs and artwork on Society6 or Saatchi Art. In the event that we are unable to attract or retain qualified freelance professionals, we could incur substantial costs in procuring suitable replacement content, and if we are unable to attract artists to our online marketplaces, our revenues from sales of artwork and print-on-demand products will decrease, either of which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in developing new content offerings, including our content solutions services, or acquiring, investing in or developing new lines of business, which may limit our future growth and have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nImportant potential areas of growth for us are the development of new content offerings, including our content solutions services, and the acquisition, investment or internal development of new lines of business such as our marketplace initiatives. We have limited experience developing our content solutions services and developing, launching or growing online marketplaces, and we may not be successful in implementing these new lines of business. New lines of business may also be subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies frequently encountered by new businesses in competitive environments, many of which are beyond our control, including the lack of market acceptance. If we develop, acquire or invest in new lines of business or new content offerings, we will need to effectively integrate and manage these new businesses and implement appropriate operational, financial and management systems and controls. We may not be able to achieve the expected benefits from these new lines of business or content offerings, and we may not recover the funds and resources we have expended on them. If we are unable to successfully acquire, invest in or develop new lines of business or expand our content offerings, our future growth would be limited which could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of third-party data providers, or the inability to use data in the way we currently do, could significantly diminish the value of our algorithms, which could limit the effectiveness of our content creation process and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nWe collect data regarding consumer search queries from a variety of sources. When a user accesses one of our owned and operated online properties, we may have access to certain data associated with the source and specific nature of the visit. We also license consumer search query data from third parties. We have created algorithms that utilize this data to help us determine what content consumers are seeking, if that content is valuable to advertisers and whether we can cost-effectively produce this content. Some of these third-party consumer search data agreements are for perpetual licenses of a discrete amount of data and do not provide for updates of the data licensed. We may not be able to enter into agreements with these third parties to license additional data on the same or similar terms, if at all. If we are not able to enter into agreements with these providers, we may not be able to enter into agreements with alternative third-party consumer search data providers on acceptable terms or on a timely basis or both. Any termination of our relationships with these consumer search data providers, or any entry into new agreements on terms and conditions less favorable to us, could limit the effectiveness of our content creation process, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, new laws or changes to existing laws in this area may prevent or restrict our use of this data. In such event, the value of our algorithms and our ability to determine what consumers are seeking could be significantly diminished.\nWe depend upon the quality of traffic to our owned and operated online properties and our customers\u2019 online properties to provide value to online advertisers, and any failure in our quality control could have a material adverse effect on the value of such online properties to our third-party advertisement distribution providers and online advertisers and thereby adversely affect our revenue.\nWe depend upon the quality of traffic to our owned and operated online properties and our customers\u2019 online properties to provide value to online advertisers. Low quality traffic can include clicks associated with non-human processes, including robots, spiders or other software; the mechanical automation of clicking; and other types of invalid clicks or click fraud. There is a risk that a certain amount of low-quality traffic, or traffic that is deemed to be invalid by online advertisers, will be delivered to online advertisers on our online properties or our customers\u2019 online properties. As a result, we may be required to credit future amounts owed to us by our advertising partners or repay them for amounts previously received if such future amounts are insufficient. Furthermore, low-quality or invalid traffic may be detrimental to our relationships with third-party advertisement distribution providers and online advertisers, and could adversely affect our revenue.\nAs a creator and a distributor of Internet content, we face potential liability and expenses for legal claims based on the nature and content of the materials that we create or distribute, or that are accessible via our owned and operated online properties and our customers\u2019 online properties. If we are required to pay damages or expenses in connection with these legal claims, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed.\nAs a creator and distributor of original content and third-party provided content, we face potential liability in the United States and abroad based on a variety of theories, including copyright or trademark infringement, defamation, negligence, unlawful practice of a licensed profession and other legal theories based on the nature, creation or distribution of this information, and under various laws, including the Lanham Act and the Copyright Act. We may also be exposed to similar liability in connection with content that we do not create but that is posted to our owned and operated online properties and to our customers\u2019 online properties by users and other third parties through forums, comments, personas and other social media features. In addition, it is also possible that visitors to our owned and operated online properties or our customers\u2019 online properties could bring claims against us for losses incurred in reliance upon information provided on such online properties. These claims, regardless of their merit, could divert management time and attention away from our business and result in significant costs to investigate and defend. If we become subject to these or similar types of claims and are not successful in our defense, we may be forced to pay substantial damages. If the content we distribute through our owned and operated online properties or our customers\u2019 online properties violates the intellectual property rights of others or gives rise to other legal claims against us, we could be subject to substantial liability, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to our Company\nWe have a history of operating losses and may not be able to operate profitably or sustain positive cash flow in future periods.\nWe were founded in 2006 and, except for the year ended December 31, 2012, when we generated net income, we have had a net loss in every year from inception, including generating a net loss of $267.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014 we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $352.1 million and we may incur net operating losses in the future. Moreover, our cash flows from operating activities in the future may not be sufficient to fund our desired level of investment and expenditures in our content creation and distribution platform and online marketplaces, as well as the development and launch of new products and services. Our ability to generate net income in the future will depend in large part on our ability to generate and sustain substantially increased revenue levels, while continuing to control our expenses. We may incur significant operating losses in the future for a number of reasons, including those discussed in other risk factors and factors that we cannot foresee, and we may be unable to generate net income or sufficient positive cash flows.\nWe may not be able to obtain capital when desired on favorable terms, if at all, or without substantial dilution to our stockholders, which may impact our ability to execute on our current or future business strategies.\nWe anticipate that our current cash, cash equivalents and cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next 12 months. It is possible, however, that we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise have the capital resources to meet our future capital needs, including to invest in areas for growth, and we do not currently have a line of credit in place if we need to borrow funds. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise have sufficient capital resources available, we may need to enter into a new financing arrangement to execute on our current or future business strategies, including developing new or investing in existing service offerings, maintaining our operating infrastructure, acquiring complementary businesses, hiring additional personnel or otherwise responding to competitive pressures. We cannot assure you that a new financing arrangement will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all. Furthermore, if we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt or equity securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, if and when needed, our ability to fund our operations, meet obligations in the normal course of business, take advantage of strategic opportunities, or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited.\nThe intangible assets on our balance sheet may be subject to impairment. If our intangible assets or goodwill become impaired we may be required to record a significant non-cash charge to earnings which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe carry a substantial amount of intangible assets on our balance sheet, primarily from the creation of our long-lived media content. We also carry goodwill on our balance sheet from certain acquisitions we have made over the past several years. We assess potential impairments to our intangible assets and goodwill when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such intangible assets or goodwill may not be recoverable. In the third quarter of 2014, we experienced unexpected revenue declines attributable to lower traffic and monetization yield on certain of our Content & Media websites that caused us to lower our future cash flow expectations. Additionally, our market capitalization remained at a level below the book value of our net assets for an extended period of time, including as of September 30, 2014. As a result of these factors, we performed an interim assessment of impairment of the goodwill in our Content & Media reporting unit in the third quarter of 2014. In performing the impairment assessment, we determined that the implied fair value of goodwill in the reporting unit was substantially lower than its carrying value and recorded a $232.3 million pretax impairment charge in the third quarter of 2014. We performed our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2014, and based on the results of the annual impairment test there were no additional goodwill impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2014. Additional significant and sustained declines in our stock price and market capitalization relative to our book value or our inability to generate sufficient revenue or cash flows from our long-lived media content or the businesses that we have acquired may result in us having to take additional impairment charges against certain of our intangible assets or goodwill. If we are required to record additional impairment charges in future periods, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly in the period such charge is taken.\nOur operating results may fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis due to a number of factors, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur revenue and operating results could fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Our revenue and operating results in the near term will also fluctuate as a result of the Separation, including in connection with the public company costs to be borne by a smaller public company and the impact of cost allocations between the two companies. Therefore, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors discussed in this section, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\n\u00b7\nlower than anticipated levels of traffic to our owned and operated online properties and to our customers\u2019 online properties;\n\u00b7\nseasonality of the revenue associated with our online marketplaces, including increased sales activity during the holiday season;\n\u00b7\nspikes in sales of our print-on-demand products due to major social or political events resulting in a short-term demand for products with related content;\n\u00b7\ncompetitive pricing pressures, including shipping costs and potential discounts offered, associated with the products sold through our online marketplaces;\n\u00b7\ndisruptions in the supply-chain, production and fulfillment operations associated with the products sold through our online marketplaces;\n\u00b7\nthe amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the maintenance and expansion of our services, operations and infrastructure, especially one-time costs related to the development or acquisition of new products and services;\n\u00b7\nfailure of our content to generate sufficient or expected revenue during its estimated useful life to recover its unamortized creation costs, which may result in increased amortization expenses associated with, among other things, a decrease in the estimated useful life of our content, an impairment charge associated with our existing content, or expensing future content acquisition costs as incurred;\n\u00b7\ncreation of content in the future that may have a shorter estimated useful life as compared to our current portfolio of content, or which we license exclusively to third parties for periods that are less than the estimated useful life of our existing content, which may result in, among other things, increased content amortization expenses or the expensing of future content acquisition costs as incurred;\n\u00b7\nchanges in Internet advertising purchasing patterns by advertisers, and changes in how we sell advertisements from direct advertising sales to more automated advertising solutions;\n\u00b7\ntiming of and revenue recognition for certain transactions;\n\u00b7\nchanges in generally accepted accounting principles;\n\u00b7\nour focus on long-term goals over short-term results; and\n\u00b7\nweakness or uncertainty in general economic or industry conditions.\nIt is possible that our operating results may fluctuate and our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in one or more future quarters due to any of the factors listed above, a combination of those factors or other reasons, which could have a material adverse impact on the price of shares of our common stock.\nWe have made and may make additional acquisitions that involve significant execution, integration and operational risks and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions.\nWe evaluate acquisition and expansion opportunities on an ongoing basis and may pursue select acquisitions, such as our acquisitions of Society6 in June 2013 and Saatchi Art in August 2014. We may continue to make acquisitions of complementary websites, businesses, solutions, technologies or talent in the future to increase the scope of our business. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly. Potential acquisitions require significant attention from our management and could result in a diversion of resources from our existing business, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, the expected benefits of acquisitions may not materialize as planned, including achieving certain financial and revenue objectives. Certain acquired businesses or the transactions entered into as part of business combinations may also carry contingent liabilities that could materially impact our future results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. If we are unable to identify suitable future acquisition opportunities, reach agreement with such parties or obtain the financing necessary to make such acquisitions, we could lose market share to competitors who are able to make such acquisitions. This loss of market share could negatively impact our business, revenue and future growth.\nEven if we successfully complete an acquisition, we may not be able to successfully assimilate and integrate the acquired websites, business, assets, technologies, solutions, personnel or operations, particularly if key personnel of an acquired company decide not to work for us, and we therefore may not achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisition. Acquisitions also could harm our reputation or brands generally, as well as our relationships with existing customers. In addition, financing an acquisition may require us to (i) use substantial portions of our available cash on hand, (ii) incur additional indebtedness, which would increase our costs and impose operational limitations, and/or (iii) issue equity securities, which would dilute our stockholders\u2019 ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock. We may also unknowingly inherit liabilities from previous or future acquisitions that arise after the acquisition and are not adequately covered by indemnities, and certain stockholders of an acquired company may dissent from or object to an acquisition or otherwise seek to assert claims related to the transaction. For example, certain former common stockholders of Saatchi Art have filed a complaint alleging that (i) the former directors of Saatchi Art, certain former officers of Saatchi Art and certain preferred stockholders of Saatchi Art breached their fiduciary duties to the common stockholders in connection with the sale of Saatchi Art to us, (ii) certain preferred stockholders of Saatchi Art aided and abetted the former directors\u2019\nand officers\u2019 breach of fiduciary duties, and (iii) certain preferred stockholders and the Saatchi Art entity violated a Saatchi Art voting agreement by breaching the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. We may be required to expend significant resources in connection with this matter and, if any amounts are awarded to the claimants, we may not be able to recover all such amounts from the escrowed portion of the purchase price set aside to cover post-closing indemnification claims.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain our current personnel or hire additional personnel, our ability to develop and successfully market our business could be harmed.\nWe believe that our future success is highly dependent on the contributions of our executive officers, as well as our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, including engineers and developers. Since August 2012, several of our executive officers have resigned, including our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in October 2013 and our Chief Financial Officer in December 2014. We appointed Sean Moriarty as our new Chief Executive Officer in August 2014 and Rachel Glaser is expected to begin serving as our new Chief Financial Officer in April 2015. It is important that we retain other key personnel following these changes. In addition, qualified individuals that are critical to the success of our current and future business, including engineers and developers, are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. All of our officers and other employees are at-will employees, which means they can terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. Volatility or under-performance in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract new employees and retain our existing key employees. Our executive officers and employees may be more inclined to leave us if the perceived value of equity awards, including restricted stock units and stock options, decline. If we lose the services of key personnel, especially during this period of leadership transition, or do not hire or retain other personnel for key positions, our business and results of operation could be adversely affected. In addition, we do not maintain \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies for any of our executive officers.\nOur business is subject to online security risks, including security breaches, and any actual or perceived security breach could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of our systems, products and services involve the storage and transmission of information regarding our users, customers, and advertising and publishing partners, and our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks, malware or security incidents that result in third parties gaining access to such proprietary information. An increasing number of websites have recently disclosed online security breaches, some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on portions of their websites or infrastructure. Our security measures may be breached and unauthorized parties may attempt to gain access to our systems and information through various means, including hacking into our systems or facilities, fraud, employee error, malfeasance, or inserting malicious code or malware into our code base. For example, in 2014 we determined that an unauthorized individual may have gained access to the user names, email addresses and passwords of certain of our eHowNow customers. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users, or customers to disclose sensitive information by using fraudulent \u201cspoof\u201d and \u201cphishing\u201d emails and they may introduce viruses or other malware through \u201ctrojan horse\u201d programs to our users\u2019 computers in order to gain access to our systems and the data stored therein. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may be difficult to detect for a long time, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any security breach or unauthorized access could result in a misappropriation of our proprietary information or the proprietary information of our users, customers or partners, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure, an interruption in our operations and damage to our reputation. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users, customers, advertisers or publishers, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any security breach at a company providing services to us or our users could have similar effects. In addition, we may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by a breach, and the coverage limits on our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for any losses caused by security breaches.\nWe are subject to risks related to the third party credit card payment processing solution integrated with our websites. If our third party payment processors fail to be in compliance with applicable credit card rules and regulations, we may be required to migrate to an alternate payment processor, experience transaction downtime during the migration and lose customers.\nMany of our online marketplace customers pay amounts owed to us using a credit card or debit card. For credit and debit card payments, we pay payment processing fees in addition to interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating expenses and adversely affect our net income. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. We believe we and our payment processing service providers are compliant in all material respects with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which incorporates Visa\u2019s Cardholder Information Security Program and MasterCard\u2019s Site Data Protection standard. However, there is no guarantee that such compliance will be maintained or that compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our systems that are integrated with our payment processing providers. If either of our third party payment processors fails to be in compliance with applicable credit card rules and regulations, we may be required to migrate to an alternate\npayment processor which could result in transaction downtime during the migration and a loss of customers, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we do not adequately protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position and business may suffer.\nOur intellectual property, consisting of trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, patents and copyrights, is, in the aggregate, important to our business. We rely on a combination of trade secret, trademark, copyright and patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions together with contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights. We rely more heavily on trade secret protection than patent protection. To protect our trade secrets, we control access to our proprietary systems and technology, including our platforms, and we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants, as well as confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with other third parties. We face risks related to our intellectual property including that:\n\u00b7\nour intellectual property rights will not provide competitive advantages to us;\n\u00b7\nbecause of the relatively high cost we would experience in registering all of our copyrights with the United States Copyright Office, we generally do not register the copyrights associated with our content;\n\u00b7\nour ability to assert our intellectual property rights against potential competitors or to settle current or future disputes may be limited by our agreements with third parties;\n\u00b7\nour intellectual property rights may not be enforced in jurisdictions where competition is intense or where legal protection is weak;\n\u00b7\nany of the patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights that we presently employ in our business could lapse or be invalidated, circumvented, challenged or abandoned;\n\u00b7\ncompetitors will design around our protected systems and technology; or\n\u00b7\nwe may lose the ability to assert our intellectual property rights against others.\nEffective protection of our trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, copyrights and patents may not be available in all countries where we currently operate or in which we may operate in the future. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights can be difficult and costly. In addition, it may be necessary to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights through litigation or to defend litigation brought against us, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention and could adversely affect our business, even if we are successful on the merits.\nSome of our software and systems contain open source software, which may pose risks to our proprietary software and solutions.\nWe use open source software in our software and systems and will use open source software in the future. The licenses applicable to open source software typically require that the source code subject to the license be made available to the public and that any modifications or derivative works to open source software continue to be licensed under open source licenses. From time to time, we may face claims from third parties demanding the release or license of the open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software (which could include our proprietary source code), claiming infringement of their intellectual property rights, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to purchase a costly license, publicly release the affected portions of our source code, be limited in the licensing of our technologies or cease offering the implicated solutions unless and until we can re-engineer them to avoid infringement or change the use of the implicated open source software. In addition to risks related to license requirements, use of certain open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties, indemnities or other contractual protections with respect to the software (for example, non-infringement or functionality). Our use of open source software may also present additional security risks because the source code for open source software is publicly available, which may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to breach our sites and systems that rely on open source software. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage, and, if not addressed, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nThe interruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems, or those of third parties that we rely upon, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Any damage to or failure of our systems, or those of third parties that we rely upon (e.g., co-location providers for data servers, storage devices, and network access) could result in interruptions in our service, which could reduce our revenue and profits, and damage our brand. We have previously experienced certain server outages and computer distributed denial of service attacks, and any future server outages at our data center facilities or distributed denial of service attacks may cause all or portions of our online properties to become unavailable or impact service to our content creation studio. Our systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses or other attempts to harm our systems, and one of our data centers is located in an area with a high risk of major earthquakes. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage and intentional acts of vandalism, and to potential disruptions if the operators of these facilities have financial difficulties. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is currently underdeveloped and does not account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision to close a facility we are using without adequate notice for financial reasons or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. Delays or interruptions in our service may cause our users, advertisers, customers, artists and freelance professionals to become dissatisfied with our offerings and could adversely affect our business.\nFurthermore, third-party service providers may experience an interruption in operations or cease operations for any reason. If we are unable to agree on satisfactory terms for continued data center hosting relationships, we would be forced to enter into a relationship with other service providers or assume hosting responsibilities ourselves. If we are forced to switch hosting facilities, we may not be successful in finding an alternative service provider on acceptable terms or in hosting the computer servers ourselves. We may also be limited in our remedies against these providers in the event of a failure of service. We also rely on third-parties to provide certain components of our technology platform, such as hardware and software providers, and to serve as operators for our content delivery networks, or CDNs. A failure or limitation of service or available capacity by any of these third-party providers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on technology infrastructure and a failure to update or maintain this technology infrastructure, or difficulty scaling and adapting our existing technology and network infrastructure to accommodate increased traffic, could adversely affect our business.\nSignificant portions of our content, products and services are dependent on technology infrastructure that was developed over multiple years. To be successful, our network infrastructure has to perform well and be reliable. The greater the user traffic and the greater the complexity of our products and services, the more computing power we will need. In the future, we may spend substantial amounts to purchase or lease data centers and equipment, upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased traffic on our owned and operated online properties and roll out new products and services. Updating and replacing our technology infrastructure could be challenging to implement and manage, take time to test and deploy, cause us to incur substantial costs, cause us to suffer data loss, delays or interruptions in service or result in inefficiencies or operational failures. If we do not successfully update our technology and network infrastructure as needed, or if we experience inefficiencies and operational failures during such updates, the quality of our products and services and our users\u2019 experience could decline. This could damage our reputation and lead us to lose current and potential users, advertisers, customers, artists and freelance professionals. Failure to update our technology infrastructure as new technologies become available may also put us in a weaker position relative to a number of our key competitors. Competitors with newer technology infrastructure may have greater flexibility and be in a position to respond more quickly than us to new opportunities, which may impact our competitive position in certain markets and adversely affect our business. The costs associated with any adjustments to our technology and network infrastructure could also harm our operating results. Cost increases, loss of traffic or failure to accommodate new technologies could harm our business, revenue and financial condition.\nChanges in regulations or user concerns regarding privacy and protection of user data could diminish the value of our services and cause us to lose customers and revenue.\nWhen a user visits one of our websites or certain pages of our customers\u2019 websites, we use technologies, including \u201ccookies,\u201d to collect information related to the user, such as the user\u2019s Internet Protocol, or IP, address, demographic information, and history of the user\u2019s interactions with content or advertisements previously delivered by us. The information that we collect about our users helps us deliver appropriate content and targeted advertising to these users. A variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data that we receive from and about our users. In addition, various federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current or enact new laws regarding privacy matters. Recent developments related to \u201cinstant personalization\u201d and similar technologies potentially provide publishers with broader access to, and more detailed information about, users. These developments have led to greater scrutiny of industry data collection practices by regulators and privacy advocates. New laws may be enacted, new industry self-regulation may be promulgated, or existing laws may be amended or re-interpreted, in a manner that limits our ability to analyze user data. If our access to user data is limited through\nlegislation or any industry development, we may be unable to provide effective technologies and services to customers and we may lose customers and revenue.\nCertain U.S. and foreign laws and regulations could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad that may subject us to claims or other remedies. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may subject us to additional liabilities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Laws and regulations that are particularly relevant to our business address:\n\u00b7\nfreedom of expression;\n\u00b7\ninformation security and privacy;\n\u00b7\npricing and fees;\n\u00b7\ncontent and the distribution of content, including liability for user reliance on such content;\n\u00b7\nintellectual property rights, including secondary liability for infringement by others;\n\u00b7\ntaxation, including VAT; and\n\u00b7\nonline advertising and marketing, including email marketing and unsolicited commercial email.\nIn the United States, Congress has adopted legislation that regulates certain aspects of the Internet, including the Communications Decency Act, the Digital Millenium Copyright Act, the Lanham Act and the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act. Advertising and promotional information presented to visitors on our owned and operated online properties and our other marketing activities are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws that regulate unfair and deceptive practices. Many applicable laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet. Moreover, the applicability and scope of the laws that do address the Internet remain uncertain. For example, the laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are evolving. Claims have been either threatened or filed against us under both U.S. and foreign laws for defamation, copyright infringement, patent infringement, privacy violations, cybersquatting and trademark infringement. In the future, claims may also be brought against us based on tort law liability and other theories based on our content, products and services or content generated by our users.\nWe receive, process and store large amounts of personal data from users of our owned and operated online properties and from our freelance professionals and artists. We post privacy policies on all of our owned and operated websites that set forth our policies and practices related to the collection, use, sharing, disclosure and protection of personal data. The storing, sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personal information and user data are subject to federal, state and international privacy laws, the purpose of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. The existing privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. If requirements regarding the manner in which certain personal information and other user data are processed and stored change significantly, our business may be adversely affected, impacting our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the level of privacy required for consumer and other user data we collect. We may also need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches, including encrypting personal information, or remedy breaches after they occur, including notifying each person whose personal data may have been compromised. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us or various third-party vendors and service providers to comply with applicable privacy policies or with industry standards or laws or regulations could result in a loss of consumer confidence in us, or result in actions against us by governmental entities or others, all of which could potentially cause us to lose consumers and revenue.\nWe must also comply with certain foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations. Our business operations in countries outside the United States are subject to a number of U.S. federal laws and regulations, including restrictions imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and economic and trade sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (\u201cOFAC\u201d) and the U.S. Commerce Department based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted foreign states, organizations and individuals. The FCPA is intended to prohibit bribery of foreign officials or parties and requires public companies in the United States to keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect those companies\u2019 transactions. OFAC regulations prohibit U.S.-based entities from entering into or facilitating transactions with, for the benefit of, or involving the property of, persons, governments or countries designated by the U.S. government under one or more sanctions regimes, which could include transactions that provide a benefit that is received in an OFAC designated country. Additionally, some of the products and services we provide to customers globally may require approval under applicable U.S. export law.\nVAT, sales and use, and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. We do not collect such taxes in every jurisdiction in which we have sales based on our belief that such taxes are not applicable. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect VAT, sales and use, or similar taxes on our sales may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest for prior periods, and a requirement to collect such taxes in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest, or future requirements may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be exposed to claims for damages, financial penalties, reputational harm, incarceration of our employees or restrictions on our operations, which could increase our costs of operations, reduce our profits or cause us to forgo opportunities that would otherwise support our growth.\nChanges in state, federal or international taxation laws and regulations may adversely affect our business.\nDue to the global nature of the Internet, it is possible that, although our services and the Internet transmissions related to them typically originate in Nevada and California, governments of other states or foreign countries might attempt to regulate our transmissions or levy sales, income or other taxes relating to our activities. Tax authorities at the international, federal, state and local levels are also currently reviewing the appropriate treatment of companies engaged in Internet commerce. New or revised international, federal, state or local tax regulations may subject us or our customers to additional sales, income, VAT and other taxes. We cannot predict the effect of current attempts to impose sales, income, VAT or other taxes on commerce over the Internet. New or revised taxes and, in particular, additional sales taxes or VAT, would likely increase the cost of doing business online and decrease the attractiveness of advertising and selling goods and services over the Internet. New taxes could also create significant increases in internal costs necessary to capture data and collect and remit taxes. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThird parties may sue us for intellectual property infringement or misappropriation or make similar claims which, if successful, could require us to pay significant damages, incur expenses or curtail our offerings.\nWe cannot be certain that our internally developed or acquired systems and technologies do not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. In addition, we license content, software and other intellectual property rights from third parties and may be subject to claims of infringement or misappropriation if such parties do not possess the necessary intellectual property rights to the products or services they license to us. We have in the past and may in the future be subject to legal proceedings and claims that we have infringed the patent or other intellectual property rights of a third party. These claims sometimes involve patent holding companies or other patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may provide little or no deterrence. In addition, third parties may in the future assert intellectual property infringement claims against our customers, which we have agreed in certain circumstances to indemnify and defend against such claims. Any intellectual property-related infringement or misappropriation claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in costly litigation and could divert management resources and attention. If we are found liable for infringement or misappropriation, we may be required to enter into licensing agreements, if available on acceptable terms or at all, pay substantial damages or limit or curtail our systems and technologies. Also, any successful lawsuit against us could subject us to the invalidation of our proprietary rights. Moreover, we may need to redesign some of our systems and technologies to avoid future infringement liability. Any of the foregoing could prevent us from competing effectively and increase our costs.\nAdditionally, our Society6 and Saatchi Art digital artist marketplaces allow artists to sell original designs on various types of consumer products. On occasion, the designs posted to Society6 or Saatchi Art may infringe certain copyrights or trademarks or misappropriate the right of publicity of well-known figures. As a result, we may be the subject of letters, lawsuits and takedown notices from rights holders, and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act may not provide safe-harbors for all types of infringing content hosted on these properties. Addressing these types of claims could require us to expend time and resources, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, we license the names \u201cSaatchi\u201d and \u201cLivestrong.com\u201d pursuant to the terms of intellectual property or licensing agreements with third parties, which may be terminated by such third parties if we do not comply with certain requirements in the agreements. Charles Saatchi has alleged that we are in breach of our intellectual property agreement with him with respect to our use of the \u201cSaatchi\u201d name, although we believe that his claim is without merit. If either of the agreements relating to the licenses for the \u201cSaatchi\u201d or \u201cLivestrong.com\u201d names were terminated, we would experience business disruption and would have to incur significant resources to rebrand the relevant business, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not succeed in expanding our businesses internationally, which may limit our future growth, and operating internationally exposes us to certain additional risks and operating costs.\nOne potential area of growth for our business is in the international markets. We have launched eHow sites in the United Kingdom and Germany, as well as eHow en Espa\u00f1ol, Livestrong.com en Espa\u00f1ol and eHow Brasil (Spanish and Portuguese language\nsites that target both the U.S. and the worldwide Spanish/Portuguese-speaking markets). In addition, the artwork sold through Saatchi Art is created by a global community of artists and sold to customers around the world. We are also exploring launching our content and media properties in certain additional countries, as well as translating our Society6 site into certain foreign languages. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in introducing or marketing our products and services internationally or that our products and services will gain market acceptance. If we are unable to expand and market our products and services internationally, it could have a negative effect on our future growth prospects. There are also risks inherent in conducting business in international markets, including the need to localize our products and services to foreign customers\u2019 preferences and customs, difficulties in managing operations due to language barriers, distance, staffing and cultural differences, application of foreign laws and regulations to us, tariffs and other trade barriers, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, establishing management systems and infrastructures, reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries, changes in foreign political and economic conditions, and potentially adverse tax consequences. Operating internationally, where we have limited experience, exposes us to additional risks and operating costs.\nA reclassification of our freelance professionals from independent contractors to employees by tax authorities could require us to pay retroactive taxes and penalties and significantly increase our cost of operations.\nWe contract with freelance professionals as independent contractors to create the substantial majority of the content for our owned and operated online properties and for our customers\u2019 online properties. Because we consider our freelance professionals with whom we contract to be independent contractors, as opposed to employees, we do not withhold federal or state income or other employment related taxes, make federal or state unemployment tax or Federal Insurance Contributions Act payments, or provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance with respect to such freelance professionals. Our contracts with our independent contractor freelance professionals obligate these freelance professionals to pay these taxes. The classification of freelance professionals as independent contractors depends on the facts and circumstances of the relationship. In the event of a determination by federal or state taxing authorities that the freelance professionals engaged as independent contractors are employees, we may be adversely affected and subject to retroactive taxes and penalties. In addition, if it was determined that our content creators were employees, the costs associated with content creation would increase significantly and our financial results would be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Owning Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and an active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not be sustained.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and is likely to be, highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. For example, from the date of our initial public offering in January 2011 through March 5, 2015, our closing stock price, as adjusted for the Distribution and the 1-for-5 reverse stock split, has ranged from $4.05 to $48.75. In addition, an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained, which could depress the market price of our common stock.\nFollowing the Separation, the price at which our common stock trades may fluctuate significantly while the market continues to evaluate the two companies with different growth profiles and operating margins separately. Further, shares of our common stock will represent an investment in a smaller public company and this change may not meet some stockholders\u2019 investment strategies or requirements, which could cause investors to sell their shares of our common stock. Excessive selling could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease. Additionally, as a result of the reverse stock split reducing the number of shares of our common stock that are outstanding, we may have a lower average daily trading volume, which could lead to greater volatility in the trading price of our common stock.\nIn addition to the factors discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this report, factors that may cause the trading price of our common stock to be volatile include:\n\u00b7\nour operating performance and the operating performance of similar companies;\n\u00b7\nthe overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u00b7\nthe number of shares of our common stock publicly owned and available for trading;\n\u00b7\nany major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u00b7\npublication of research reports about us or our industries or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n\u00b7\npublication of third-party reports relating to the performance of our business or certain key operating metrics;\n\u00b7\nlarge volumes of sales of our shares of common stock by existing stockholders; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral political and economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for Internet-related companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a company\u2019s securities. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs, divert our management\u2019s attention and resources and harm our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nThe large number of shares eligible for public sale or subject to rights requiring us to register them for public sale could depress the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price of our common stock. As of March 5, 2015, we had 19,802,470 shares of common stock outstanding (excluding shares held in treasury).\nCertain stockholders owning a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock are party to a stockholders agreement that entitles them to require us to register shares of our common stock owned by them for public sale in the United States, subject to the restrictions of Rule 144. In addition, certain stockholders, including investors in our preferred stock that converted into common stock as well as current and former employees, are eligible to resell shares of common stock under Rule 144 and Rule 701 without registering such shares with the SEC. Sales of our common stock as restrictions end or pursuant to registration rights may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales also could cause our stock price to fall and make it more difficult for shareholders to sell shares of our common stock.\nIn addition, as of March 5, 2015 we have over nine million shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans, of which approximately five million shares are registered under our registration statement on Form S-8 on file with the SEC. Subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods, vesting requirements and, in certain cases, performance conditions, the shares of registered common stock issued upon exercise of outstanding options, vesting of future awards or pursuant to purchases under our employee stock purchase plan (the \u201cESPP\u201d) will be available for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nWe also have previously and may from time to time in the future issue shares of our common stock as consideration for acquisitions and investments. If any such acquisition or investment is significant, the number of shares that we may issue may in turn be significant. We currently have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC which we may use to issue debt or equity securities with an aggregate offering price not to exceed $100 million and under which certain selling stockholders may offer and sell up to 2.8 million shares of our common stock.\nOur stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our common stock.\nOur board of directors previously approved a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to $50.0 million of our common stock, of which approximately $19.2 million remains available as of December 31, 2014. Such stock repurchases may be limited, suspended, or terminated at any time without prior notice, and we have not repurchased any shares of our common stock since April 2013. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase additional shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program or that any future repurchases will have a positive impact on the trading price of our common stock or earnings per share. Important factors that could cause us to limit, suspend or terminate our stock repurchase program include, among others, unfavorable market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, the nature of other investment or strategic opportunities presented to us from time to time, the rate of dilution of our equity compensation programs, the availability of adequate funds, and our ability to make appropriate, timely, and beneficial decisions as to when, how, and whether to purchase shares under the stock repurchase program. If we limit, suspend or terminate our stock repurchase program, our stock price may be negatively affected.\nAs a public company, we are subject to compliance initiatives that require substantial time from our management and result in significantly increased costs.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, and other rules implemented by the SEC and the NYSE, impose various requirements on public companies, including requirements related to certain corporate governance practices. Compliance with these rules and regulations has resulted in significantly increased costs for us as a public company than we incurred as a private company, including substantially higher costs to obtain comparable levels of director and officer liability insurance. Proposed corporate governance laws and regulations under consideration may further increase our compliance costs. If compliance with these various legal and regulatory requirements diverts our management\u2019s attention from other\nbusiness concerns, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, these laws and regulations may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors, on committees of our board of directors, or as executive officers.\nWe are required to make an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. We are also required to obtain an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting from our independent registered public accounting firm. Section 404 requires us to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting for each fiscal year. Our testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. If we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404, management may not be able to assess whether our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, which may subject us to adverse regulatory consequences and could result in a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements. In addition, if we fail to maintain effective controls and procedures, we may be unable to provide the required financial information in a timely and reliable manner or otherwise comply with the standards applicable to us as a public company. Any failure by us to provide the required financial information in a timely and reliable manner could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and the trading price of our securities. In addition, we may incur additional expenses and commitment of management\u2019s time in connection with further assessments of our compliance with the requirements of Section 404, which could materially increase our operating expenses and adversely impact our results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nWe do not anticipate paying cash dividends and, accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the future. As a result, only appreciation of the price of our common stock, which may never occur, will provide a return to stockholders. Investors seeking cash dividends should not invest in our common stock.\nCertain provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors, including, among other things:\n\u00b7\na classified board of directors with three-year staggered terms, which may delay the ability of stockholders to change the membership of a majority of our board of directors;\n\u00b7\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our board of directors to determine to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquiror;\n\u00b7\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u00b7\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent, which forces stockholder action to be taken at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders;\n\u00b7\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors, the Chief Executive Officer, the president (in absence of a Chief Executive Officer) or our board of directors, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u00b7\nthe requirement for the affirmative vote of holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of all of the then outstanding shares of the voting stock, voting together as a single class, to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to the issuance of preferred stock and management of our business or our amended and restated bylaws, which may inhibit the ability of an acquiror from amending our certificate of incorporation or bylaws to facilitate a hostile acquisition;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our board of directors, by majority vote, to amend the bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent a hostile acquisition and inhibit the ability of an acquiror from amending the bylaws to facilitate a hostile acquisition; and\n\u00b7\nadvance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us.\nWe are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, our board of directors has approved the transaction.", "PERMNO": 12521, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "LEAF"}
