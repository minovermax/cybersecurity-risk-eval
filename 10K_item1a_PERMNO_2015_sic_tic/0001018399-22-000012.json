{"cik": "1018399", "company": "ENTERPRISE BANCORP INC /MA/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nAn investment in the Company's common stock is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties including, without limitation, those set forth below, any of which could cause the Company's actual results to vary materially from recent results or from the other forward-looking statements that the Company may make from time to time in news releases, periodic reports and other written or oral communications. This Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.\nRealization of any of the risks outlined in the following sections, or additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of, or may currently deem immaterial, may impair the Company's business in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, any one or a combination of the following consequences: loss of assets; an interruption in the ability to conduct business and process transactions; loss of customer business; loss of key personnel; additional regulatory scrutiny and potential enforcement actions and/or penalties against the Company or the Bank; limit the payment of dividends; damage the Company's reputation; expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability; result in unanticipated charges against capital; increase operational costs; decrease revenue; restrict funding sources, which could adversely impact the Company's ability to meet cash needs; force the Company to liquidate investments or other assets; limit growth and branch network expansion; close locations or reduce staffing; or limit permissible activities. As a result, the Company's overall business, financial condition, results of operations, capital position, liquidity position, and financial performance could be materially and adversely affected. If this were to happen, the value of the Company's common stock could decline significantly, and shareholders could lose some or all their investment.\nThe material risks and uncertainties that management believes may affect the Company are outlined below. These risks and uncertainties are not listed in any order of priority and are not necessarily the only ones facing the Company.\nRISK MANAGEMENT CONTROLS\nRisk Management Controls and Procedures Could Fail or Be Circumvented\nManagement regularly reviews and updates the Company's internal controls, corporate governance policies, compensation policies, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and security controls to prevent and detect errors and potential monetary losses, loss of confidential information and data, and loss of physical assets by theft, malicious destruction or damage, fraud, or robbery from both internal and external sources. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. The Company is at risk of ineffective design of internal controls, any circumvention of the Company's internal controls and procedures, whether intentional or unintentional, or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures, or failure to adequately execute controls and procedures, whether by employees, management, directors, or external elements, or any illegal activity conducted by a Bank customer or employee.\nCOVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe ongoing resurgence in reported COVID-19 cases, and any current or future variants thereof, continues to have an impact on our local operating markets and may also have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as more specifically discussed below.\nPandemic's Impact on Lending, Credit, Liquidity, and Interest Rate Risks\nAs local economies reopened during 2021 and businesses continued to ramp up operations, many have experienced severe shortfalls in rehiring adequate staff to operate at previous business levels, as well as increased cost of materials and supply chain disruptions, impacting their business scale and continued financial viability. In addition, the shift to a remote workforce may have long-term implications for how many businesses operate and in turn, their need for leased office space may contract. This threatened financial viability and reduced need for office space could result in a reduction in our loan\ndemand, lower real estate collateral values, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation.\nThe long-term impact of the pandemic on the credit quality of our loan portfolio may be influenced by a variety of factors including the depth and duration of any economic contraction, labor shortages, inflation and government actions, declines in commercial real estate values, supply chain disruptions, and the extent of financial support by Federal or State governments. We will continue to closely monitor the effect of the ongoing pandemic across all industry sectors in our diversified loan portfolio and its impact on our customers' ability to repay their loans as the results continue to unfold in future quarters. The credit quality of our loans could be further impacted, and additional provisions may be necessary.\nThe Company\u2019s balance of lower-yielding short-term and overnight investments has increased due to funds received for PPP loan forgiveness and deposit growth. The increase in liquidity has occurred while interest rates have been at historically low levels. The immediate impact of carrying high liquidity as short term and overnight investments is a lowering of net interest margin. Investing these funds in the current low-rate environment could expose the Company to increased interest rate risk. The Federal Reserve Bank has indicated an intention to increase the Fed Funds target rate beginning potentially in March 2022.\nPandemic's Impact on Technology & Information Systems, and Operations Risks\nThe spread of the pandemic has also caused the Company, like many other businesses, to modify our physical business practices, turning instead to limited physical interaction and to working remotely with a dependence on technology and internet connectivity for many communications. Technology and cybersecurity in customers\u2019 and employees\u2019 homes may be more limited or less reliable than doing business in our offices. These modifications may heighten cybersecurity and information systems risk, including increases in: phishing, malware, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks; vulnerability to disruptions of our information technology infrastructure, internet, and telecommunications systems for remote operations; unauthorized dissemination of confidential customer information; inability to restore the systems in the event of a systems failure, denial of service attacks, or interruption; security breaches resulting in potential impairment of our ability to perform critical functions; all of which could expose the Company to risks of data or financial loss, litigation and liability and could seriously disrupt our operations and the operations of any impacted business partners and customers, and damage our reputation.\nThe physical modifications made in our business practices in response to the pandemic may not be sustainable over extended periods of time. Variants may continue to emerge causing further surges in COVID-19 cases impacting our staffing levels and, branch locations may be unable to open or provide customers with an expected high level of in-person customer service, and business development efforts may be reduced or eliminated leading to a decline in growth, and operational areas may become understaffed, leading to a decrease in transaction processing and operations.\nThe long-term consequences of the pandemic experienced by our customers and businesses may further exacerbate some of the risks identified through this \"Item 1A - Risk Factors.\"\nLENDING\nThere are inherent risks associated with the Company's lending activities. These risks include, among other things, the impact of changes in the economic conditions in the market areas in which the Company operates and changes in interest rates. In addition, the Company may be impacted by the following risks associated with its lending activities:\nCommercial Lending Generally Involves a Higher Degree of Risk than Retail Residential Mortgage Lending\nThe Company's loan portfolio consists primarily of commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, and commercial construction loans. These types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than owner-occupied residential real estate loans or consumer loans, and typically have larger balances. The underlying commercial real estate values, the lower demand for office and retail space, the actual costs necessary to complete a construction project, or customer cash flow and payment expectations on such loans can be more easily influenced by adverse conditions in the related industries, the real estate market or in the economy and are dependent on the skills and experience of the business' management team.\nThe Company May Need to Increase its Allowance for Credit Losses\nThe determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires the Company to make significant estimates of current credit risks, non-performing trends, and\nreasonable and supportable forecasts, all of which may undergo material changes. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the Company's allowance for credit losses and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments that may differ from those of the Company's management.\nIncreases in the Company's Non-performing Assets Could Adversely Affect the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Condition in the Future\nNon-performing assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. No interest income is recorded on non-accrual loans or other real estate owned, thereby adversely affecting income and returns on assets and equity. In addition, loan administration and workout costs increase, including significant time commitments from management and staff, resulting in additional reductions of earnings. When taking collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings, the Company is required to carry the property or loan at its then-estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell, which, when compared to the carrying value of the loan, may result in a loss. In addition, any errors in documentation or previously unknown defects in deeds may impact the Company's ability to perfect title of the collateral in foreclosure. These non-performing loans and other real estate owned assets also increase the Company's risk profile and the capital that regulators believe is appropriate in light of such risks and have an impact on the Company's FDIC risk-based deposit insurance premium rate.\nThe Company's Use of Appraisals in Deciding Whether to Make a Loan Does Not Ensure the Value of the Collateral\nIn considering whether to make a loan secured by real property or other business assets, the sale of which may provide ultimate recovery of the outstanding balance of the loan, the Company generally requires an internal evaluation or independent appraisal of the collateral supporting the loan. However, these assessment methods are only an estimate of the value of the collateral at the time the assessment is made and involve estimates and assumptions. An error in fact, estimate or judgment could adversely affect the reliability of the valuation. Furthermore, changes in those estimates due to the economic environment and events occurring after the initial assessment, may cause the value of the collateral to differ significantly from the initial valuations. As a result, the value of collateral securing a loan may be less than estimated at the time of assessment, and if a default occurs the Company may not recover the outstanding balance of the loan.\nThe Company is Subject to Environmental Risks Associated with Real Estate Held as Collateral or Occupied\nWhile the Company\u2019s lending, foreclosure and facilities policies and guidelines are intended to exclude properties with an unreasonable risk of contamination, hazardous substances could exist on some of the properties that the Company may own, acquire, manage, or occupy. Environmental laws could force the Company to clean up the properties at the Company\u2019s expense. It may cost much more to clean a property than the property is worth, and it may be difficult or impossible to sell contaminated properties. The Company could also be liable for pollution generated by a borrower\u2019s operations if the Company takes a role in managing those operations after a default.\nConcentrations in Commercial Real Estate Loans are Subject to Heightened Risk Management and Regulatory Review\nIf a concentration in commercial real estate lending is present, as measured under government banking regulations, management must employ heightened risk management lending practices that address the following key elements: board and management oversight and strategic planning, portfolio management, development of underwriting standards, portfolio risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing, and maintenance of increased capital levels as needed to support the level of commercial real estate lending. If a concentration is determined to exist, the Company may incur additional operating expenses in order to comply with additional risk management practices and increased capital requirements.\nECONOMICS & FINANCIAL MARKETS\nThe Company's financial results are impacted by the general economic conditions of the primary market areas in which the Company operates. Any weakening in general economic conditions in the New England region, long-term deterioration of the regional economy or the local impact from national economic conditions or geopolitical instability could negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company's Investment Portfolio Could Incur Losses or Fair Value Could Deteriorate\nThere are inherent risks associated with the Company's investment activities. These risks include the impact from changes in interest rates, credit risk related to weakness in real estate values, municipalities, government sponsored enterprises, or other industries, the impact of changes in income tax rates on the value of tax-exempt securities, adverse changes in regional or national economic conditions, and general turbulence in domestic and foreign financial markets, among other things. If an investment's value is in an unrealized loss position, the Company is required assess the security to determine if\na valuation allowance for the credit exposure of the debt security is necessary, which is recorded as a charge to earnings. These conditions could adversely impact the ultimate collectability of the Company's investments.\nIf market interest rates rise, the market value of the bond portfolio will decrease, resulting in unrealized losses, and depending on the extent of the rise in interest rates, the increase in unrealized losses could be significant over the short-term. The Company's bond portfolio is expected to mature at par and therefore the unrealized losses in the portfolio that result from higher market interest rates will decrease as the bonds become closer to maturity.\nThe Company is Subject to Interest Rate Risks\nThe Company's earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income, meaning the difference or spread between interest income earned and interest expense paid. Changes in interest rates could negatively impact the spread and demand for bank products as well as the market value of the fixed income bonds on its balance sheet. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the Company's control, including competition, the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve Bank, inflation and deflation, volatility of domestic and global financial and credit markets due to any number of factors including inflation and geopolitical tensions.\nA prolonged period of volatile and unstable financial market conditions could increase our funding costs and negatively affect our asset-liability management strategies. Higher volatility in interest rates and spreads to benchmark indices could cause decreases in the fair market values of our investment portfolio, and of assets the Company manages for others and may impair our ability to attract and retain funds from current and prospective customers, which could lower fee income. Fluctuations in interest rates could impact both the level of income and expense recorded on most of our assets and liabilities, and the market value of all interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, any of which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to fund future growth, our operating results, and financial condition.\nThe Company is subject to Inflation Risk\nUnlike an industrial company, virtually all assets and liabilities of the Company are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates, which are impacted by inflation, have a more significant impact on the Company's performance than the general level of inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction, or at the same magnitude, as the prices of other goods and services impacted by inflation.\nRefer to Item 7A. \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,\" below in this Form 10-K, for more information on the projected impact of interest rates on the Company\u2019s balance sheet at December 31, 2021. Inflation, which at December 31, 2021, has been reported at the highest level in nearly 40 years, could result in higher interest rates, which expose the Company to interest rate risk. The risks to our business from inflation depends on the durability of the current inflationary pressures in our markets. Transitory increases in inflation are unlikely to have a material impact on our business or earnings. However, more persistent inflation could lead to tighter-than-expected monetary policy which could, in turn, increase the borrowings costs of our customers, making it more difficult for them to repay their loans or other obligations. High interest rates may be needed to tame persistent inflationary price pressures, which could also push down asset prices and weaken economic activity. A deterioration in economic conditions in the United States and our markets could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and non-performing assets, decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for our products and services, all of which, in turn, would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere may be Additional Cost Associated with the London Interbank Offer Rate (\"LIBOR\") Transition\nA relatively small portion of the Company's assets and liabilities are indexed to LIBOR and our planning for the transition to the alternative Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") indicate that implementation is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's earnings. Publication of the one-week and two-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR stopped December 31, 2021, but publication of the overnight and one, three, six and 12 month USD LIBOR will continue until June 30, 2023.\nIn October 2021, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a Joint Statement on Managing the LIBOR Transition. In that guidance, the agencies offered their regulatory expectations and outlined potential supervisory and enforcement consequences for banks that fail to adequately plan for and implement the transition away from USD LIBOR. The failure to properly transition away from USD LIBOR may result in increased supervisory scrutiny. In addition, the implementation of USD LIBOR reform proposals may result in increased compliance costs and operational costs, including costs related to continued participation in USD LIBOR and the transition to a replacement SOFR reference.\nLIQUIDITY\nDeposit Outflows May Increase Reliance on Borrowings and Brokered Deposits as Sources of Funds\nThe Company has traditionally funded asset growth principally through deposits and borrowings. As a general matter, customer deposits are typically a lower cost source of funds than external wholesale funding (e.g., brokered deposits and borrowed funds), because interest rates paid for deposits are typically less than interest rates charged for wholesale funding. If the balance of the Company's customer deposits decrease relative to the Company's overall banking operations, the Company may have to rely more heavily on wholesale funding or other sources of external funding or may have to increase deposit rates to maintain deposit levels in the future.\nSources of External Funding Could Become Restricted and Impact the Company's Liquidity\nIf, as a result of general economic conditions or other events, sources of external funding become restricted or are eliminated, the Company may not be able to raise adequate funds or may incur substantially higher funding costs in order to raise the necessary funds to support the Company's operations and growth or may be required to sell or restrict operations, or restrict the payment of dividends.\nSee also \u201cPandemic's Impact on Lending, Credit, Liquidity and Interest Rate Risks\u201d above, regarding the increase in liquidity due to funds received for PPP loan forgiveness and deposit growth.\nINFORMATION & TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES\nThe use of technology related products, services, delivery channels, access points and processes expose the Company to various risks, particularly operational, privacy, cybersecurity, strategic, reputation and compliance risk. The ongoing move towards more cloud-based and third-party hosted technology solutions may subject the Bank to certain heightened cyber risks. Banks are required by regulatory agencies to prudently manage cyber, third-party, cloud-based and technology-related risks as part of their comprehensive risk management policies by identifying, measuring, monitoring, and controlling technology, information security and cybersecurity risk.\nFailure to Keep Pace with Technological Change Could Affect the Company's Profitability\nThe banking industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products, services, and delivery channels. Failure to successfully plan or keep pace with technological changes affecting the banking industry, or failure to adequately train and educate staff and customers on the use and risks of new technologies, or failure to comply adequately with regulatory guidance regarding information and cybersecurity could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and, in turn, the Company's financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there may be significant time and expenses associated with upgrading and implementing new technology, technology compliance, information security and cybersecurity processes.\nInformation Systems Could Experience an Interruption, Failure, Breach in Security, or Cyber-Attack\nThe Company relies heavily on public utilities infrastructures, internal information and operating systems, and cloud-base solutions and storage to conduct its business, and these systems could fail in a variety of ways. In addition, the use of network, cloud-based, or third-party hosted systems expose the Company to the increased sophistication and activity of cyber-criminals, both domestic and international. A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the information resources of the Company. These incidents may be an intentional attack or an unintentional event and could involve blocking the Company from accessing its own systems or remote servers in exchange for a ransom payment, gaining unauthorized access directly to our information systems, or indirectly through our vendors and customers systems or servers, for purposes of misappropriating assets, stealing confidential corporate information or customers' Personally Identifiable Financial Information, corrupting data, denying access or causing operational disruption. The Company's independent third-party service providers or their subcontractors may also have access to customers' personal information and therefore also expose the Company to cybersecurity risk. Additionally, vendors' and customers' home, business or mobile information systems and the servers they rely on, are at risk of fraudulent corporate account takeovers which the Company may not be able to detect. There is no guarantee the Company's counteractions will be successful or that the Company will have the resources or technical expertise to anticipate, detect or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks.\nThe occurrence of any failures or disruptions of infrastructure, or breakdown, breach, failures or interruptions of the Company's information systems, access points, or those hosted by third-party service providers and customers, or in the cloud, or the Company's inability to detect, respond, disclose and correct such occurrence or compromise in a timely\nmanner, could result in an interruption in our ability to conduct transactions for an indeterminable length of time, could expose customers' personal and confidential information to unauthorized parties, increase the risk of fraud or theft, subject the Company to increased operational costs to detect and rectify the situation, damage the Company's reputation and deter customers from using the Company's services, increase the Company insurance cost or the ability to obtain adequate insurance coverage, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny, and expose the Company to civil litigation and possible financial liability.\nOPERATIONS\nThe Company Operates in a Competitive Industry and Market Area\nThe Company faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors within its market area. Some of these competitors are larger and have more financial resources than the Company; some are not subject to the same degree of government regulation as the Company and thus may have a competitive advantage over the Company. If due to the inability to compete successfully within the Company's target banking markets, the Company encounters difficulties attracting and retaining customers or employees it would have a material adverse effect on the Company's growth and profitability.\nThe Company May Experience a Prolonged Interruption in its Ability to Conduct Business\nThe Company relies heavily on its personnel and facilities to conduct its business. A material loss of people or physical damage, destruction, or denial of access to our core operating facilities, for any number of reasons including localized natural disasters, global pandemics, demonstrations/pickets at facilities, or the local impact of geopolitical tensions, could result in prolonged business interruptions impacting customer services and our ability to conduct transactions.\nThe Company Relies on External Service Providers\nThe Company relies on independent third-party firms, including indirect vendors utilized by such third parties, to provide critical services necessary to conducting its business. These services include but are not limited to electronic funds delivery networks, check clearing houses, electronic banking services, wealth advisory, management and custodial services, correspondent banking services, information security assessments and technology support services, and loan underwriting and review services, among others. The occurrence of any failures or interruptions of the independent firms' systems or in their delivery of services, or failure to perform in accordance with contracted service level agreements, for any number of reasons could also impact the Company's ability to conduct business and process transactions.\nThe Company Relies on Financial Counterparty Relationships\nThe Company routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, in order to maintain correspondent bank relationships, liquidity, manage certain loan participations, mortgage sales activities, interest-rate swaps, engage in securities transactions, and engage in other financial activities with counterparties that are customary to our industry. Many of these transactions expose the Company to counterparty credit, liquidity and/or reputation risk in the event of default by the counterparty, or negative publicity or public complaints, whether real or perceived, about one or more of the Company's financial counterparties, or the financial services industry in general. Although the Company seeks to manage these risks through internal controls and procedures, the Company may experience loss or interruption of business as a result of unforeseen events with these counterparties.\nWealth Management Services Expose the Company to Financial, Operational and Legal Risk\nThe Company's Enterprise Wealth Management and Enterprise Wealth Services channels derive their revenues primarily from investment management fees based on assets under management. The Company's ability to maintain or increase investment assets under management is subject to a number of factors, including changes in client investment preferences, investment decisions by us or our third-party service provider partners, and various economic conditions, among other factors. Wealth management and wealth services clients can terminate their relationships with us, reduce their aggregate assets under management, or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons.\nInvestment performance is one of the most important factors in retaining existing clients and competing for new wealth management clients. Financial markets are affected by many factors, any of which could adversely impact the fair value of customer portfolios. Even when market conditions are generally favorable, our investment performance may be adversely affected by the investment style of our wealth management and investment advisors and the investment decisions that they make. Poor investment performance, whether real or perceived, in either relative or absolute terms, could impair our ability to attract and retain investment assets under management from existing and new clients.\nThe Company's Insurance Coverage May Not be Adequate to Prevent Additional Liabilities or Expenses\nThe Company works with an independent third-party insurance advisor to obtain insurance policies that provide coverage for a variety of business and cyber risks at coverage levels that compare favorably to bench-marked coverage for loss exposures that are faced by similarly sized financial institutions. However, there are no guarantees that the Company will be able to obtain or maintain comparable or adequate coverage levels in the future. In addition, there is no guarantee that the circumstances of an incident will meet the criteria for insurance coverage under a specific policy, and despite the insurance policies in place the Company may experience a material loss incident or event.\nSlower than Expected Growth in New Branches Could Adversely Affect the Company's Profitability\nNew branches and new products and services require a significant investment of both financial and personnel resources. Lower or slower than expected loan and deposit growth in new branches and/or lower than expected fee or other income generated from new branches could decrease anticipated revenues, increase costs, and reduce net income generated by such investments. Any potential future acquisitions could adversely affect the Company's profitability based on management's ability to successfully complete such acquisition and integration of the acquired businesses and increase the risk of losing key employees and customers. In addition, branch openings, relocations, and closings require the approval of various state and federal regulatory agencies, which may or may not approve the Company's application for a branch. Adding new branches in existing or new market areas could also divert resources from current core operations.\nThe Company May Not be Able to Attract, Retain or Develop Key Personnel\nThe Company's success and growth strategy depends, in large part, on its ability to attract, retain and develop top performing banking professional within our markets, and its ability to successfully identify and develop personnel for succession to key executive management positions and to the board of directors. The inability to do so could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business because of the loss of their skills, knowledge of the Company's market, years of industry or business experience and the difficulty of promptly hiring qualified replacements.\nREGULATION\nThe Company is Subject to Extensive Government Regulation and Supervision\nThe Company and the Bank are subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations that are primarily intended to protect consumers in the financial marketplace, provide fair and equal availability of products and services, preserve depositors' funds and the FDIC insurance fund, and to safeguard the banking system as a whole, and not necessarily the interests of shareholders. These regulations, including bank regulatory reform, tax policy and administration, and corporate governance rules, affect the Company's lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, growth, and net income, among other things. Federal and state laws and regulations may not always align in principle or statue, and preemptive federal laws may be more or less restrictive than those of a state. The Company cannot predict what legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on the financial condition or results of operations of the Company. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, negatively impact consumers' faith in the banking system leading them to seek out non-banking alternatives, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions.\nESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nThe Company's Financial Condition and Results of Operation Rely in Part on Management Estimates and Assumptions\nIn preparing the financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies, estimates and assumptions to be utilized. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported values of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and income and expenses for the years then ended. Changes in those estimates resulting from continuing change in the economic environment and other factors will be reflected in the financial statements and results of operations in future periods. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and be adversely affected should the assumptions and estimates used to be incorrect or change over time due to changes in circumstances. The three most significant areas in which management applies critical assumptions and estimates are the estimates of the allowance for credit losses, impairment review of investment securities and the impairment review of goodwill.\nThe Net Deferred Tax Assets (\u201cDTAs\u201d) May be Determined to be Unrealizable in Future Periods\nIn making its assessment on the future realizability of net DTAs, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including recent financial operations, projected future taxable income, and recoverable past income tax paid. If in\nthe future, management believes based upon historical and expected future earnings that it is more likely than not that the Company will not generate sufficient taxable income to utilize the DTA balance, then a valuation allowance would be booked against the DTA, with the write down offset to current earnings. Factors beyond management's control can affect future levels of taxable income and there can be no assurances that sufficient taxable income will be generated to fully realize the DTAs in the future.\nREPUTATION & LEGAL\nDamage to the Company's Reputation Could Affect the Company's Profitability and Shareholders' Value\nThe Company is dependent on its reputation within its market area as a trusted and responsible financial company for all aspects of its business with customers, employees, vendors, third-party service providers, and others with whom the Company conducts business or potential future business. Any negative publicity or public complaints, whether real or perceived, disseminated by word of mouth, by the general media, by electronic or social networking means, or by other methods, could harm the Company's reputation.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance Oversight May Influence Stock Price and Increase Compliance Costs\nInvestors have begun to consider how corporations are addressing environmental, social and governance matters, commonly known as \"ESG matters\" when making investment decisions. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, health and safety, diversity, labor conditions and human rights. For example, certain investors are beginning to incorporate the business risks of climate change and the adequacy of companies\u2019 responses to climate change, diversity of a company's board of directors, community involvement and charitable giving, the inclusion of ESG factors in the determination of executive compensation, and other ESG matters, as part of their investment decisions. These shifts in investing priorities may result in adverse effects on the trading price of the Company\u2019s common stock if investors determine, whether real or perceived, that the Company's ESG actions are not satisfactory. In addition, new government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure. Increased ESG related compliance costs could result in increases to our overall operational costs.\nThe Company is Exposed to Legal Claims and Litigation\nThe Company is subject to legal challenges under a variety of circumstances in the course of its normal business practices. Regardless of the scope or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, the Company may have to engage in litigation that could be expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to the Company's operations, and distracting to management. Whether claims or legal action are founded or unfounded, if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Company, they may result in significant financial liability, damage the Company's reputation, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny and restrictions, and/or adversely affect the market perception of our products and services, as well as impact customer demand for those products and services.\nCOMMON STOCK, SHAREHOLDER\u2019S EQUITY, CAPITAL\nThe Trading Volume in the Company's Common Stock is Less Than That of Larger Companies\nAlthough the Company's common stock is listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market, the trading volume in the Company's common stock is substantially less than that of larger companies. Given the lower trading volume of the Company's common stock, significant purchases or sales of the Company's common stock, or the expectation of such purchases or sales, could cause significant movement in the Company's stock price.\nThe Company's Capital Levels Could Fall Below Regulatory Minimums\nIf the Company's regulatory capital levels decline, or if regulatory requirements increase, and the Company is unable to raise additional capital to offset that decline or meet the increased requirements, then its regulatory capital ratios may fall below regulatory minimum capital adequacy levels.\nThe Company's failure to remain \"well-capitalized\" for bank regulatory purposes could affect customer confidence, restrict the Company's ability to grow (both assets and branching activity), increase the Company's costs of funds and FDIC insurance expense, prohibit the Company's ability to pay dividends on common shares, and restrict its ability to make acquisitions, among other impacts. Under FDIC rules, if the Bank ceases to be a \"well-capitalized\" institution, its ability to accept brokered deposits and the interest rates that it pays may be restricted. The Basel III Rules establish, among other rules, a \"capital conservation buffer\" of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum risk-based capital requirements. An institution\nwill be subject to limitations on certain activities, including payment of dividends, share repurchases and discretionary bonuses to executive officers, if its capital level is below the buffered ratio.\nThe Company's Articles of Organization, By-Laws and Shareholders Rights Plan as Well as Certain Banking and Corporate Laws Could Have an Anti-Takeover Effect\nAlthough management believes that certain anti-takeover strategies are in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders, provisions of the Company's articles of organization, by-laws, and shareholders rights plan and certain federal and state banking laws and state corporate laws, including regulatory approval requirements for any acquisition of control of the Company, could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire the Company, even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to the Company's shareholders. The combination of these provisions is intended to prohibit a non-negotiated merger, or other business combination involving an acquisition of the Company, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of the Company's common stock.\nDirectors and Executive Officers Own a Significant Portion of Common Stock\nThe Company's directors and executive officers, as a group, beneficially own approximately 17% of the Company's outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2021. Management views this ownership commitment by insiders as an integral component of maintaining the Company's local and community-based ownership. However, as a result of this combined ownership interest, the directors and executive officers have the ability, if they vote their shares in a like manner, to significantly influence the outcome of all matters submitted to shareholders for approval, including the election of directors.\nThe Company Relies on Dividends from the Bank for Substantially All of its Revenue\nHolders of the Company\u2019s common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when, and if declared by our Board. Although the Company has historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so, and our Board may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future.\nThe Company is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank. It receives substantially all its revenue from dividends paid by the Bank. These dividends are the principal source of funds used to pay dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock and interest and principal on the Company\u2019s subordinated debt. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Company, and certain regulators may prohibit the Bank or the Company from paying future dividends if deemed an unsafe or unsound practice. If the Bank, due to its capital position, inadequate net income levels, or otherwise, is unable to pay dividends to the Company, then the Company will be unable to service its debt, pay obligations or pay dividends on the Company\u2019s common stock, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock.", "PERMNO": 90590, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "EBTC"}
