On January 1, 2016, we acquired PRHC and its subsidiaries, including DMS Health Technologies, Inc. (\u201cDMS Health\u201d), with these synergistic benefits in mind. Previously, we acquired MD Office on March 5, 2015, and Telerhythmics on March 13, 2014, which we subsequently sold on October 31, 2018. Acquisitions involve many complexities, including, but not limited to, risks associated with the acquired business\u2019 past activities, loss of customers, regulatory changes that are not anticipated, difficulties in integrating personnel and human resource programs, integrating ERP systems and other infrastructures, general under performance of the business under Digirad control versus the prior owners, unanticipated expenses and liabilities, and the impact on our internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. There is no guarantee that our acquisitions will increase the profitability and cash flow of Digirad, and our efforts could cause unforeseen complexities and additional cash outflows, including financial losses. As a result, the realization of anticipated synergies or benefits from acquisitions may be delayed or substantially reduced, and could potentially result in the impairment of our investment in these businesses.\nThere can be no assurances that we will successfully complete our planned conversion into a diversified holding company or complete our possible acquisition of ATRM Holdings, Inc.\nPart of our strategy is to become a diversified holding company through the acquisition of businesses that, we believe, will realize a material benefit from being part of a larger holding company structure, both financially and strategically. There can be no assurances that we will find suitable acquisition targets that will enable us to successfully realize our conversion into a diversified holding company, and even if such targets are identified, there can be no assurances that we can negotiate and complete such acquisitions on attractive terms, including with regard to the possible acquisition of ATRM.\nIf we are unable to make successful acquisitions, our ability to grow our business could be adversely affected and our conversion to a diversified holding company structure may not succeed. If we succeed in making suitable acquisitions, we may not be able to obtain the expected profitability or other benefits in the short or long term from such acquisitions.\nAcquisitions, including the possible ATRM acquisition, involve many complexities, including, but not limited to, risks associated with the acquired business\u2019 past activities, loss of customers, regulatory changes that are not anticipated, difficulties in integrating personnel and human resource programs, integrating ERP systems and other infrastructures under Company control, unanticipated expenses and liabilities, and the impact on our internal controls and compliance with the regulatory requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. There is no guarantee that our acquisitions will increase the profitability and cash flow of the Company, and our efforts could cause unforeseen complexities and additional cash outflows, including financial losses. As a result, the realization of anticipated benefits from acquisitions may be delayed or substantially reduced. In addition, our leadership team\u2019s attention may also be diverted by any historical or potential acquisitions.\nWe conduct certain operations through a joint venture and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. We may not be able to achieve anticipated benefits from joint ventures and disagreements with joint venture partners could adversely affect our interest in the joint ventures and lead to an unwinding of joint ventures.\nOn December 14, 2018, Digirad and ATRM entered into a joint venture and formed Star Procurement, LLC (\u201cStar Procurement\u201d), with Digirad and ATRM each holding a 50% interest. We may enter into additional joint ventures in the future. Joint ventures involve many complexities and there is no guarantee that our joint ventures will increase the profitability and cash flow of the Company. Our efforts could also cause unforeseen complexities and additional cash outflows, including financial losses. As a result, the realization of anticipated benefits from joint ventures may be delayed or substantially reduced.\nAdditionally, joint venture partners may have interests that are different from ours, which may result in conflicting views as to the conduct of the business of the joint venture. In the event that we have a disagreement with a joint venture partner as to the resolution of a particular issue to come before the joint venture, or as to the management or conduct of the business of the joint venture in general, we may not be able to resolve such disagreement in our favor and such disagreement could have a material adverse effect on our interest in the joint venture or the business of the joint venture in general.\nOur revenues may decline due to reductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates.\nThe success of our business is largely dependent upon our medical professional customers\u2019 ability to provide diagnostic care to their patients in an economically sustainable manner, either through the purchase of our imaging systems or using our diagnostic services, or both. Our customers are directly impacted by changes (decreases and increases) in governmental and private payor reimbursements for diagnostic services. We are directly and indirectly impacted by changes in reimbursements. In our businesses, where we are indirectly affected by reimbursement changes, we make every effort to act as business partners with our physician\ncustomers. For example, in 2010, we proactively adjusted our diagnostic imaging services rates down due to the dramatic reimbursement declines that our customers experienced from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Reimbursements remain a source of concern for our customers and downward pressure on reimbursements causes greater pricing pressure on our services and influences the buying decisions of our customers. Although the gap is closing, hospital reimbursements remain higher than in-office reimbursements. Our Diagnostic Imaging segment\u2019s products are targeted to serve the hospital market. A smaller portion of our Diagnostic Services business segment operates in the hospital market.\nReductions in reimbursements could significantly impact the viability of in-office imaging performed by independent physicians, as well as the viability of our cardiac event monitoring services business. The historical decline in reimbursements in diagnostic imaging has resulted in cancellations of imaging days in our Diagnostic Services business and the delay of purchase and service decisions by our existing and prospective customers in our Diagnostic Imaging business.\nOur Diagnostic Services revenues may decline due to changes in diagnostic imaging regulations and the use of third party benefit managers by states and private payors to drive down diagnostic imaging volumes.\nNuclear medicine is a \u201cdesignated health service\u201d under the federal physician self-referral prohibition law known as the \u201cStark Law,\u201d which states that a physician may not refer designated health services to an entity with which the physician or an immediate family member has a financial relationship, unless a statutory exception applies. Our business model and service agreements are structured to enable our physician customers to meet the statutory in-office ancillary services (\u201cIOAS\u201d) exception to the Stark Law, allowing them to perform nuclear diagnostic imaging services on their patients in the convenience of their own office. From time-to-time, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Congress have proposed to modify the IOAS to further limit or eliminate this exception. Various lobbying organizations, including the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (\u201cMedPAC\u201d), in the past have pushed for, discussed, and recommended that Congress limit the availability of the IOAS exception in order to reduce federal healthcare costs. Legislation has been introduced in prior Congresses to modify or eliminate the exception, but has not been enacted. The outcome of these efforts is uncertain at this time; however, the limitation or elimination of the IOAS exception could significantly impact our Diagnostic Services business segment as currently structured.\nOur customers who perform imaging services in their office also experience the continuing efforts by some private insurance companies to reduce healthcare expenditures by hiring radiology benefit managers to help them manage and limit imaging. The federal government has also set aside monies in the 2009 recession recovery acts to hire radiology benefit managers to provide image management services to Medicare/Medicaid and MedPAC has recommended and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has, in the past, proposed legislation requiring Medicare physicians who engage in a relatively high volume of medical imaging be required to obtain pre-authorization through a radiology benefit manager. A radiology benefit manager is an unregulated entity that performs various functions for private payors and managed care organizations. Radiology benefit manager activities can include pre-authorization for imaging procedures, setting and enforcing standards, approving which contracted physicians can perform the services, such as requiring even the most experienced and highly qualified cardiologists to obtain additional board certifications, or interfering with the financial decision of the private practitioner by requiring them to own their own imaging system and not allowing them to lease the system. The radiology benefit managers often do not provide written documentation of their decisions or an appeals process, leaving leasing physicians unable to challenge their decisions with the carrier or the state insurance department. Unregulated radiology benefit manager activities have and could continue to adversely affect our physician customers\u2019 ability to receive reimbursement, therefore impacting our customers\u2019 decision to utilize our Diagnostic Services imaging services.\nManufacturing and providing service for our nuclear imaging cameras is highly dependent upon the availability of certain suppliers, thereby making us vulnerable to supply problems that could harm our business.\nOur manufacturing process within Diagnostic Imaging, and our warranty and post-warranty camera support business, rely on a limited number of third parties to supply certain key components and manufacture our products. Alternative sources of production and supply may not be readily available or may take several months to scale-up and develop effective production processes. If a disruption in the availability of parts or in the operations of our suppliers were to occur, our ability to have gamma cameras built as well as our ability to provide support could be materially adversely affected. In certain cases, we have developed backup plans and have alternative procedures should we experience a disruption. However, if these plans are unsuccessful or if we have a single source, delays in the production and support of our gamma cameras for an extended period of time could cause a loss of revenue and/or higher production and support costs, which could significantly harm our business and results of operations.\nOur Diagnostic Services and portions of our Mobile Healthcare operations are highly dependent upon the availability of certain radiopharmaceuticals, thereby making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations that could harm our business.\nBoth our Diagnostic Service business and portions of our Mobile Healthcare business involve the use of radiopharmaceuticals. There is a limited number of major nuclear reactors supplying medical radiopharmaceuticals worldwide and there is no guarantee that the reactors will remain in good repair or that our supplier will have continuing access to ample supply of our\nradiopharmaceutical product. If we are unable to obtain an adequate supply of the necessary radiopharmaceuticals, we may be unable to utilize our personnel and equipment through our in-office service operations, or the volume of our services could decline and our business may be adversely affected. Shortages can also cause price increases that may not be accounted for in third party reimbursement rates, thereby causing us to lose margin or require us to pass increases on to our physician customers.\nOur business is not widely diversified.\nWe currently provide our mobile diagnostic services and sell our products primarily into the cardiac nuclear and ultrasound imaging private practice, in-office markets and hospitals. We may not be able to leverage our assets and technology to diversify our products and services in order to generate revenue beyond these. If we are unable to diversify our product and service offerings, our financial condition may suffer.\nWe compete against businesses that have greater resources and different competitive strengths.\nThe market for mobile diagnostic services and diagnostic imaging systems is limited and has experienced some declines in the past. Some of our competitors have greater resources and a more diverse product offering than we do. Some of our competitors also enjoy significant advantages over us, including greater brand recognition, greater financial and technical resources, established relationships with healthcare professionals, larger distribution networks, and greater resources for product development and capital expenditures, as well as more extensive marketing and sales resources. If we are unable to expand our current market share, our revenues and related financial condition could decline.\nOur quarterly and annual financial results are difficult to predict and are likely to fluctuate from period to period.\nWe have historically experienced seasonality in all of our businesses, volatility due to the changing healthcare environment, the variable supply of radiopharmaceuticals, and downturns based on the changing U.S. economy. While our customers are typically obligated to pay us for imaging days to which they have committed, our contracts permit some flexibility in scheduling when services are to be performed. We cannot predict with certainty the degree to which seasonal circumstances such as the summer slowdown, winter holiday vacations, and weather conditions may affect the results of our operations. We have also experienced fluctuations in demand of our diagnostic imaging product sales due to economic conditions, capital budget availability, and other financial or business reasons. In addition, due to the way that customers in our target markets acquire our products, a large percentage of our products are booked during the last month of each quarterly accounting period, and often there can be a large amount in the last month of the year. As such, a delivery delay of only a few days may significantly impact quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations. Moreover, the sales cycle for all of our capital products is typically lengthy, particularly in the hospital market, which may cause us to experience significant revenue fluctuations.\nWe spend considerable time and money complying with federal and state laws, regulations, and other rules, and if we are unable to fully comply with such laws, regulations, and other rules, we could face substantial penalties.\nWe are directly, or indirectly through our customers, subject to extensive regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business, including: the federal Medicare and Medicaid anti-kickback laws and other Medicare laws, regulations, rules, manual provisions, and policies that prescribe requirements for coverage and payment for services performed by us and our physician customers; the federal False Claims statutes; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended in 2009 under the HITECH Act that places direct legal obligations and higher liability on us with respect to the security and handling of personal health information; the Stark Law; the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; federal and state radioactive materials laws; state food and drug and pharmacy laws and regulations; state laws that prohibit the practice of medicine by non-physicians and fee-splitting arrangements between physicians and non-physicians; state scope-of-practice laws; and federal rules prohibiting the mark-up of diagnostic tests to Medicare under certain circumstances. If our customers are unable or unwilling to comply with these statutes, regulations, rules, and policies, rates of our services and products could decline and our business could be harmed. Additionally, new government mandates will require us to provide a certain baseline of health benefits and premium contribution for our employees and their families or pay governmental penalties. Some of these costs are not tax deductible. We have opted to provide this coverage to our employee base in order to maintain retention of qualified medical technicians and other professionals rather than plan to pay penalties to the government. Either option will result in additional costs to us and could negatively impact our cash reserves.\nWe maintain a compliance program to identify and correct any compliance issues and remain in compliance with all applicable laws, to train employees, to audit and monitor our operations, and to achieve other compliance goals. Like most companies with compliance programs, we occasionally discover compliance concerns. In such cases, we take responsive action, including corrective measures when necessary. There can be no assurance that our responsive actions will insulate us from liability associated with any detected compliance concerns.\nIf our past or present operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws, regulations, rules, or policies described above or the other laws or regulations to which we or our customers are subject, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from federal or state healthcare programs, or the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Similarly,\nif our physician customers are found to be non-compliant with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions that could have a negative impact on us. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment, or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business, and damage our reputation. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, regulations, rules, and policies, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security, and fraud laws may prove costly.\nHealthcare policy changes could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn response to perceived increases in healthcare costs in recent years, there have been and continue to be proposals by the federal government, state governments, regulators, and third-party payers to control these costs and, more generally, to reform the U.S. healthcare system. Certain of these proposals could limit the prices we are able to charge for our products or the amounts of reimbursement available for our products, and could limit the acceptance and availability of our products. The adoption of some or all of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nAny intrusions or attacks on our information technology infrastructure could impact our ability to conduct operations and could subject us to fines, penalties, and lawsuits related to healthcare privacy laws.\nThe operation of our business includes use of complex information technology infrastructures, access to the information technology networks of our customers, as well as the collection of storing of patient information that is subject to HIPAA. In recent years, attacks on corporate information technology infrastructures have become more common and more sophisticated. Attacks can range from attempts that are routinely blocked by security and related infrastructure, to intrusions that disrupt activity temporarily, to extensive intrusions that severely impact or disable a network, including \u201cransom\u201d ware that holds a network hostage until the impacted company pays a fee to the attacker. Further, attacks can specifically impact patient information stored on such networks, requiring a widespread notice to the affected population, which can be very costly. Any successful attack on our network could severely impact our ability to conduct operations and could result in lost customers. Though we carry customary insurance for notification events in the event of a patient information breach under HIPAA, our coverage may not be sufficient to cover every situation, and any notification could severely impact our customer confidence and operations.\nWe are subject to risks associated with self-insurance related to health benefits.\nTo help control our overall long-term costs associated with employee health benefits, we are self-insured up to certain limits for our health plans. As such, we are subject to risks associated with self-insurance of these health plan benefits. To limit our exposure, we have third party stop-loss insurance coverage for both individual and aggregate claim costs. However, we could still experience unforeseen and potentially significant fluctuations in our healthcare costs based on a higher than expected volume of claims below these stop-loss levels. These fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nA portion of our operations are located in a facility that may be at risk from fire, earthquakes, or other disasters.\nFinal assembly in our manufacturing process and significant portions of our inventory are located in a single facility in Poway, California, near known fire areas and earthquake fault zones. Future natural disasters could cause substantial delays in our operations and cause us to incur additional expenses. Although we have taken precautions to insure our facilities and continuing operations, as well as provide for offsite back-up of our information systems, this may not be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case. A disaster could significantly harm our business and results of operations.\nThe medical device industry is litigious, which could result in the diversion of our management\u2019s time and efforts, and require us to incur expenses and pay damages that may not be covered by our insurance.\nOur operations entail risks of claims or litigation relating to product liability, radioactive contamination, patent infringement, trade secret disclosure, warranty claims, vendor disputes, product recalls, property damage, misdiagnosis, breach of contract, personal injury, and death. Any litigation or claims against us, or claims we bring against others, may cause us to incur substantial costs, could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of our management from our core business, and harm our reputation. We may incur significant liability in the event of any such litigation, regardless of the merit of the action. If we are unable to obtain insurance, or if our insurance is inadequate to cover claims, our cash reserves and other assets could be negatively impacted. Additionally, costs associated with maintaining our insurance could become prohibitively expensive, and our ability to become or remain profitable could be diminished.\nIf we cannot provide quality technical and applications support, we could lose customers and our business and prospects will suffer.\nThe placement of our products and the introduction of our technology at new customer sites requires the services of highly trained technical support personnel. Hiring technical support personnel is very competitive in our industry due to the limited number of people available with the necessary scientific and technical backgrounds and ability to understand our technology at a technical level. To effectively support potential new customers and the expanding needs of current customers, we will need to expand our technical support staff. If we are unable to attract, train or retain the number of highly qualified technical services personnel that our business needs, our business and prospects will suffer.\nOur long-term results depend upon our ability to improve existing products and services and introduce and market new products and services successfully.\nOur business is dependent on the continued improvement of our existing products and services and our development of new products and services utilizing our current or other potential future technology. As we introduce new products and services or refine, improve or upgrade versions of existing products and services, we cannot predict the level of market acceptance or the amount of market share these products and services will achieve, if any. We cannot assure you that we will not experience material delays in the introduction of new products or services in the future.\nWe generally sell our products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards. If we do not develop new products and services and product enhancements based on technological innovation on a timely basis, our products and services may become obsolete over time and our revenues, cash flow, profitability and competitive position may suffer. Our success will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;\n\u2022allocate our research and development funding to products and services with higher growth prospects;\n\u2022anticipate and respond to our competitors\u2019 development of new products, services, and technological innovations;\n\u2022\ninnovate and develop new technologies and applications, and acquire or obtain rights to third-party technologies that may have valuable applications in the markets we serve;\n\u2022\nrecruit, train, retain, motivate, and integrate key personnel, including our research and development, manufacturing, and sales and marketing personnel; and\n\u2022\nsuccessfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner, price them competitively and manufacture and deliver sufficient volumes of new products of appropriate quality on time.\nEven if we successfully innovate and develop new products, services and product enhancements, we may incur substantial costs in doing so, and our profitability may suffer.\nIf we do not successfully manage the development and launch of new products and services, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe may face risks associated with launching new products and services. If we encounter development or manufacturing challenges or discover errors during our product development cycle, the product launch dates of new products and services may be delayed. The expenses or losses associated with unsuccessful product development or launch activities or lack of market acceptance of our new products and services could adversely affect our business or financial condition.\nUndetected errors or defects in our products could harm our reputation or decrease market acceptance of our products.\nOur products may contain undetected errors or defects when first introduced or as new versions or new products are released. Disruptions affecting the introduction or release of, or other performance problems with, our products may damage our customers\u2019 businesses and could harm their and our reputation. If that occurs, we may incur significant costs, the attention of our key personnel could be diverted, or other significant customer relations problems may arise. We may also be subject to warranty and liability claims for damages related to errors or defects in our products. In addition, if we do not meet industry or quality standards, if applicable, our products may be subject to recall. A material liability claim, recall, or other occurrence that harms our reputation or decreases market acceptance of our products could harm our business and operating results.\nOur ability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology through patents and other means is uncertain.\nWe rely on patent protection as well as trademark, copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property rights protection and contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technologies, all of which provide limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products. If we fail to protect and/or maintain our intellectual property, third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us, we may lose our technological or competitive advantage, and/or we may incur substantial litigation costs in our attempts to recover or restrict use of our intellectual property.\nWe do not have any pending patent applications. We cannot assure investors that we will continue to innovate and file new patent applications, or that if filed any future patent applications will result in granted patents. Further, we cannot predict how long it will take for such patents to issue, if at all. It is possible that, for any of our patents that have issued or that may issue in the future, our competitors may design their products around our patented technologies. Further, we cannot assure investors that other parties will not challenge any patents granted to us, or that courts or regulatory agencies will hold our patents to be valid, enforceable, and/or infringed. We cannot guarantee investors that we will be successful in defending challenges made against our patents and patent applications. Any successful third-party challenge or challenges to our patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents, or such patents being interpreted narrowly and/or in a manner adverse to our interests. Our ability to establish or maintain a technological or competitive advantage over our competitors and/or market entrants may be diminished because of these uncertainties. For these and other reasons, our intellectual property may not provide us with any competitive advantage. For example:\n\u2022we may not have been the first to make the inventions claimed or disclosed in our issued patents;\n\u2022\nwe may not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions. To determine the priority of these inventions, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d), which could result in substantial cost to us, and could possibly result in a loss or narrowing of patent rights. No assurance can be given that our granted patents will have priority over any other patent or patent application involved in such a proceeding, or will be held valid as an outcome of the proceeding;\n\u2022\nother parties may independently develop similar or alternative products and technologies or duplicate any of our products and technologies, which can potentially impact our market share, revenue, and goodwill, regardless of whether intellectual property rights are successfully enforced against these other parties;\n\u2022\nit is possible that our issued patents may not provide intellectual property protection of commercially viable products or product features, may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be challenged and invalidated by third parties, patent offices, and/or the courts;\n\u2022\nwe may be unaware of or unfamiliar with prior art and/or interpretations of prior art that could potentially impact the validity or scope of our patents or patent applications that we may to file;\n\u2022\nwe take efforts and enter into agreements with employees, consultants, collaborators, and advisors to confirm ownership and chain of title in intellectual property rights. However, an inventorship or ownership dispute could arise that may permit one or more third parties to practice or enforce our intellectual property rights, including possible efforts to enforce rights against us;\n\u2022\nwe may elect not to maintain or pursue intellectual property rights that, at some point in time, may be considered relevant to or enforceable against a competitor;\n\u2022\nwe may not develop additional proprietary products and technologies that are patentable, or we may develop additional proprietary products and technologies that are not patentable;\n\u2022\nthe patents or other intellectual property rights of others may have an adverse effect on our business; and\n\u2022\nwe apply for patents relating to our products and technologies and uses thereof, as we deem appropriate. However, we or our representatives or their agents may fail to apply for patents on important products and technologies in a timely fashion or at all, or we or our representatives or their agents may fail to apply for patents in potentially relevant jurisdictions.\nTo the extent our intellectual property offers inadequate protection, or is found to be invalid or unenforceable, we would be exposed to a greater risk of direct or indirect competition. If our intellectual property does not provide adequate coverage of our competitors\u2019 products, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business.\nThe measures that we use to protect the security of our intellectual property and other proprietary rights may not be adequate, which could result in the loss of legal protection for, and thereby diminish the value of, such intellectual property and other rights.\nIn addition to pursuing patents on our technology, we also rely upon trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. Despite these measures, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or misappropriated. In addition, we take steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, corporate partners and, when needed, our advisors. Such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and/or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements, and we may not be able to prevent such unauthorized disclosure. Moreover, if a party having an agreement with us has an overlapping or conflicting obligation to a third party, our rights in and to certain intellectual property could be undermined. Monitoring unauthorized and inadvertent disclosure is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to prevent such disclosure\nare, or will be, adequate. If we were to enforce a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets, it would be expensive and time consuming, the outcome would be unpredictable, and any remedy may be inadequate.\nIn addition, competitors could purchase our products and attempt to replicate and/or improve some or all of the competitive advantages we derive from our development efforts, willfully infringe our intellectual property rights, design their products around our protected technology or develop their own competitive technologies that fall outside of our intellectual property rights. If our intellectual property does not adequately protect our market share against competitors\u2019 products and methods, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business.\nWe may need to enter into license agreements in the future.\nWe may need or may choose to obtain licenses and/or acquire intellectual property rights from third parties to advance our research or commercialization of our current or future products, and we cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist that might be enforced against our current or future products in the absence of such a license. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses or intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In that event, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license replacement technology. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected products, which could materially harm our business and the third parties owning such intellectual property rights could seek either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation.\nIf we are sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, it would be costly and time consuming, and an unfavorable outcome in that litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur success also depends on our ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell our products and perform our services without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Numerous U.S. issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing products and services. As part of a business strategy to impede our successful commercialization and entry into new markets, competitors may allege that our products and/or services infringe their intellectual property rights.\nWe could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against claims of infringement made by third parties. Any adverse ruling by a court or administrative body, or perception of an adverse ruling, may have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business and our finances. Moreover, third parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive relief against us, which could block our ability to offer one or more products or services and could result in a substantial award of damages against us. Intellectual property litigation can be very expensive, and we may not have the financial means to defend ourselves.\nBecause patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be pending applications, some of which are unknown to us, that may result in issued patents upon which our products or proprietary technologies may infringe. Moreover, we may fail to identify issued patents of relevance or incorrectly conclude that an issued patent is invalid or not infringed by our technology or any of our products. If a third-party claims that we infringe upon a third-party\u2019s intellectual property rights, we may have to:\n\u2022\nseek to obtain licenses that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nabandon any product alleged or held to infringe, or redesign our products or processes to avoid potential assertion of infringement;\n\u2022\npay substantial damages including, in exceptional cases, treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, which we may have to pay if a court decides that the product or proprietary technology at issue infringes upon or violates the third-party\u2019s rights;\n\u2022\npay substantial royalties or fees or grant cross-licenses to our technology; or\n\u2022\ndefend litigation or administrative proceedings that may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.\nOur issued patents could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court or at the Patent Office or other administrative agency, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nAny patents we have obtained or do obtain may be challenged by re-examination or otherwise invalidated or eventually found unenforceable. Both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive. If we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent related to one of our products or services, the defendant in such litigation could counterclaim that our patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the U.S., defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace, as are validity challenges by the defendant against the subject patent or other patents before the USPTO. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement, failure to meet the written description requirement, indefiniteness, and/or failure to claim patent eligible subject matter. Grounds for an unenforceability\nassertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent intentionally withheld material information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Additional grounds for an unenforceability assertion include an allegation of misuse or anticompetitive use of patent rights, and an allegation of incorrect inventorship with deceptive intent. Third parties may also raise similar claims before the USPTO even outside the context of litigation. The outcome is unpredictable following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that no invalidating prior art existed of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. These assertions may also be based on information known to us or the Patent Office. If a defendant or third party were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the claims of the challenged patent. Such a loss of patent protection would or could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful.\nCompetitors may attempt to challenge or invalidate our patents, or may be able to design alternative techniques or devices that avoid infringement of our patents that have issued or that may issue in the future, or develop products with functionalities that are comparable to ours. In the event a competitor infringes upon our patent or other intellectual property rights, litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenge, even if successful, could be expensive and time consuming and could require significant time and attention from our management. We may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenges from others.\nAn adverse result in any such litigation proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated, being found to be unenforceable, and/or being interpreted narrowly and could impact the validity or enforceability positions of our other patents. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. In addition, an adverse outcome in such litigation or proceedings may expose us to loss of our proprietary position, expose us to significant liabilities, or require us to seek licenses that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe may make financial investments in other businesses that may lose value.\nAs we look for the best ways to deploy our capital and maximize our returns for our businesses and shareholders, we may make financial investments in other businesses or processes for purposes of enhancing our supply chain, creating financial returns, strategic developments, or other purposes. These investments may be speculative in nature, and there is no guarantee that we will experience a financial return and we may lose our entire principal balance if not successful.\nOur mobile healthcare fleet is highly utilized; any downtime in our assets could have a material impact on our revenues and costs.\nOur Mobile Healthcare business unit utilizes a fleet of highly sophisticated imaging and related transportation assets that require nearly 100% uptime to service our customer needs. Though we utilize an array of highly competent service providers to support our imaging fleet, imaging and related transportation machines can experience unproductive downtime. Any downtime of our imaging fleet could have near term impacts on our revenues and underlying costs.\nOur goodwill and other long-lived assets are subject to potential impairment that could negatively impact our earnings.\nA significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other long-lived assets, the carrying value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired. At December 31, 2018, goodwill and net intangible assets represented $7.0 million, or 13.8% of our total assets. In addition, net property, plant and equipment assets totaled $21.6 million, or 42.8% of our total assets. If actual results differ from the assumptions and estimates used in our goodwill and long-lived asset valuation calculations, we could incur impairment charges, which could negatively impact our earnings.\nWe review our reporting units for potential goodwill impairment annually or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. In addition, we test the recoverability of long-lived assets if events or circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable. Recoverability of long-lived assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. We conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations. There are numerous risks that may cause the fair value of a reporting unit to fall below its carrying amount and/or the value of long-lived assets to not be recoverable, which could lead to the measurement and recognition of goodwill and/or long-lived asset impairment. These risks include, but are not limited to, significant negative variances between actual and expected financial results, lowered expectations of future financial results, failure to realize anticipated synergies from acquisitions, adverse changes in the business climate, and the loss of key personnel. If we are not able to achieve projected performance levels, future impairments could be possible, which could negatively impact our earnings.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company derecognized $1.1 million of goodwill related to the termination of the Philips Agreements with DMS Health effective December 31, 2017. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded a $0.5 million and $0.2 million goodwill impairment loss, respectively, related to Telerhythmics, the Company\u2019s cardiac event monitoring services business that was acquired on March 13, 2014. On October 31, 2018, the Company entered into a membership interest purchase agreement (the \u201cTelerhythmics Purchase Agreement\u201d) with G Medical Innovations USA, Inc. (\u201cG Medical\u201d), pursuant to which we sold all the outstanding membership interests in Telerhythmics to G Medical. No other significant impairment losses on long-lived assets were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. See Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Note 7. Goodwill, within the notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding goodwill and long-lived assets.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nOn June 21, 2017, we entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement, as amended from time to time (the \u201cComerica Credit Agreement\u201d), with Comerica Bank, a Texas banking association (\u201cComerica\u201d). The Comerica Credit Agreement is a five-year revolving credit facility (maturing in June 2022), which, as amended, has a maximum credit amount of $20.0 million (the \u201cComerica Credit Facility\u201d). We used a portion of the financing made available under the Comerica Credit Facility to refinance and terminate, effective as of June 21, 2017, a certain Credit Agreement, dated January 1, 2016, by and among the Company, the subsidiaries of the Company, the lenders party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent.\nOur indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences for us and our stockholders. For example, the Comerica Credit Agreement requires a balloon payment at the termination of the facility in June 2022, which may require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to this future payment if we feel we cannot be successful in our ability to refinance in the future, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, and acquisitions, and for other general corporate purposes. In addition, our indebtedness could:\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and competitive pressures in our industry;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds on terms that are acceptable to us or at all.\nThe Comerica Credit Agreement governing our indebtedness contains restrictive covenants that will restrict our operating flexibility and require that we maintain specified financial ratios. We were not in compliance with certain covenants as of September 30, 2018 and although a waiver and an amendment to the Comerica Credit Agreement were obtained to address this noncompliance, we may be unable to obtain a waiver and or an amendment to the Comerica Credit Agreement for subsequent periods. If we cannot comply with these covenants, we may be in default under the Comerica Credit Agreement.\nThe Comerica Credit Agreement governing our indebtedness contains restrictions and limitations on our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. The Comerica Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that limit and restrict, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022incur additional debt;\n\u2022sell assets;\n\u2022incur liens or other encumbrances;\n\u2022make certain restricted payments and investments;\n\u2022acquire other businesses; and\n\u2022merge or consolidate.\nThough the Comerica Credit Agreement does not limit our ability to pay dividends, if there is insufficient cash generation of our business to satisfy our required financial covenants, or if there is a default or event of default under the Comerica Credit Agreement that has occurred and is continuing, the Company may be required to reduce or eliminate its quarterly cash dividend until compliance with the financial covenants can be met.\nThe Comerica Credit Agreement contains a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant and a leverage ratio covenant. At September 30, 2018, we were not in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant, and although a waiver and amendment was obtained to address noncompliance for this period, we may be unable to obtain a waiver and/or amendment if we are not in compliance in subsequent periods. Going forward, we may not have the ability to meet these and other covenants under the Comerica Credit Agreement depending on a number of factors including, without limitation, the performance of our business, capital allocation decisions made by the Company, or events beyond our control.\nOur failure to comply with our covenants and other obligations under the Comerica Credit Agreement may result in an event of default thereunder. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay the accelerated indebtedness (together with accrued interest and fees), or that we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. This could have serious consequences to our financial condition, operating results, and business, and could cause us to become insolvent or enter bankruptcy proceedings, and shareholders may lose all or a portion of their investment because of the priority of the claims of our creditors on our assets.\nSubstantially all of our assets have been pledged to Comerica as security for our indebtedness under the Comerica Credit Agreement.\nIn connection with the Comerica Credit Agreement, and pursuant to a separate Security Agreement dated June 21, 2017, between the Company, its subsidiaries and Comerica, the Comerica Credit Agreement is secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets (excluding real estate) of the Company and its subsidiaries and a pledge of all shares and membership interests of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default under the Comerica Credit Agreement, Comerica Bank may, among other things, declare the loans and all other obligations under the Comerica Credit Agreement immediately due and payable and increase the interest rate at which loans and obligations under the Comerica Credit Agreement bear interest. The exercise by Comerica of remedies provided under the Comerica Credit Agreement in the event of a default thereunder may have a material adverse effect on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of the Company and could cause the Company to become bankrupt or insolvent. In the event of any bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or similar proceeding against us, the assets that are pledged as collateral securing any unpaid amounts under the Comerica Credit Agreement must first be used to pay such amounts, as well as any other obligation secured by the pledged assets, in full, before making any distributions to our stockholders. In the event of any of the foregoing, our stockholders could lose all or a part of their investment.\nIf we are unable to generate or borrow sufficient cash to make payments on our indebtedness, our financial condition would be materially harmed, our business could fail, and shareholders may lose all of their investment.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance, which will be affected by economic, financial, competitive, business, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to meet our debt obligations or fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity or sell certain of our assets. We cannot assure you that we will be able to restructure or refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, which could cause us to default on our debt obligations and impair our liquidity. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely affect our results from operations and financial condition.\nThe Comerica Credit Facility interest rate floats with market interest rates. An increase in prevailing interest rates would have an effect on the interest rates charged on our variable rate debt, which rise and fall upon changes in interest rates. If prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates, the increased interest expense would adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur common stock may be subject to delisting from the Nasdaq Global Market if we do not meet Nasdaq\u2019s Minimum Bid Price Requirement.\nOn January 8, 2019, we received a deficiency letter from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department notifying us that, for the prior thirty consecutive business days, the closing bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) (the \u201cMinimum Bid Price Requirement\u201d). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rules, we have been given 180 calendar days, or until July 8, 2019 to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. If we do not regain compliance by July 8, 2019, we may transfer from The Nasdaq Global Market to The Nasdaq Capital Market and may be eligible for an additional compliance period of 180 days. To qualify for the additional compliance period, we will have to: (i) submit a transfer application and related application fees; (ii) meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards of The Nasdaq Capital Market (except for the bid price requirement); and (iii) provide written notice to Nasdaq of our intention to cure the deficiency during the additional 180-day compliance period by effecting a reverse stock split if necessary. If we do not qualify for an additional compliance period, or should we determine not to submit a transfer application or make the required representation, or if Nasdaq concludes that we will not be able to cure the deficiency, Nasdaq will provide written notice to us that our common stock will be subject to delisting.\nIf we choose to implement a reverse stock split, it must be completed no later than ten business days prior to July 8, 2019. There can be no assurance that our stockholders will approve a reverse stock split or that the reverse stock split will result in a sustained increase in the per share market price for the common stock so we can regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement.\nIf we do not regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by July 8, 2019 and we are not eligible for an additional compliance period at that time, the staff will provide written notification to us that our common stock will be subject to delisting. At that time, we may appeal the staff\u2019s decision to a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel (the \u201cPanel\u201d). We would remain listed pending the Panel\u2019s decision. There can be no assurance that, if we do appeal a subsequent delisting determination by the staff to the Panel, that such an appeal would be successful.\nIf we are not able to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement or do not transfer to The Nasdaq Capital Market, our common stock could be traded on an electronic bulletin board established for unlisted securities such as the Pink Sheets or the OTC Bulletin Board. In such event, it would become more difficult to dispose of, or obtain accurate price quotations for, our common stock, and there would likely be a reduction in our coverage by security analysts and the news media, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline further. Additionally, the sale or purchase of our common stock would likely be made more difficult and the trading volume and liquidity of our common stock would likely decline. A delisting from the Nasdaq would also result in negative publicity and would negatively impact our ability to raise capital in the future.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile, and the value of your investment could decline significantly.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been, and we expect it to continue to be, volatile. The price at which our common stock trades depends upon a number of factors, including our historical and anticipated operating results, our financial situation, announcements of new products by us or our competitors, our ability or inability to raise the additional capital we may need and the terms on which we raise it, and general market and economic conditions. Some of these factors are beyond our control. Broad market fluctuations may lower the market price of our common stock and affect the volume of trading in our stock, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business, or prospects. It is impossible to assure you that the market price of our shares of common stock will not fall in the future.\nOur common stock has a low trading volume and shares available under our equity compensation plans could affect the trading price of our common stock.\nOur common stock historically has had a low trading volume. Any significant sales of our common stock may cause volatility in our stock price. We also have registered shares of common stock that we may issue under our employee benefit plans or from our treasury stock. Accordingly, these shares can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to restrictions under the securities laws. If any of these stockholders, or other selling stockholders, cause a large number of securities to be sold in the public market without a corresponding demand, the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock. One or more stockholders holding a significant amount of our common stock might be able to significantly influence matters requiring approval by our stockholders, possibly including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions.\nThe protective amendment contained in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which is intended to help preserve the value of certain income tax assets, primarily tax net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d), may have unintended negative effects.\nPursuant to Internal Revenue Code Sections 382 and 383, use of our NOLs may be limited by an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. In order to protect the Company\u2019s significant NOLs, we filed an amendment to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company (as amended and extended, the \u201cProtective Amendment\u201d) with the Delaware Secretary of State on May 5, 2015. The Protective Amendment was approved by the Company\u2019s stockholders at the Company\u2019s 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 1, 2015.\nOn April 27, 2018, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company\u2019s Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which was approved by our stockholders at our 2018 Annual Meeting (the \u201cExtended Protective Amendment\u201d). The Extended Protective Amendment effects a three-year extension to the provisions of the Protective Amendment. The Extended Protective Amendment leaves the Protective Amendment unchanged in all respects, other than to extend the expiration date from May 1, 2018 to May 1, 2021, and to make revisions necessary as a result of the enactment of Public Law 115-97 (commonly referred to as the Tax Cut and Jobs Act) on December 22, 2017.\nThe Protective Amendment is designed to assist the Company in protecting the long-term value of its accumulated NOLs by limiting certain transfers of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Protective Amendment\u2019s transfer restrictions generally restrict any direct or indirect transfers of the common stock if the effect would be to increase the direct or indirect ownership of the common stock by any person from less than 4.99% to 4.99% or more of the common stock, or increase the percentage of the\ncommon stock owned directly or indirectly by a person owning or deemed to own 4.99% or more of the common stock. Any direct or indirect transfer attempted in violation of the Protective Amendment will be void as of the date of the prohibited transfer as to the purported transferee.\nThe Protective Amendment also requires any person attempting to become a holder of 4.99% or more of our common stock to seek the approval of our Board. This may have an unintended \u201canti-takeover\u201d effect because our Board may be able to prevent any future takeover. Similarly, any limits on the amount of stock that a shareholder may own could have the effect of making it more difficult for shareholders to replace current management. Additionally, because the Protective Amendment may have the effect of restricting a shareholder\u2019s ability to dispose of or acquire our common stock, the liquidity and market value of our common stock might suffer.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may prevent or delay removal of current management or a change in control.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may delay or prevent a change in control, discourage bids at a premium over the market price of our common stock, and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of our common stock. In addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. In general, Section 203 prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder unless certain specific requirements are met as set forth in Section 203. These provisions, alone or together, could have the effect of deterring or delaying changes in incumbent management, proxy contests, or changes in control.", "PERMNO": 90223, "SIC": 8071, "TIC": "DRAD"}
