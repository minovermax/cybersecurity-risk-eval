In addition to factors affecting our business that have been described elsewhere in this Form 10-K,\nany of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. We may update these risk factors in our periodic and other filings with the SEC.\nThe following is a summary of the principal risk factors described in this section:\n\u2022\nOur financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be materially adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19\npandemic.\n\u2022\nEconomic conditions could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022\nUnfavorable changes or conditions could occur in the states where our operations are concentrated.\n\u2022\nCOVID-19\nhas necessitated the delivery of certain healthcare services remotely via telehealth, which is subject to extensive federal and state regulation, as well as temporary waivers tied to the COVID-19\npublic health emergency.\n\u2022\nThe Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (\u201cMACRA\u201d) and potential changes to it may have a significant effect on our business.\n\u2022\nThe Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (\u201cPAMA\u201d) and potential changes to Medicare reimbursement enacted pursuant to the legislation may have a significant effect on our business.\n\u2022\nThe Transparency in Coverage Final Rule, which requires health plans to, beginning January 1, 2022, report to insureds upon request negotiated rates for all covered items and services and cost sharing obligations for in-network\nand out-of-network\nproviders, could have a material impact on our business.\n\u2022\nCongress or states have, and may continue to, enact laws restricting the amount out-of-network\nproviders of services can charge and recover for such services.\n\u2022\nExpanding eligibility of GHC Programs could adversely affect our reimbursement.\n\u2022\nGovernment-funded programs, private insurers, or state laws and regulations may limit, reduce, or make retroactive adjustments to reimbursement amounts or rates.\n\u2022\nWe may not find suitable acquisition candidates or successfully integrate our acquisitions. Our acquisitions may expose us to greater business risks and could affect our payor mix.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our same-unit and organic growth strategies.\n\u2022\nFailure to manage third-party service providers may adversely affect our ability to maintain the quality of service that we provide.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to litigation risks.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to collect reimbursements for our services from third-party payors.\n\u2022\nOur current indebtedness and any future indebtedness could adversely affect us by reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of any variable rate debt. In addition, a certain portion of our interest expense may not be deductible.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to successfully recruit, onboard and retain qualified physicians and other clinicians and other personnel, and our compensation expense for existing clinicians and other personnel may increase.\n\u2022\nOur employees and business partners may not appropriately secure and protect confidential information in their possession.\n\u2022\nChanges in federal and state information privacy and security laws could cause us to incur costs to comply, including potential changes to technology systems, legal and consulting services, and potential litigation risk.\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\nOur financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be materially adversely affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).\nThe outbreak of COVID-19\nevolved into a global pandemic that spread to most regions of the world, including virtually all of the United States. The full extent to which COVID-19\nwill impact our business and operating results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19\nand the actions to contain it or treat its impact, such as the potential for further shutdown or stay at home orders, and shifts toward GHC Programs if changes occur in population demographics within geographic locations in which we provide services, including an increase in unemployment and underemployment as well as losses of commercial health insurance.\nOur office-based practices, which specialize in maternal-fetal medicine, pediatric cardiology, and numerous pediatric subspecialties, saw a significant elevation of appointment cancellations compared to historical normal levels as a result of COVID-19.\nWe believe COVID-19,\neither directly or indirectly, has also had an impact on our NICU patient volumes, and there is no assurance that impacts from COVID-19\nwill not further adversely affect our NICU patient volumes or otherwise adversely affect our NICU and related neonatology business. Overall, our operating results were significantly impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic beginning in mid-March\n2020, but volumes did begin to normalize in May 2020 and substantially recovered during the months of June 2020 through December 2020.\nThe foregoing and other continued disruptions to our business as a result of COVID-19\ncould result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, prospects and the trading prices of our securities.\nEconomic conditions could have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur operations and performance depend significantly on economic conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the percentage of our patient service revenue being reimbursed under GHC Programs increased as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. If, however, economic conditions in the United States deteriorate, we could experience shifts toward GHC Programs, and patient volumes could decline. Further, we could experience and have experienced shifts toward GHC Programs if changes occur in population demographics within geographic locations in which we provide services. Adverse economic conditions could also lead to additional increases in the number of unemployed and under-employed workers and a decline in the number of private employers that offer healthcare insurance coverage to their employees. Employers that do offer healthcare coverage may increase the required contributions from employees to pay for their coverage and increase patient responsibility amounts. In addition, certain private payors\u2019 poor experience with the healthcare insurance exchanges and uncertainty around the future of the ACA and healthcare insurance exchanges may result in those payors exiting the healthcare insurance exchange marketplaces or the cessation of the healthcare insurance exchanges. As a consequence, the number of patients who participate in GHC Programs or who are uninsured or underinsured could increase. Payments received from GHC Programs are substantially less than payments received from private healthcare insurance programs (managed care and other third-party payors). Payments under policies issued through the healthcare insurance exchanges may be less than payments from private healthcare insurance programs and in some cases, patients\u2019 responsibility for costs related to healthcare\nplans obtained through the healthcare insurance exchanges may be high and could increase in the future, and we may experience increased bad debt due to patients\u2019 inability to pay for certain services. A payor mix shift from private healthcare insurance programs to GHC Programs or to healthcare insurance exchanges may result and has resulted in an increase in our estimated provision for contractual adjustments and uncollectibles and a corresponding decrease in our net revenue, as well as a significant reduction in our average reimbursement rates. While we have developed a number of strategic initiatives across our organization, in both our shared services functions and our operational infrastructure, to address some of the effects of changes in economic conditions, there is no assurance that these initiatives will be successful in generating improvements in our general and administrative expenses and our operational infrastructure. If these initiatives are unsuccessful, it could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.\nThe birth rate in the United States has declined and may decline further.\nFinal birth data for 2019 indicate that total births in the United States declined by approximately 1% as compared to 2018. Provisional data for 2020 is not yet available; however, we expect that birth trends at the hospitals where we provide services will continue to be soft in the near future. Future declines in births are possible and could have an adverse effect on our patient volumes, net revenue, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and the trading price of our common stock.\nUnfavorable changes or conditions could occur in the states where our operations are concentrated.\nA majority of our net revenue in 2020 was generated by our operations in five states. In particular, Texas accounted for approximately 29% of our net revenue in 2020. See Item 1. Business-\u201cGeographic Coverage.\u201d Adverse changes or conditions affecting these particular states, such as healthcare reforms, changes in laws and regulations, reduced Medicaid eligibility or reimbursements and government investigations, economic conditions, weather conditions, and natural disasters may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.\nThe value of our common stock may fluctuate.\nThere has been significant volatility in the market price of securities of healthcare companies generally that we believe in many cases has been unrelated to operating performance. In addition, we believe that certain factors, such as actual and potential legislative and regulatory developments, including announced regulatory investigations, quarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated results of operations, lower revenue or earnings than those anticipated by securities analysts, not meeting publicly announced expectations, general economic and financial market conditions, and the effect of short interest in our common stock could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.\nRisks Related to Governmental Changes and the Healthcare Regulatory Environment\nPotential healthcare reform efforts may have a significant effect on our business.\nThe ACA contains a number of provisions that have affected us and may continue to affect us over the next several years. These provisions include the establishment of health insurance exchanges to facilitate the purchase of qualified health plans, expanded Medicaid eligibility, subsidized insurance premiums and additional requirements and incentives for businesses to provide healthcare benefits. Moreover, we could be affected by potential changes to various aspects of the ACA, including changes to subsidies, healthcare insurance marketplaces and Medicaid expansion.\nThe ACA remains subject to continuing legislative and administrative flux and uncertainty. The law has faced many challenges, both legislative and legal, since its inception and may be subject to further modification. We cannot predict what impact, if any, further healthcare reform efforts or ACA changes may have on our business.\nIn 2021, the results of the federal and state elections have changed which persons and parties occupy the Office of the President of the United States and control both chambers of Congress and many states\u2019 governors and legislatures. The Biden Administration may propose sweeping changes to the U.S. healthcare system, including further changes to the ACA and further expanding government-funded health insurance options and replacing current healthcare financing mechanisms with systems that would be entirely administered by the federal government. Any legislative or administrative change to the current healthcare financing system could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.\nIn addition to the potential impacts to the ACA, there could be changes to other GHC Programs, such as a change to the structure of Medicaid. Congress and the Administration, in recent years, have sought to convert Medicaid into a block grant or to institute per capita spending caps, among other things. At least one state received approval for a block grant waiver from standard Medicaid requirements. These changes, if implemented, could eliminate the guarantee that everyone who is eligible and applies for benefits would receive them and could potentially give states new authority to restrict eligibility, cut benefits and make it more difficult for people to enroll. Additionally, several states are considering and pursuing changes to their Medicaid programs, such as requiring recipients to engage in employment or education activities as a condition of eligibility for most adults, disenrolling recipients for failure to pay a premium, or adjusting premium amounts based on income. Congress also could advance changes that result in more people being covered by Medicaid.\nMany states have recently shifted a majority or all of their Medicaid program beneficiaries into Managed Medicaid Plans. Managed Medicaid Plans have some flexibility to set rates for providers, but many states require minimum provider rates in their contracts with such plans. In July of each year, CMS releases the annual Medicaid Managed Care Rate Development Guide which provides federal baseline rules for setting reimbursement rates in managed care plans. We could be affected by lower reimbursement rates in some or all of the Managed Medicaid Plans with which we participate. We could also be materially impacted if we are dropped from the provider network in one or more of the Managed Medicaid Plans with which we currently participate. In Florida, more than 75% of the Medicaid population participates in a Managed Medicaid Plan, with even higher participation rates for children.\nWe cannot predict with any assurance the ultimate effect of these laws and resulting changes to payments under GHC Programs, nor can we provide any assurance that they will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. Further, any fiscal tightening impacting GHC Programs or changes to the structure of any GHC Programs could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.\nCOVID-19\nhas necessitated the delivery of certain healthcare services remotely via telehealth, which is subject to extensive federal and state regulation, as well as temporary waivers tied to the COVID-19\npublic health emergency.\nIn an effort to address shelter-in-place,\nquarantine, executive order or related measures to combat the spread of COVID-19,\nas well as the perceived need by individuals to continue such practices to avoid infection and to provide safe access to care for our patients, we have converted certain in-person\nvisits to telehealth visits. There is significant variation in demand, consumer acceptance, and market adoption of telehealth services, as well as the laws and regulations governing telehealth in the markets in which we operate. The provision of telehealth is largely regulated at the state level and can include, among other things, variations in the definition of telehealth, physician/patient relationship requirements, informed consent for telehealth services, licensure, scope of practice, covered modalities, electronic prescribing, coverage and reimbursement, and privacy and security requirements. Our ability to conduct telehealth services and provide medical services in a particular jurisdiction is directly dependent upon the applicable laws governing remote healthcare, the practice of medicine and healthcare delivery in general in such location, which are subject to changing political, regulatory and other influences. While numerous federal agencies have released waivers to ease regulatory obstacles to the adoption of telehealth,\nthese waivers do not override applicable state laws. States have adopted waivers as well but differ in the scope and application of such waivers and also on the time period the waiver is available. Many state waivers in relation to COVID-19\nhave already expired, despite the extension of the federal public health emergency declaration. Evolving interpretations and acceptance of telehealth by medical boards, state attorneys general and other regulatory or administrative bodies require us to monitor our compliance with law in every jurisdiction in which we operate, on an ongoing basis, and we cannot provide assurance that our activities and arrangements, if challenged, will be found to be in compliance with the law. Monitoring regulatory changes at the federal and state levels has and will continue to incur costs for us and may result in making changes to our business operations to ensure continued compliance. Challenges also exist with respect to coverage and reimbursement of telehealth services by both commercial and governmental payors. If telehealth services achieve coverage, there is no guarantee that reimbursement will be equivalent to in-person\ncare and may negatively impact our financial condition. Negative publicity in any of our markets concerning our products or services or the telehealth market as a whole could limit market acceptance of our services. Similarly, individual and healthcare industry concerns or negative publicity regarding patient confidentiality and privacy in the context of telehealth could limit market acceptance of our healthcare services when delivered remotely. If any of these events occur, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and the trading price of our securities.\nThe Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (\u201cMACRA\u201d) and potential changes to it may have a significant effect on our business.\nMACRA contains numerous measures that could affect us, including, requirements that physicians participate in quality measurement programs that differentiate payments to physicians under Medicare based on quality and cost of care, rather than the quantity of procedures performed. MACRA requires physicians to choose to participate in one of two payment formulas, MIPS or Alternative Payment Models (\u201cAPMs\u201d). Beginning in 2020, MIPS allowed eligible physicians to receive incentive payments based on the achievement of certain quality and cost metrics, among other measures, and be reduced for those who are underperforming against those same metrics and measures. As an alternative, physicians could choose to participate in an Advanced APM, and physicians who were meaningful participants in APMs could receive bonus payments from Medicare pursuant to the law. MACRA also remains subject to review and potential modification by Congress, as well as shifting regulatory requirements established by CMS. We currently anticipate that our affiliated physicians will continue to be eligible to receive bonus payments in 2021 through participation in the MIPS, although the amounts of such bonus payments are not expected to be material. We will continue to operationalize the provisions of MACRA and assess any further changes to the law or additional regulations enacted pursuant to the law.\nWe cannot predict with any assurance the ultimate effect of these laws and resulting changes to payments under GHC Programs, nor can we provide any assurance that they will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. Further, any fiscal tightening impacting GHC Programs or changes to the structure of any GHC Programs could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.\nThe Transparency in Coverage Final Rule, which requires health plans to, beginning January 1, 2022, report to insureds upon request negotiated rates for all covered items and services, and cost sharing obligations for in-network\nand out-of-network\nproviders, and could have a material impact on our business.\nBeginning January 1, 2022, health plans must begin reporting to their covered beneficiaries certain pricing information for covered items and services as well as the individual\u2019s cost-sharing obligations for those services. This rule aims to put health pricing information into the hands of consumers and allow them to select their providers based, in part, on cost. Through this final rule, plans and health insurers will be required to disclose on a public website their in-network\nnegotiated rates, billed charges and allowed amounts paid for out-of-network\nproviders, and the negotiated rate and historical net price for prescription drugs. Price reporting will expand to all services by January 1, 2024. We cannot predict how the availability of this health pricing information may\nimpact our business operations and patient volumes. If patients choose to use services of less costly providers, we could see a reduction in patient volumes or decide to reduce the prices of our services to compensate, either of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.\nState budgetary constraints and the uncertainty over the future of Medicaid could have an adverse effect on our reimbursement from Medicaid programs\n.\nThe ACA allowed states to expand their Medicaid programs through federal payments that fund most of the cost of increasing the Medicaid eligibility income limit from a state\u2019s historic eligibility levels to 133% of the federal poverty level. As of December 31, 2020, 38 states and the District of Columbia adopted the expansion of Medicaid eligibility. All of the states in which we operate, however, already cover children in the first year of life and pregnant women if their household incomes are at or below 133% of the federal poverty level. If states that expanded Medicaid reduce or eliminate eligibility for certain individuals, the number of patients who are uninsured could increase. Some states may seek to maintain expanded eligibility and to do so could offset the cost by further reducing payments to providers of services. In some states, we could experience delayed or reduced Medicaid payment for services furnished to program enrollees.\nCongress and the Biden Administration may also seek substantial reforms to Medicaid law and the ability of states to design Medicaid programs. Any changes, if enacted, could reduce or eliminate eligibility for certain individuals or reduce payments to providers of services. As a result, we could experience an increase in the number of uninsured patients and delayed or reduced Medicaid payment for services furnished to program enrollees.\nIn addition, many states are continuing to collect less tax revenue than they did historically and as a consequence continue to face budget shortfalls and underfunded pension and other obligations. Although shortfalls have been declining in more recent budgetary years, they are still significant by historical standards. The financial condition of the states in which we do business could lead to reduced or delayed funding for Medicaid programs and, in turn, reduced or delayed reimbursement for physician services, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAny changes to Medicaid eligibility, enrollment, financing or reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.\nCongress or states have, and may continue to, enact laws restricting the amount out-of-network\nproviders of services can charge and recover for such services.\nIn late 2020, Congress enacted legislation intended to protect patients from \u201csurprise\u201d medical bills when services are furnished by providers who are not subject to contractual arrangements and payment limitations with the patient\u2019s insurer. Effective January 1, 2022, patients will be protected from unexpected or \u201csurprise\u201d medical bills that could arise from out-of-network\nemergency care provided at an out-of-network\nfacility or at in-network\nfacilities by out-of-network\nproviders and out-of-network\nnonemergency care provided at in-network\nfacilities without the patient\u2019s informed consent. Many states have passed similar legislation, but the federal government has been working to enact a ban on surprise billing for quite some time.\nUnder the \u201cNo Surprises Act,\u201d patients are only required to pay the in-network\ncost-sharing amount, which will be determined through an established formula and will count toward the patient\u2019s health plan deductible and out-of-pocket\ncost-sharing limits. Providers will generally not be permitted to balance bill patients beyond this cost-sharing amount. An out-of-network\nprovider will only be permitted to bill a patient more than the in-network\ncost-sharing amount for care if the provider gives the patient notice of the provider\u2019s network status and delivers to the patient or their health plan an estimate of charges within certain specified timeframes, and obtains the patient\u2019s written consent prior to the delivery of care. Providers that violate these surprise billing prohibitions may be subject to state enforcement action or federal civil monetary penalties.\nThese measures could limit the amount we can charge and recover for services we furnish where we have not contracted with the patient\u2019s insurer, and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. Moreover, these measures could affect our ability to contract with certain payors and under historically similar terms and may cause, and the prospect of these changes may have caused, payors to terminate their contracts with us and our affiliated practices. Should any relationships with payors continue on an out-of-network\nbasis, the No Surprises Act requires that rate disputes be resolved through binding arbitration, in which both the payor and provider submit a requested rate and the arbitrator selects one submission without hearing or modification of the selected request. These unpredictable results will bind both the provider and payor for a 90-day\nperiod. We cannot predict the results of such proceedings, and the results could further affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.\nExpanding eligibility of GHC Programs could adversely affect our reimbursement.\nIn January 2018, Congress reauthorized the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (\u201cCHIP\u201d) through 2023 and then in February 2018 lengthened this funding extension through 2027. Changes to CHIP or the ACA\u2019s expansion of Medicaid coverage could cause patients who otherwise would have participated in private healthcare insurance programs to participate in GHC Programs, or vice versa, or cause patients who otherwise would have been covered by CHIP or Medicaid to lose insurance coverage altogether. Additional reform efforts, as well as legislative or administrative amendment or repeal of the ACA, could change the eligibility requirements for Medicaid and for other GHC Programs, including CHIP, and could increase the number of patients who participate in such programs or the number of uninsured patients.\nIn 2021, the results of the federal and state elections have affected which persons and parties occupy the Office of the President of the United States and control both chambers of Congress and many states\u2019 governors and legislatures. President Biden has proposed sweeping changes to the U.S. healthcare system, including expanding government-funded health insurance options and replacing current healthcare financing mechanisms with systems that would be entirely administered by the federal government.\nIn general, payments received from GHC Programs are substantially less than payments received from private healthcare insurance programs (managed care and other third-party payors). A shift in the mix of our payors from private healthcare insurance programs to government payors may result in an increase in our estimated provision for contractual adjustments and uncollectibles and a corresponding decrease in our net revenue, as well as a significant reduction in our average reimbursement rates. Additionally, if Congress does not act to extend CHIP beyond 2027, or if Congress extends CHIP but substantially alters the current program, we could be adversely affected if children in states where we do business lose Medicaid coverage or payments for services furnished to these children are delayed or reduced.\nGovernment-funded programs, private insurers or state laws and regulations may limit, reduce or make retroactive adjustments to reimbursement amounts or rates.\nA significant portion of our net revenue is derived from payments made by GHC Programs, principally Medicare and Medicaid, including the managed care plans under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These government-funded programs, as well as private insurers, have been and may continue to be subject to changes, including increased use of managed care organizations, value-based purchasing, and new patient care models to control the cost, eligibility for, use and delivery of healthcare services as a result of budgetary constraints and cost containment pressures due to unfavorable economic conditions, rising healthcare costs and for other reasons, including those described above under Item 1. Business-\u201cGovernment Regulation-Government Regulatory Requirements.\u201d Federal and state legislatures or administrators of these government-funded programs and private insurers may attempt other measures to control costs, including bundling of services and denial of, or reduction in, reimbursement for certain services and treatments. In addition, increased consolidation among private insurers is resulting in fewer and larger third-party payors with increased negotiating power. As a result, payments from\ngovernment programs or private payors may decrease significantly. Also, any adjustment in Medicare reimbursement rates may have a detrimental impact on our reimbursement rates not only for Medicare patients, but also for patients covered under Medicaid and other third-party payors, because a state\u2019s Medicaid payments cannot exceed the payments it would have made had those patients been enrolled in traditional Medicare, and other third-party payors often base their reimbursement rates on a percentage of Medicare rates.\nIn 2020, the federal Medicare agency announced changes in payments for physician services that would increase payment for services typically delivered by primary care providers, but that also would have reduced payment for many other specialty services. The impact of this change varied significantly across specialties, with some specialties potentially facing cuts of as much as 10%. Legislation enacted by Congress in December 2020 moderated the payment reductions for 2021 through 2023, but some of the relief mechanisms will be effective only in 2021, meaning physician service payments will face similar reductions again in 2022, unless Congress or the Medicare agency intervenes.\nOur business may also be materially affected by limitations on, or reductions in, reimbursement amounts or rates or elimination of coverage for certain individuals or treatments. Our business may also be materially affected by changes in medical codes for services that our affiliated clinicians provide if services under a new code are reimbursed at a lower rate. For example, the medical code for certain of our hearing screen services was recently changed by CMS to a code that could provide for lower reimbursement rates. While we have not yet experienced any material decrease in reimbursement rates as a result of this coding change, we are still evaluating the result of this change on our hearing screen contracts and ultimate effect of this coding change is not known at this time. Moreover, because government-funded programs generally provide for reimbursements on a fee-schedule\nbasis rather than on a charge-related basis, we generally cannot increase our revenue from these programs through increases in the amount we charge for our services. To the extent our costs increase, we may not be able to recover our increased costs from these programs, and cost containment measures and market changes in non-government-funded\ninsurance plans have generally restricted our ability to recover, or shift to non-governmental\npayors, these increased costs. In addition, funds we receive from third-party payors are subject to audit with respect to the proper billing for physician and ancillary services and, accordingly, our revenue from these programs may be adjusted retroactively. Any retroactive adjustments to our reimbursement amounts could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.\nIn addition, our agreements with certain third-party payors are terminable for various reasons. If an agreement with a third-party payor is terminated, we are generally required to seek reimbursement as an out-of-network\nprovider. In the event we attempt to balance-bill patients, we may be limited in our ability to do so by certain state laws and regulations. As these laws and regulations continue to develop in certain states, it could incentivize, and may have incentivized, certain third-party payors to terminate agreements as a business strategy which could lower overall reimbursement to providers. Any reductions in reimbursement amounts could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. Further, if a federal government shutdown were to occur for a prolonged period of time, federal government payment obligations, including its obligations under Medicaid and Medicare, may be delayed. Similarly, if state government shutdowns were to occur, state payment obligations may be delayed. If the federal or state governments fail to make payments under these programs on a timely basis, our business could suffer, and our financial position, results of operations or cash flows may be materially affected.\nWe may become subject to billing investigations by federal and state government authorities and private insurers.\nFederal and state laws, rules and regulations impose substantial penalties, including criminal and civil fines, monetary penalties, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and imprisonment, on entities or individuals (including any individual corporate officers or individual providers deemed responsible) that fraudulently or wrongfully bill government-funded programs or other third-party payors for healthcare services. CMS requires states to maintain a Medicaid Recovery Audit Contractor (\u201cRAC\u201d) program. States are\nrequired to contract with one or more eligible Medicaid RACs to review Medicaid claims for any overpayments or underpayments, and to recoup overpayments from providers on behalf of the state.\nFederal laws, along with a growing number of state laws, allow a private person to bring a civil action in the name of the government for false billing violations. See Item 1. Business- \u201cGovernment Regulation-Fraud and Abuse Provisions.\u201d Further, identified overpayments from Medicare or Medicaid must be refunded to the government within 60 days or the entity could be held liable under the federal FCA, including for treble damages and substantial civil penalties. In addition, our contracts with private insurers often provide such insurers with audit rights over payments made to us and the ability to seek recoupment for overpayments. We believe that audits, inquiries and investigations from government agencies and private insurers will occur from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, which could result in substantial costs to us, legal actions by or against us, and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention. New regulations and heightened enforcement activity also could materially affect our cost of doing business and our risk of becoming the subject of an audit or investigation. We cannot predict whether any future audits, inquiries or investigations, or the public disclosure of such matters, likely would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. See Item 1. Business-\u201cGovernment Investigations.\u201d\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated, and government authorities may determine that we have failed to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations.\nThe healthcare industry and physicians\u2019 medical practices, including the healthcare and other services that we and our affiliated physicians provide, are subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations, compliance with which imposes substantial costs on us. Of particular importance are the provisions summarized as follows:\n\u2022\nfederal laws (including the federal FCA) that prohibit entities and individuals from knowingly and willfully (or with reckless disregard or deliberate ignorance) presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims to Medicare, Medicaid and other government-funded programs, or improperly retaining known overpayments;\n\u2022\nWhen an entity is determined to have violated the federal FCA, it must pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $11,363 and $23,331 for each separate false claim. Suits filed under the federal FCA can be brought directly by the government or be brought by an individual (known as a \u201crelator\u201d or, more commonly, as a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d) on behalf of the government, known as \u201cqui tam\u201d actions. Relators bringing qui tam actions under the federal FCA receive a share of any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. In addition, certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal FCA. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action, even before the validity of the claim is established and even if the government decides not to intervene in the lawsuit. Healthcare entities may decide to agree to large settlements with the government and/or whistleblowers to avoid the cost and negative publicity associated with litigation.\n\u2022\nThe ACA amended federal law to provide that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil FCA. Criminal prosecution is possible for knowingly making or presenting a false or fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government.\n\u2022\na provision of the Social Security Act, commonly referred to as the federal \u201canti-kickback\u201d statute, that prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any remuneration, including a bribe, kickback, rebate, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in return for the referral, arrangement for, or recommendation of patients for, or for the purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for, items and services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, by federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nThe definition of \u201cremuneration\u201d has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including such items as gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, waiver of payments, and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Due to the broad sweep of the federal anti-kickback statute, Congress established certain exceptions to the definition of remuneration under the statute and also authorized the HHS Office of the Inspector General to issue regulations, commonly known as safe harbors, that remove certain arrangements from the definition of remuneration under the statute, provided that the arrangement satisfies, in their entirety, the provisions of the particular exception or safe harbor. Meeting a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor under the federal anti-kickback statute will assure parties to the arrangement that they will not be prosecuted under the federal anti-kickback statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more safe harbors does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued. However, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor element may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities or invite litigation by private citizens under state or federal false claims statutes.\n\u2022\nOur relationships with referral sources, including GHC Program patients, are subject to scrutiny under the federal anti-kickback statute and must be structured in a manner to promote compliance.\n\u2022\nThe penalties for violating the federal anti-kickback statute include imprisonment for up to ten years, fines of up to $100,000 per violation and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many states have adopted prohibitions similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items and services reimbursed by any source, not only by the government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n\u2022\na provision of the Social Security Act, the federal Physician Self-Referral Law, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, that, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits physicians from making a referral to an entity for certain \u201cdesignated health services\u201d or \u201cDHS\u201d payable by Medicare if the physician, or an immediate family member of the physician, has a direct or indirect financial relationship (including ownership interests and compensation arrangements) with the entity. The Stark Law also prohibits such an entity from presenting or causing to be presented a claim to Medicare for DHS provided pursuant to a prohibited referral, and provides that certain collections related to any such claims must be refunded in a timely manner. Although the Stark Law is drafted to apply only to Medicare claims, the DOJ has taken the position that it applies to Medicaid claims under an extension of the federal FCA and several courts, including courts in Florida and Texas, have agreed.\n\u2022\nThe Stark Law is a strict liability statute and therefore, any referrals for Medicare DHS pursuant to a financial relationship that does not meet an exception will be nonpayable and subject to refund to Medicare. In addition, any Medicare \u201coverpayment\u201d (that is, Medicare funds to which a person is not entitled) must be returned within 60 days of identification-or risk liability under the FCA\u2019s \u201cobligation\u201d provision. Therefore, claims relating to Stark Law violations must be timely refunded to Medicare or we would risk liability under the federal FCA.\n\u2022\nAll of our relationships with referring physicians will implicate the Stark Law, including our ownership, physician employment, independent contractor physicians, lease arrangements with physicians, nonmonetary compensation to physicians, and our relationships with hospitals and other entities. Each such financial relationship must satisfy a Stark Law exception.\n\u2022\nBecause our practices provide DHS within the practice (e.g., outpatient drugs, laboratory services, etc.), an exception to the Stark Law must be met with respect to those referrals. Generally, the In-Office\nAncillary Services (\u201cIOAS\u201d) Exception is utilized for referrals of DHS made within a physician\u2019s group practice. Alternatively, the Physician Services Exception could also be used to shield referrals of physician services within a physician group. In order to utilize both the IOAS Exception and the Physician Services Exception, the group must, among other things, satisfy the\nStark Law\u2019s definition of a \u201cgroup practice.\u201d The group practice definition also encompasses how a physician practice may compensate its physician shareholders, employees, and independent contractors. For example, group practices are not permitted to distribute profits derived from DHS based directly on the volume or value of referrals. However, there are a number of ways that a group practice can distribute profits, including DHS profits, to its physicians, based indirectly upon referrals, without running afoul of the Stark Law. Our ancillary services revenues must be allocated in a compliant manner to avoid falling outside of the Group Practice definition, which would result in all of our Medicare (and potentially, Medicaid) DHS referral revenues becoming nonpayable and subject to refund.\n\u2022\nViolations of the Stark Law result in civil penalties and program exclusions for knowing violations, civil assessment of up to three times the amount claimed.\n\u2022\nAnother federal law, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law (\u201cCMPL\u201d) provides for additional civil monetary penalties against an entity that engages in prohibited activities including but not limited to violations of the Stark or Anti-Kickback laws, knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim, employment of an excluded individual and the provision or offer of anything of value to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the transferring party knows or should know is likely to influence beneficiary selection of a particular provider for which payment may be made in whole or in part by Medicare or Medicaid;\n\u2022\n\u201cRemuneration\u201d is defined under the CMPL as any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value. There are certain exceptions to the definition of remuneration for offerings that meet the Financial Need, Preventative Care, or Promoting Access to Care exceptions. Sanctions for violations of the CMPL include civil monetary penalties and administrative penalties up to and including exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.\n\u2022\nsimilar state law provisions pertaining to anti-kickback, fee splitting, self-referral and false claims, and other fraud and abuse issues which typically are not limited to relationships involving government-funded programs. In some cases these laws prohibit or regulate additional conduct beyond what federal law affects, including applicability to items and services paid by commercial insurers and private pay patients. Penalties for violating these laws can range from fines to criminal sanctions;\n\u2022\nprovisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1347 that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or artifice to defraud a healthcare benefit program or falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any material false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;\n\u2022\nfederal and state regulations that broadly define provider and supplier affiliation and require providers to disclose to GHC Programs certain disclosable events including, without limitation, current or previous direct or indirect affiliations with providers or suppliers having uncollected debt to GHC Programs, being subject to payment suspension, being excluded from participation in GHC Programs or had such billing privileges denied or revoked, and that permit GHC Programs to deny or revoke provider or supplier enrollment based upon such affiliations upon determining that the affiliations pose an undue risk of fraud, waste, or abuse;\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws related to confidentiality, privacy and security of personal information such as HIPAA, including medical information and records, that limit the manner in which we may use and disclose that information, impose obligations to safeguard that information and require that we notify third parties in the event of a breach;\n\u2022\nHIPAA violations can result in both civil monetary penalties and criminal sanctions. HIPAA has ranges of increasing minimum penalty amounts tiered according to the entity\u2019s degree of culpability, with a maximum penalty of $1,500,000 for all violations of an identical provision within a year. Further, HHS has obtained increasingly high dollar settlements from covered entities relating to HIPAA violations over the past several years.\n\u2022\nUnsecured Breaches of PHI may also result in unexpected costs in the millions of dollars to us through third party litigation, contractual breaches, and breach notification and remediation. In addition, we may experience reputational harms and a negative market perception when it comes to protecting patient data that could influence our future operations.\n\u2022\nstate laws that prohibit general business corporations from practicing medicine, controlling physicians\u2019 medical decisions or engaging in certain practices, such as splitting fees with physicians;\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws governing participation in GHC Programs could result in denial of our application to become a participating provider or revocation of our participation or billing privileges, which in turn, could cause us to not be able to treat patients covered by the applicable program or prohibit us from billing for the treatment services provided to such patients;\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws that prohibit providers from billing and receiving payment from Medicare and Medicaid for services unless the services are medically necessary, adequately and accurately documented and billed using codes that accurately reflect the services rendered;\n\u2022\nfederal and state laws pertaining to the provision and coverage of services by non-physician\npractitioners, such as advanced nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other clinical professionals, physician supervision of such services and reimbursement requirements that may be dependent on the manner in which the services are provided and documented; and\n\u2022\nfederal laws that impose civil administrative sanctions for, among other violations, inappropriate billing of services to federal healthcare programs, inappropriately reducing hospital inpatient lengths of stay for such patients or employing individuals who are excluded from participation in federally funded healthcare programs.\nIn addition, we believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation, the scope and effect of which we cannot predict. See Item 1. Business-\u201cGovernment Regulation.\u201d\nWe may in the future become the subject of regulatory or other investigations, audits or proceedings, and our interpretations of applicable laws, rules and regulations may be challenged. For example, regulatory authorities or other parties may assert that our arrangements with our affiliated professional entities constitute fee splitting or the corporate practice of medicine and seek to invalidate these arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. See Item 1. Business-\u201cGovernment Regulation-Fee Splitting; Corporate Practice of Medicine.\u201d Regulatory authorities or other parties also could assert that our relationships, including fee arrangements, among our affiliated professional contractors, hospital clients or referring physicians violate the anti-kickback, fee splitting or self-referral laws and regulations or that we have submitted false claims or otherwise failed to comply with government program reimbursement requirements. See Item 1. Business-\u201cGovernment Regulation-Fraud and Abuse Provisions\u201d and \u201c-Government Regulatory Requirements.\u201d Such investigations, proceedings and challenges could result in substantial defense costs to us and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention. In addition, violations of these laws are punishable by monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from participation in GHC Programs, and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such laws and regulations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. Additionally, federal and state fraud and abuse laws, rules and regulations are not static and amendments, clarifications, revisions, or other modifications to these laws may occur from time to time. For instance, on December 2, 2020, both CMS and the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d) issued Final Rules revising the federal anti-kickback statute, the CMPL, and the Stark Law regulations to foster arrangements that would promote care coordination, advance the delivery of value-based care, and protect consumers from harms caused by fraud and abuse through additional new statutory definitions, safe harbors, and exceptions. Both current and future arrangements may be eligible for additional protections under new exceptions and safe harbors and certain arrangements may need to be reconsidered in light of changes made to existing exceptions, safe\nharbors, and agency definitions. Compliance with federal fraud and abuse laws such as the anti-kickback statute, the CMPL, and the Stark Law involves constant monitoring for regulatory changes, agency and court interpretations, and revisiting of arrangements based on new interpretations or clarifications, all of which will require ongoing compliance costs. In addition, these laws and their exceptions and safe harbors are complex and clear interpretations are not always available. Despite our efforts to comply, we cannot guarantee that a government agency will necessarily agree with our interpretations or that one or more of our arrangements will not be subject to challenge, nor can we provide any assurance that they will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.\nGovernment authorities or other parties may assert that our business practices violate antitrust laws.\nThe healthcare industry is subject to close antitrust scrutiny. The FTC, the Antitrust Division of the DOJ and state Attorneys General all actively review and, in some cases, take enforcement action against business conduct and acquisitions in the healthcare industry. Private parties harmed by alleged anticompetitive conduct can also bring antitrust suits. Violations of antitrust laws may be punishable by substantial penalties, including significant monetary fines and treble damages, civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and consent decrees and injunctions prohibiting certain activities or requiring divestiture or discontinuance of business operations. Any of these penalties could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.\nOur affiliated physicians and other individual providers may not satisfy all conditions of payment or otherwise appropriately record or document services that they provide.\nOur affiliated physicians and other individual providers are responsible for maintaining all required professional licensures or certifications in good standing, which is generally a condition of reimbursement in GHC Programs, and for appropriately recording and documenting the services that they provide. We use this information to seek reimbursement for their services from third-party payors. In addition, we utilize third-party contractors to perform certain revenue cycle management functions for healthcare providers, including medical coding. If our affiliated physicians or other individual providers and third-party contractors do not appropriately document, or where applicable, code for their services or our customers\u2019 services, we could be subjected to administrative, regulatory, civil, or criminal investigations or sanctions and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. We are further obligated under the federal FCA to timely report and return any identified overpayments and to maintain reasonable internal audit mechanisms to identify overpayments. Failure to timely report and return overpayments to Medicare or Medicaid could subject us to liability under the federal FCA, and also equivalent false claims acts on the state level.\nRisks Related to Our Business Strategy\nWe may not find suitable acquisition candidates or successfully integrate our acquisitions. Our acquisitions may expose us to greater business risks and could affect our payor mix.\nWe have expanded and continue to seek to expand our presence in new and existing metropolitan areas by acquiring established physician group practices. Also, both independently and in collaboration with our hospital partners, we may seek to expand into new specialties and subspecialties. In addition, we have acquired physician and other healthcare services companies that are complementary to our physician practices.\nOur acquisition strategy involves numerous risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or strategic opportunities or implement successfully or realize the expected benefits of any suitable opportunities. In addition, we compete for acquisitions with other potential acquirers, some of which may have greater financial or operational resources than we do. This competition may intensify due to the ongoing consolidation in the healthcare industry, which may increase our acquisition costs.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to complete acquisitions of physician practices or services companies or we may complete acquisitions on less favorable terms as a result of changes in tax laws, healthcare fraud and abuse laws, financial market or other economic or market conditions.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate completed acquisitions, including our recent acquisitions. Integrating completed acquisitions into our existing operations involves numerous short-term and long-term risks, including diversion of our management\u2019s attention, failure to retain key personnel, long-term value of acquired intangible assets and acquisition expenses. In addition, we may be required to comply with laws, rules and regulations that may differ not only from those of the states in which our operations are currently conducted but from an expansion in the service offerings we provide in certain states for which the laws, rules and regulations may be different.\n\u2022\nWe cannot be certain that any acquired business will continue to maintain its pre-acquisition\nrevenue and growth rates or be financially successful. In addition, we cannot be certain of the extent of any unknown or contingent liabilities of any acquired business, including liabilities for failure to comply with applicable laws, or liabilities relating to medical malpractice claims. Generally, we obtain indemnification agreements from the sellers of businesses acquired with respect to pre-closing\nacts, omissions and other similar risks. It is possible that we may seek to enforce indemnification provisions in the future against sellers who may no longer have the financial wherewithal to satisfy their obligations to us. Accordingly, we may incur material liabilities for past activities of acquired businesses.\n\u2022\nWe could incur or assume indebtedness and issue equity in connection with acquisitions. The issuance of shares of our common stock for an acquisition may result in dilution to our existing shareholders and, depending on the number of shares that we issue, the resale of such shares could affect the trading price of our common stock.\n\u2022\nWe may acquire businesses that derive a greater portion of their revenue from GHC Programs than what we recognize on a consolidated basis or that have business models with lower operating margins than ours. These acquisitions could affect our overall payor mix or operating results in future periods.\n\u2022\nAcquisitions of practices and services companies could entail financial and operating risks not fully anticipated. Such acquisitions could divert management\u2019s attention and our resources.\n\u2022\nAn acquisition could be subject to a challenge under the antitrust laws either before or after it is consummated. Such a challenge could involve substantial legal costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources and could result in us having to abandon the transaction or make a divestiture.\nIf we are not successful in integrating an acquisition, we may decide to dispose of such acquisition and may do so at a loss or record impairments in connection with such a disposition, such as in our disposition of our anesthesiology and radiology medical groups in 2020.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our same-unit and organic growth strategies.\nIn addition to our acquisition growth strategy, we seek opportunities for increasing revenue from our existing operations through same-unit and organic growth strategies. We also seek opportunities to grow organically outside of our existing operations. We may not be able to successfully execute our same-unit and organic growth strategies for reasons including the following:\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to expand the services that our affiliated physicians provide to our hospital partners or the services provided by our services companies to their customers.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to attract referrals to our office-based practices or neonatology transports to our hospital-based units.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to execute new contractual arrangements with hospitals, including through joint ventures, where we either currently provide or do not currently provide physician services.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to work with our hospital partners to develop integrated services programs for which we become a multi-specialty provider of solutions within the maternal-fetal, newborn, pediatric continuum of care.\n\u2022\nWe may not accurately project same-unit and organic growth performance, or we may experience a shift in the mix of services that certain of our customers request from us, potentially resulting in lower margins.\nIn addition, certain of our organic growth strategies may involve risks and uncertainties similar to those for our acquisition strategy. See \u201cWe may not find suitable acquisition candidates or successfully integrate our acquisitions. Our acquisitions may expose us to greater business risks and could affect our payor mix.\u201d\nWe may not effectively manage our growth.\nWe have historically experienced significant growth in our business, including growth outside of our core physician specialties. Growth in the number of our employees and affiliated physicians has in the past placed significant demands on our financial, operational and management resources. Significant growth may impair our ability to provide our services efficiently and to manage our employees adequately. While we are taking steps to manage our growth, our future results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to do so effectively.\nFailure to manage third-party service providers may adversely affect our ability to maintain the quality of service that we provide.\nWe outsource a certain portion of our revenue cycle management functions to third-party service providers, but we may increase the amount of revenue cycle management functions we outsource in the future. These functions are performed both domestically and in offshore locations, with our oversight. If our outsourcing partners fail to perform their obligations in a timely manner at satisfactory quality levels, in compliance with regulatory requirements, or if they are unable to attract or retain sufficient personnel with the necessary skill sets to meet our outsourcing needs, the efficiency, effectiveness and quality of our services could suffer. In addition, our reliance on a workforce in other countries exposes us to disruptions in the business, political and economic environment in those regions. Further, any changes to existing laws or the enactment of new legislation restricting offshore outsourcing in the United States may adversely affect our ability to outsource functions to third-party offshore service providers. Our ability to manage any difficulties encountered could be largely outside of our control. In addition, federal government and third-party payors may have prohibitions or restrictions on the use of third-party service providers outside of the United States and/or require notice for the use of such third-party service providers. Diminished service quality from outsourcing, our inability to utilize offshore service providers or the failure to comply with restrictions on the use of third-party service providers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.\nHospitals or other customers may terminate their agreements with us, our physicians may lose the ability to provide services in hospitals or administrative fees paid to us by hospitals may be reduced.\nOur net revenue is derived primarily from fee-for-service\nbillings for patient care and other services provided by our affiliated physicians and from administrative fees paid to us by hospitals. See Item 1. Business-\u201cRelationships with Our Partners-Hospitals.\u201d Our hospital partners or other customers may cancel or not renew their contracts with us, may reduce or eliminate our administrative fees in the future, or refuse to pay us our administrative fees if we fail to honor the terms of our agreement or fail to meet certain performance metrics under those agreements. Further, consolidation of hospitals, healthcare systems or other customers could adversely affect our ability to negotiate with these entities. Adverse economic conditions, including decreased federal and state funding to hospitals, could influence future actions of our hospital partners or other customers.\nTo the extent that our arrangements with our hospital partners or other customers are canceled, or are not renewed or replaced with other arrangements having at least as favorable terms, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, to the extent our affiliated physicians lose their privileges in hospitals or hospitals enter into arrangements with or employ other physicians, including our existing affiliated physicians, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Operating our Business\nWe are dependent upon our key management personnel for our future success.\nOur success depends to a significant extent on the continued contributions of our key management personnel for the management of our business and implementation of our business strategy. We experienced significant management turnover in 2020 and the further loss of or changes in key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.\nOur quarterly results will likely fluctuate from period to period.\nWe have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience quarterly fluctuations in net revenue and net income. For example, we typically experience negative cash flow from operations in the first quarter of each year, principally as a result of bonus payments to affiliated physicians as well as discretionary matching contributions for participants in our qualified contributory savings plans. In addition, a significant number of our employees and associated professional contractors (primarily affiliated physicians) exceed the level of taxable wages for social security contributions during the first and second quarters. As a result, we incur a significantly higher payroll tax burden and our net income is lower during those quarters. Moreover, a lower number of calendar days are present in the first and second quarters of the year as compared to the remainder of the year. Because we provide services in the NICU on a 24-hours-a-day\nbasis, 365 days a year, any reduction in service days will have a corresponding reduction in net revenue. In addition, any reduction in office days in our office-based practices will also have a corresponding reduction in net revenue. We also have significant fixed operating costs, including costs for our affiliated physicians, and as a result, are highly dependent on patient volume and capacity utilization of our affiliated physicians to sustain profitability. Quarterly results may also be impacted by the timing of acquisitions and any fluctuation in patient volume. As a result, our results of operations for any quarter are not indicative of results of operations for any future period or full fiscal year.\nWe may write-off\nintangible assets, such as goodwill.\nThe carrying value of our intangible assets, which consists primarily of goodwill related to our acquisitions, is subject to testing at least annually, and more frequently if impairment indicators exist. Under current accounting standards, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis and we have been subject to impairment losses as circumstances have changed after acquisition. If we record additional impairment losses related to our goodwill in the future, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.\nWe are subject to medical malpractice and other lawsuits that may not covered by insurance.\nOur business entails an inherent risk of claims of medical malpractice against our affiliated physicians and us. We may also be subject to other lawsuits which may involve large claims and significant defense costs. Although we currently maintain liability insurance coverage intended to cover professional liability and other claims, there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover liabilities arising out of claims asserted against us where the outcomes of such claims are unfavorable to us. Generally, we self-insure our liabilities to pay retention amounts for professional liability matters through a wholly owned captive insurance\nsubsidiary. Liabilities in excess of our insurance coverage, including coverage for professional liability and other claims, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. See Item 1. Business-\u201cOther Legal Proceedings\u201d and- \u201cProfessional and General Liability Coverage.\u201d\nThe reserves that we have established related to our professional liability losses are subject to inherent uncertainties and if actual costs exceed our estimates this may lead to a reduction in our net earnings.\nWe have established reserves for losses and related expenses that represent estimates involving actuarial projections. These actuarial projections are developed at a given point in time and represent our expectations of the ultimate resolution and administration of costs of losses incurred with respect to professional liability risks for the amount of risk retained by us. Insurance reserves are inherently subject to uncertainty. Our reserve estimates are based on actuarial valuations using historical claims, demographic factors, industry trends, severity and exposure factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimates of projected ultimate losses are developed at least annually. Our reserves have been, and could further be, significantly affected should current and future occurrences differ from historical claim trends and expectations. While claims are monitored closely when estimating reserves, the complexity of the claims and wide range of potential outcomes often hamper timely adjustments to the assumptions used in these estimates. Actual losses and related expenses may deviate, perhaps substantially, from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements. If our estimated reserves are determined to be inadequate, we have been and could further be required to increase reserves at the time the deficiency is determined. See Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-\u201cApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Professional Liability Coverage.\u201d\nWe are subject to litigation risks.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in various litigation matters and claims, including regulatory proceedings, administrative proceedings, governmental investigations, and contract disputes, as they relate to our services and business. We may face potential claims or liability for, among other things, breach of contract, defamation, libel, fraud, negligence or data breaches. Our contracts with hospitals generally require us to indemnify them and their affiliates for losses resulting from the negligence of our affiliated physicians and other clinicians. We may also face employment-related litigation, including claims of age discrimination, sexual harassment, gender discrimination, immigration violations, or other local, state, and federal labor law violations. Because of the uncertain nature of litigation and insurance coverage decisions, the outcome of such actions and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of them could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. In addition, legal fees and costs associated with prosecuting and defending litigation matters could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and the trading price of our securities.\nWe may not be able to collect reimbursements for our services from third-party payors.\nA significant portion of our net revenue is derived from reimbursements from various third-party payors, including GHC Programs, private insurance plans and managed care plans, for services provided by our affiliated professional contractors. We are responsible for submitting reimbursement requests to these payors and collecting the reimbursements, and we assume the financial risks relating to uncollectible and delayed reimbursements. In the current healthcare environment, payors continue efforts to control expenditures for healthcare, including revisions to coverage and reimbursement policies. Due to the nature of our business and our participation in government-funded and private reimbursement programs, we are involved from time to time in inquiries, reviews, audits and investigations by governmental agencies and private payors of our business practices, including assessments of our compliance with coding, billing and documentation requirements. We may be required to repay these agencies or private payors if a finding is made that we were incorrectly reimbursed within a certain time period (60 days for government payors), or we may become involved in\ndisputes with payors and could be subjected to pre-payment\nand post-payment reviews, which can be time-consuming and result in non-payment\nor delayed payment for the services we provide. We may also experience difficulties in collecting reimbursements because third-party payors may seek to reduce or delay reimbursements to which we are entitled for services that our affiliated physicians have provided, they experience administrative issues that result in a delay in reimbursements, or pursuant to binding arbitration proceedings for out-of-network\nitems or services. In addition, GHC Programs may deny or revoke our application to become a participating provider if we do not disclose certain events relating to our affiliates or for other reasons that could cause us to not be able to provide services to patients or prohibit us from billing for such services. If we are not reimbursed fully or in a timely manner for such services or there is a finding that we were incorrectly reimbursed, our revenue, cash flows and financial condition could be materially, adversely affected. In addition, we may choose to challenge certain GHC reimbursement decisions through administrative appeal mechanisms. Currently, many of those appeal pathways are backlogged and slow to provide resolution, further affecting our ability to collect reimbursement for services rendered.\nIn addition, adverse economic conditions could affect the timeliness and amounts received from our third-party and government payors which would impact our short-term liquidity needs.\nRisks Related to our Capital Structure\nOur current indebtedness and any future indebtedness could adversely affect us by reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of any variable rate debt. In addition, a certain portion of our interest expense may not be deductible.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our total indebtedness was $1.75 billion, all of which was at fixed interest rates, of which $0.75 billion was repaid in January 2021. We also had $900.0 million of additional borrowing capacity under our revolving line of credit which was subject to a variable interest rate. Other debt we incur also could be variable rate debt. In addition, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 places certain limitations on the deductibility of interest expense at a percentage of taxable income. If interest rates increase, any variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, and if interest expense increases beyond a specified percentage of taxable income, a portion of that interest expense may not be deductible for income tax purposes, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have limited restrictions on incurring substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Our current indebtedness and any future increases in leverage could have adverse consequences on us, including:\n\u2022\na substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be required to service interest and principal payments on our debt and will not be available for operations, working capital, capital expenditures, expansion, acquisitions, dividends or general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain additional financing in the future may be impaired;\n\u2022\nwe may be more highly leveraged than our competitors, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u2022\nour flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry may be limited; and\n\u2022\nwe may be more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business, our industry or the economy in general.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, business, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our revolving line of credit in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs.\nAny failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in other defaults, disrupt our operations and cause a reduction of our credit rating, which could further harm our ability to finance or refinance our obligations and business operations.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service requirements, we may be forced to reduce or delay acquisitions or other investments, or to seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our debt, including our revolving line of credit and senior notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nProvisions of our articles and bylaws could deter takeover attempts, but our business could be negatively affected as a result of shareholder activism.\nOur Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, authorize our Board of Directors to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock and to determine the powers, preferences and rights of these shares without shareholder approval. This preferred stock could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to those of the holders of common stock. The issuance of preferred stock under some circumstances could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control. In addition, provisions in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, and Bylaws, including those relating to calling shareholder meetings, taking action by written consent and other matters, could render it more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of Mednax through a proxy contest or consent solicitation, however, there is no assurance that these provisions would have such an effect. These provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for our shares of common stock. Notwithstanding these provisions, we could, and have, become the target of activist shareholders who acquire ownership positions in our common stock and seek to influence our company. Responding to actions by activist shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our business and divert the attention of our Board of Directors, management and employees. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, including the composition of our Board of Directors, as a result of shareholder activism may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or other instability, which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers and acquisition candidates, and make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and the trading prices of our securities. In addition, the trading prices of our securities may experience periods of increased volatility as a result of shareholder activism.\nRisks Related to Labor\nWe may not be able to successfully recruit, onboard and retain qualified physicians and other clinicians and other personnel, and our compensation expense for existing clinicians and other personnel may increase.\nWe are dependent upon our ability to recruit and retain a sufficient number of qualified physicians and other clinicians and other personnel to service existing units at hospitals and our affiliated practices and expand our business. We compete with many types of healthcare providers, including teaching, research and government institutions, hospitals and health systems and other practice and services groups, for the services of qualified clinicians. We may not be able to continue to recruit new clinicians or other personnel or renew contracts with existing clinicians or other personnel on acceptable terms. We have and may seek to renew clinician contracts prior to their existing renewal date for various reasons, including to move clinicians to a different compensation structure. We may not be successful in these early renewal efforts, and further, clinical compensation may increase as a result of incremental compensation incentives that may be required by clinicians to agree to the change in compensation structure. In addition, the recruiting and onboarding process for certain of our physicians and other clinicians can take several months, or longer, to complete due to various requirements, including state\nlicensing and hospital credentialing. In addition, if the demand exceeds the supply for physicians and other clinicians and personnel either in general or in specific markets, we could experience an increase in compensation expense, including premium pay and agency labor costs. If we are unable to recruit new physicians, renew contracts on acceptable terms or onboard physicians, clinicians and other personnel in a reasonable period of time, our ability to service existing or new hospital units and staff existing or new office-based practices could be adversely affected. In addition, if we experience a higher rate of growth in compensation expense, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities could be adversely affected.\nA significant number of our affiliated physicians or other clinicians could leave our affiliated practices or our affiliated professional contractors may be unable to enforce the non-competition\ncovenants of departed physicians.\nOur affiliated professional contractors usually enter into employment agreements with our affiliated physicians. Certain of our employment agreements can be terminated without cause by any party upon prior written notice. In addition, substantially all of our affiliated physicians have agreed not to compete within a specified geographic area for a certain period after termination of employment. The law governing non-compete\nagreements and other forms of restrictive covenants varies from state to state. Although we believe that the non-competition\nand other restrictive covenants applicable to our affiliated physicians are reasonable in scope and duration and therefore enforceable under applicable state law, courts and arbitrators in some states may be reluctant to enforce non-compete\nagreements and restrictive covenants against physicians. In addition, we have and may incur significant legal fees to pursue enforcement of such agreements and restrictive covenants. Our affiliated physicians or other clinicians may leave our affiliated practices for a variety of reasons, including in order to provide services for other types of healthcare providers, such as teaching, research and government institutions, hospitals and health systems and other practice groups. If a substantial number of our affiliated physicians or other clinicians leave our affiliated practices, we could incur significant legal fees to pursue enforcement of certain covenants within employment agreements or if our affiliated professional contractors are unable to enforce the non-competition\ncovenants in the employment agreements, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nInformation Systems, Cybersecurity and Data Privacy Risks\nWe may not be able to maintain effective and efficient information systems or properly safeguard our information systems.\nOur operations are dependent on uninterrupted performance of our information systems. Failure to maintain reliable information systems, disruptions in our existing information systems or the implementation of new systems could cause disruptions in our business operations, including errors and delays in billings and collections, difficulty satisfying requirements under hospital contracts, disputes with patients and payors, violations of patient privacy and confidentiality requirements and other regulatory requirements, increased administrative expenses and other adverse consequences.\nIn addition, information security risks have generally increased in recent years, and in particular during COVID-19\nbecause of new technologies and the increased activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks resulting in the theft of protected health, business or financial information. Despite our layered security controls, experienced computer programmers and hackers have been and may be able to penetrate our information systems and may have and may be able to misappropriate or compromise sensitive patient or personnel information or proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. They also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that disable our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. Outside parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees to take actions, including the release of confidential or sensitive information or to make fraudulent payments, through illegal electronic spamming, phishing or other tactics.\nA failure in or breach of our information systems as a result of cyber-attacks or other tactics could disrupt our business, has and may result in the release or misuse of PHI, confidential or proprietary business information, and has or may cause financial loss, damage our reputation, increase our administrative expenses, and expose us to additional risk of liability to federal or state governments or individuals. Although we believe that we have reasonable and appropriate information security procedures and other safeguards in place, which are monitored and routinely tested internally and by external parties, as cyber threats continue to evolve, we have been and may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers and disruption of our operations, including, without limitation, our billing processes. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of patient healthcare and other sensitive information, proprietary or confidential information about us, our patients, clients or customers, or other third-parties, could expose such persons\u2019 personal information to the risk of financial or medical identity theft or expose us or such persons to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, have resulted in litigation and potential liability for us, and could damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. Additionally, under certain circumstances, we could be excluded temporarily or permanently from certain commercial or GHC Programs. Any of these disruptions or breaches of security could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.\nWe may experience difficulties implementing new technology, software and processes.\nWe are engaged in various implementation efforts for new technology, software and processes, including cloud-based solutions for an enterprise resource planning system (\u201cERP\u201d) and telehealth support, among others. These solutions are designed to provide greater efficiency and flexibility across our enterprise. The ERP cloud-based solution implementation will require significant investments of human and financial resources. In implementing this and other solutions, we may experience significant delays, increased costs and other difficulties. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of these solutions could adversely affect our ability to operate our business. While we have invested significant resources in planning and project management, unforeseen implementation issues may arise. In addition, our efforts to centralize various business processes and functions within our organization in connection with our system implementations may disrupt our operations. Any implementation issues or business operation disruptions could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, internal controls over financial reporting and the trading price of our securities.\nHospitals could limit our ability to use our management information systems in our units by requiring us to use their own management information systems.\nOur management information systems are used to support our day-to-day\noperations and ongoing clinical research and business analysis. If a hospital prohibits us from using our own management information systems, it may interrupt the efficient operation of our information systems which, in turn, may limit our ability to operate important aspects of our business, including billing and reimbursement as well as research and education initiatives. This inability to use our management information systems at hospital locations may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFederal and state laws that protect the privacy and security of personal information may increase our costs and limit our ability to collect and use that information and subject us to liability if we are unable to fully comply with such laws.\nNumerous federal and state laws, rules and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, security and confidentiality of personal information, including individually identifiable health information. These laws include:\n\u2022\nProvisions of HIPAA that limit how covered entities and business associates may use and disclose PHI, provide certain rights to individuals with respect to that information and impose certain security requirements;\n\u2022\nHITECH, which required the OCR to strengthen and expand the HIPAA Privacy Rule and Security Rule and imposes data breach notification obligations;\n\u2022\nOther federal and state laws restricting the use and protecting the privacy and security of personal information, including health information, many of which are not preempted by HIPAA, and certain states have proposed or enacted legislation that will create new data privacy and security obligations for certain entities, such as the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act;\n\u2022\nFederal and state consumer protection laws, including the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s authority under Section 5; and\n\u2022\nFederal and state laws regulating the conduct of research with human subjects.\nAs part of our business operations, including our medical record keeping, third-party billing, research and other services, we collect and maintain PHI in paper and electronic format. Standards related to health information, whether implemented pursuant to HIPAA, HITECH, state laws, federal or state action or otherwise, could have a significant effect on the manner in which we handle personal information, including PHI, and communicate with payors, providers, patients and others, and compliance with these standards could impose significant costs on us or limit our ability to offer services, thereby negatively impacting the business opportunities available to us.\nIn addition to the laws above, we may see more stringent state and federal privacy legislation in 2021 and beyond, including potential changes to HIPAA or the enactment of a federal privacy law, as the increased cyber-attacks during COVID-19\nhave once again put a spotlight on data privacy and security in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. We cannot predict where new legislation might arise, the scope of such legislation, or the potential impact to our business and operations.\nIf we are alleged to not comply with existing or new laws, rules and regulations related to PHI or other personal information we could be subject to litigation and to sanctions that include monetary fines, civil or administrative penalties, civil damage awards or criminal penalties.\nRisks Related to Competition and Consolidation\nOur industry is highly competitive.\nThe healthcare industry is highly competitive and subject to continual changes in the methods by which services are provided and the manner in which healthcare providers are selected and compensated. Because our operations consist primarily of physician services provided within hospital-based units, we compete with other healthcare services companies and physician groups for contracts with hospitals to provide our services to patients. We also face competition from hospitals themselves to provide our services.\nFurther, consolidation within the healthcare industry could strengthen certain competitors that provide services to hospitals and other customers. Companies in other healthcare industry segments, some of which have\ngreater financial and other resources than ours, may become competitors in providing neonatal, maternal-fetal or other pediatric subspecialty care. Additionally, we face competition from healthcare-focused and other private equity firms. We may not be able to continue to compete effectively in this industry, additional competitors may enter metropolitan areas where we operate, and this increased competition may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.", "PERMNO": 82272, "SIC": 8011, "TIC": "MD"}
