The risks set forth below could materially affect our business, financial condition and future results and are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nRisks related to our business\nThe loss of, or damage to, a data center or any other failure or interruption to our system architecture and / or network infrastructure could materially harm our revenue and impair our ability to conduct our operations.\nBecause virtually all of the services we provide require our clients to query a copy of our continuously updated databases and directories to obtain necessary routing, operational and marketing data, the integrity of our data centers, including network elements managed by third parties throughout the world, and the systems through which we deliver our services are essential to our business. Notably, certain of our data centers and related systems are essential to the orderly operation of the U.S. telecommunications system because they enable carriers to ensure that telephone calls are routed to the appropriate destinations.\nOur system architecture is integral to our ability to process a high volume of transactions in a timely and effective manner. Moreover, both we and our clients rely on hardware, software and other computer technology and equipment developed, supported and maintained by third-party providers. We could experience failures or interruptions of our systems and services, or other problems in connection with our operations, as a result of, for example:\n\u2022\ndamage to, or failure of, our computer software or hardware or our connections to, and outsourced service arrangements with, third parties;\n\u2022\nfailure of, or defects in, the third-party systems, software or equipment on which we or our clients rely to access our data centers and other systems;\n\u2022\nerrors in the processing of data by our systems;\n\u2022\ncomputer viruses, malware or software defects;\n\u2022\nphysical or electronic break-ins, sabotage, distributed denial of service, or DDoS, penetration attacks, intentional acts of vandalism and similar events;\n\u2022\nincreased capacity demands or changes in systems requirements of our clients;\n\u2022\nvirtual hijacking of traffic destined to our systems; and\n\u2022\npower loss, communications failures, pandemics, wars, acts of terrorism, political unrest or other man-made or natural disasters.\nWe may not have sufficient redundant systems or back-up facilities to allow us to receive and process data if one or more of the foregoing events occurs. Further, increases in the scope of services that we provide increase the complexity of our network infrastructure. As the scope of services we provide expands or changes in the future, we may be required to make significant expenditures to establish new data centers and acquire additional network capacity from which we may provide services. Moreover, as we add clients, expand our service offerings and increase our visibility in the market we may become a more likely target of attacks similar to those listed in the bullets above. The number of electronic attacks and viruses grows significantly every year, as does the sophistication of these attacks. For example, undetected attackers may be able to monitor unencrypted Internet traffic anywhere in the world and modify it before it reaches our destination, and these attackers may harm our clients by stealing personal or proprietary information, Internet email or IP addresses. If we are not able to react to threats quickly and effectively and stop attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities or circumventing our security measures, the integrity of our systems and networks, and those of our clients and trading partners, may be adversely affected. If we cannot adequately secure and protect the ability of our data centers, offices, networks and related systems to perform consistently at a high level and without interruptions, or if we otherwise fail to meet our clients\u2019 expectations:\n\u2022\nour reputation may be damaged, which may adversely affect our ability to market our services and attract or retain clients;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to significant penalties or damages claims, under our contracts or otherwise, including the requirement to pay substantial penalties related to service level requirements in our contracts;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to make significant expenditures to repair or replace equipment, third-party systems or an entire data center, to establish new data centers and systems from which we may provide services or to take other required corrective action; or\n\u2022\none or more of our significant contracts may be terminated early, or may not be renewed.\nAny of these consequences would adversely affect our revenue, performance and business prospects.\nThe revenue we receive under our seven contracts with North American Portability Management LLC represents, in the aggregate, a substantial portion of our overall revenue. These contracts are not exclusive and could be terminated or modified in ways unfavorable to us. These contracts are due to expire in June 2015 and are currently subject to a competitive proposal process. If we are not selected to continue to provide these services, or if these contracts are terminated or modified in a manner that is adverse to us, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nWe provide NPAC Services pursuant to seven separate contracts with North American Portability Management LLC, or NAPM, an industry group that represents all carriers in the United States. These seven contracts, each of which represented between 4.9% and 9.2% of our total revenue in 2014, in the aggregate represented approximately 48% of our total revenue in 2014. These contracts are not exclusive and NAPM could, at any time, solicit or receive proposals from other providers to provide services that are the same as or similar to ours. The contracts could be terminated or modified in ways unfavorable to us. These contracts are currently scheduled to expire on June 30, 2015.\nNAPM has initiated a process to select the next LNPA following the expiration of the current contracts. NAPM posted a Request for Proposal on February 5, 2013 and we submitted a proposal on April 5, 2013, which we revised on September 18, 2013. On October 21, 2013, we requested the opportunity for all bidders in the selection process to submit additional revised proposals. Together with that request, we also submitted a sealed revised proposal. On January 24, 2014, NAPM notified us that our October 21, 2013 proposal would not be considered.\nOn June 9, 2014, the Wireline Competition Bureau of the FCC issued a public notice seeking comment on the NANC's recommendation to select Telcordia Technologies, Inc., d/b/a iconectiv, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Swedish telecommunications equipment manufacturer, Ericsson, as the sole vendor to serve as the next LNPA. Ultimately, the FCC will rule on the NANC\u2019s recommendation. We continue to compete vigorously in the selection process and maintain the positions that we have set forth in our FCC filings. We disagree with the NANC recommendation of Telcordia and will oppose its adoption by the FCC. The FCC may elect not to take action favorable to us in response to our filings. And, ultimately, we may not be selected by the FCC to serve as the LNPA. Additionally, delays in the final outcome of the competitive proposal process could negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nIf these contracts are terminated, expire without renewal, or are modified in a manner that is adverse to us, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to replace the revenue we will lose if we are not selected to continue to provide these services, or if we are selected to continue to provide these services under terms and conditions that are materially less favorable to us than the current terms and conditions.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, expenses in connection with our participation in the selection process and our pursuit of FCC action to address concerns arising from this process. These efforts may be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations.\nWe are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information.\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive, proprietary and other types of information relating to our products and services and confidential and sensitive information about our clients and others. We expend significant resources on security measures to protect our data and infrastructure against security breaches and cyber attacks and use a complex system of internal processes and software controls along with policies, procedures and training to protect the confidentiality of client data and sensitive information. The cyber risks we face range from cyber attacks common to most industries, to more advanced threats that target us due to our sales of security-related solutions. Breaches of our technology and systems or those of our third party service providers and vendors, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial of service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, computer viruses or malware, technical malfunction, employee error, malfeasance, physical breaches, system disruptions or other actions could cause material interruptions or malfunctions of our products and services or those of third party service providers and may compromise the confidentiality and\nintegrity of confidential or sensitive information regarding our business or clients. Any material incidents or even a perceived breach of our security measures could cause us to experience reputational harm, loss of clients, regulatory actions, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation, liability for failure to safeguard our clients\u2019 information or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance we maintain. As a global company, we could also be impacted by existing and proposed U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection. Any of the foregoing could materially impact our business, operating results or financial condition.\nA significant decline in the volume of transactions we handle could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nUnder our contracts with NAPM, we earn revenue for NPAC Services on an annual, fixed-fee basis. However, in the event that the volume of transactions in a given year is above or below the contractually established volume range for that year, the fixed-fee may be adjusted up or down, respectively, with any such adjustment being applied to the following year\u2019s invoices. In addition, under our contract with the Canadian LNP Consortium Inc., we earn revenue on a per transaction basis. As a result, if industry participants in the United States reduce their usage of our services in a particular year to levels below the established volume range for that year or if industry participants in Canada reduce their usage of our services from their current levels, our revenue and results of operations may suffer. For example, consolidation in the industry could result in a decline in transactions if the remaining carriers decide to handle changes to their networks internally rather than use the services that we provide. Moreover, if customer turnover among carriers in the industry stabilizes or declines, or if carriers do not compete vigorously to lure customers away from their competitors, use of our telephone number portability and other services may decline. If carriers develop internal systems to address their infrastructure needs, or if the cost of such transactions makes it impractical for a given carrier to use our services for these purposes, we may experience a reduction in transaction volumes. Carriers might be able to charge consumers directly for our services, which could also have an adverse impact on transaction volumes. Finally, the trends that we believe will drive the future demand for our services, such as the emergence of IP services, growth of wireless services, consolidation in the industry, and pressure on carriers to reduce costs, may not actually result in increased demand for our existing services or for the ancillary directory services that we expect to offer, which would harm our future revenue and growth prospects.\nCertain of our client contracts may be terminated or modified at any time prior to their completion, which could lead to an unexpected loss of revenue, adversely affect our operating performance and damage our reputation.\nIn addition to our contracts with NAPM, we provide other revenue-generating services to clients in the communications sector and a wide variety of other sectors, trade associations, and government agencies. For example, we serve as the provider of NPAC Services in Canada; as operator of the .biz registry under contract with ICANN; as operator of the registry of U.S. Common Short Codes; as the provider of DNS services to a wide variety of major corporations, and as a provider of data services to major retailers and marketers. Each of these contracts provides for early termination in limited circumstances, most notably if we are in default. In addition, our contracts to serve as the North American Numbering Plan Administrator and as the National Pooling Administrator, each of which is with the U.S. government, may be terminated by the government at will.\nIf we fail to meet the expectations of the FCC, the U.S. Department of Commerce or any of our other clients that has the right to unilaterally terminate their contracts with us for any reason, including for performance-related or other reasons, the clients may unilaterally terminate the contracts or require us to modify the contracts in ways unfavorable to us, either of which could lead to an unexpected loss of revenue and adversely affect our operating performance. The loss or significant modification of a major contract also could cause us to suffer a loss of reputation that would make it more difficult for us to compete for contracts to provide similar services in the future. Further, a termination arising out of our default under a contract could expose us to liability for breach of contract.\nFailure to comply with neutrality requirements could result in loss of significant contracts.\nPursuant to orders and regulations of the U.S. government and provisions contained in our material contracts, we must comply with certain ongoing neutrality requirements, meaning generally that we cannot favor any particular telecommunications service provider, interconnected VoIP provider, telecommunications industry segment, technology, or group of telecommunications consumers over any other telecommunications or VoIP service provider, industry segment, technology, or group of consumers in the conduct of our business. The FCC oversees our compliance with the neutrality requirements applicable to us in connection with some of the services we provide. We provide to the FCC and the NANC, a federal advisory committee established by the FCC to advise and make recommendations on telephone numbering issues, regular certifications relating to our compliance with these requirements. Our ability to comply with the neutrality requirements to which we are subject may be affected by the activities of our stockholders or lenders. For example, if the ownership of our capital stock subjects us to undue influence by parties with a vested interest in the outcome of numbering\nadministration, the FCC could determine that we are not in compliance with our neutrality obligations. Our failure to continue to comply with the neutrality requirements to which we are subject under applicable orders and regulations of the U.S. government and commercial contracts may result in fines, corrective measures, termination of our contracts, or exclusion from bidding on future contracts, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRegulatory and statutory changes that affect us or the communications industry in general may increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nCertain of our domestic operations and many of our clients\u2019 operations are subject to regulation by the FCC and other federal, state and local agencies. As communications technologies and the communications industry continue to evolve, the statutes governing the communications industry or the regulatory policies of the FCC may change. If such statutory or regulatory changes were to occur, the demand for many of our services could change in ways that we cannot predict and our revenue could decline, or our costs could increase due to such changes. These risks include the ability of the federal government, most notably the FCC, the Department of Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission, to:\n\u2022\nincrease or change regulatory oversight over services we provide;\n\u2022\nadopt or modify statutes, regulations, policies, procedures or programs in ways that are disadvantageous to the services we provide, or that are inconsistent with our current or future plans, or that require modification of the terms of our existing contracts or contracts like the NPAC that are subject to a competitive proposal process, including the manner in which we charge for certain of our services. For example,\n\u2022\nin November 2005 major carriers filed petitions with the FCC seeking changes in the way our clients are billed for services provided by us under our contracts with North American Portability Management LLC; Verizon Corporation filed a similar petition with the FCC in May 2011;\n\u2022\nafter the amendment of our contracts with NAPM in September 2006, Telcordia filed a petition with the FCC requesting an order that would require North American Portability Management LLC to conduct a new bidding process to appoint a provider of telephone number portability services in the United States. In response to our amendment of these contracts in January 2009, Telcordia filed another petition asking that the FCC abrogate these contracts and initiate a government managed procurement in their place. If successful, either of these petitions could result in the loss of one or more of our contracts with North American Portability Management LLC or otherwise frustrate our strategic plans. Although the FCC has not initiated a formal rulemaking process on either of the Telcordia petitions, the FCC\u2019s Wireline Competition Bureau issued orders on March 8, 2011 and May 16, 2011 for NAPM to complete a process to select the next LNPA at the expiration of the current contracts. See \u201c-The revenue we receive under our seven contracts with North American Portability Management LLC represents, in the aggregate, a substantial portion of our overall revenue. These contracts are not exclusive and could be terminated or modified in ways unfavorable to us. These contracts are due to expire in June 2015 and are currently subject to a competitive proposal process. If we are not selected to continue to provide these services, or if these contracts are terminated or modified in a manner that is adverse to us, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\u201d; and\n\u2022\nin January 2014, the FCC issued a Report and Order and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and Notice of Inquiry, commencing voluntary experiments intended to assess the impact of the potential future transition in the telecommunications industry from traditional dedicated circuit network architecture to a design where all forms of traffic - voice, video, and information - are transmitted digitally over IP-based networks, or the IP Transition. Although the purpose of the experiments is to gather data only and no specific regulatory changes relating to the IP Transition have been proposed, this FCC action may indicate increasing momentum in connection with the implementation of the IP Transition;\n\u2022\nprohibit us from entering into new contracts or extending existing contracts to provide services to the communications industry based on actual or suspected violations of our neutrality requirements, business performance concerns, or other reasons;\n\u2022\nadopt or modify statutes, regulations, policies, procedures or programs in a way that could cause changes to our operations or costs or the operations of our clients (e.g., regulatory changes to support IP Transition);\n\u2022\nappoint, or cause others to appoint, substitute or add additional parties to perform the services that we currently provide including abrogation of our contracts to provide NPAC Services; and\n\u2022\nprohibit or restrict the provision or export of new or expanded services under our contracts, or prevent the introduction of other services not under the contracts based upon restrictions within the contracts or in FCC policies.\nIn addition, we are subject to risks arising out of the delegation of the Department of Commerce\u2019s responsibilities for the domain name system to ICANN. Changes in the regulations or statutes to which our clients are subject could cause our clients to alter or decrease the services they purchase from us. We cannot predict when, or upon what terms and conditions, further regulation, deregulation or litigation designed to delay or prevent the introduction of new top-level domains might occur or the effect future regulation or deregulation may have on our business.\nFurther, the current regulatory environment for Internet communications, products and services generally is uncertain and various laws and governmental regulations, both in the U.S. and abroad, governing Internet related services, related communications services and information technologies remain largely unsettled. It may take several years to determine whether and how existing laws, such as those governing intellectual property, privacy, libel, telecommunications services and taxation, apply to the Internet and to related products and services such as ours, and substantial resources may be required to comply with regulations or bring any non-compliant business practices into compliance with such regulations. Our failure or the failure of our clients and others with whom we transact business to comply with existing or future regulatory or other legal requirements could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, the value of our services and solutions could be diminished.\nOur success is dependent in part on obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our proprietary rights and our ability to avoid infringing on the proprietary rights of others. While we take precautionary steps to protect our technological advantages and intellectual property and rely in part on patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws, we cannot assure that the precautionary steps we have taken will completely protect our intellectual property rights. Effectively policing our intellectual property is time consuming and costly, and the steps taken by us may not prevent infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary rights in our products, technology and trademarks, particularly in foreign countries where in many instances the local laws or legal systems do not offer the same level of protection as in the United States. Further, because patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy until either the patent application is published or a patent is issued, we may not be aware of third-party patents, patent applications and other intellectual property relevant to our services and solutions that may block our use of our intellectual property or may be used by third-parties who compete with our services and solutions. As we expand our business and introduce new services and solutions, there may be an increased risk of infringement and other intellectual property claims by third-parties. From time to time, we and our clients may receive claims alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, or may become aware of certain third-party patents that may relate to our services and solutions.\nAdditionally, some of our client agreements require that we indemnify our clients for infringement claims resulting from their use of our intellectual property embedded in their products. Any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. The complexity of the technology involved, and the number of parties holding intellectual property within the communications industry, increase the risks associated with intellectual property litigation. Moreover, the commercial success of our services and solutions may increase the risk that an infringement claim may be made against us. Royalty or licensing arrangements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any infringement claim successfully asserted against us or against a client for which we have an obligation to defend could result in costly litigation, the payment of substantial damages, and an injunction that prohibits us from continuing to offer the service or solution in question, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe markets for our services are competitive, and if we do not adapt our organization and services to meet rapid technological and market change, we could lose clients or market share.\nOur future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to continue to adapt our products, services, and organization to meet the demands of rapidly evolving markets and industry standards. We compete against well-funded providers of data registry, information and analytics services, as well as communications software companies and system integrators. In addition, our industry is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, and frequent new service offerings. Significant technological changes could make our technology and services obsolete.\nAccordingly, our future success depends on our ability to: (i) adapt our products, services, organization, workforce, and sales strategies to fit the rapidly changing needs of current and future clients; (ii) identify emerging technological and other trends in our target markets; and (iii) develop or acquire and bring to market competitive products and services quickly and cost-effectively by continually improving the features, functionality, reliability and responsiveness of our services, and by developing new features, services and applications to meet changing client needs. Our ability to take advantage of\nopportunities in the market may require us to invest considerable resources adapting our organization and capabilities to support development of products and systems that can support new services or be integrated with new technologies and incur other expenses well in advance of our ability to generate revenue from these services. These development efforts may divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, management time and attention from other matters, and may not lead to the development of new products or services on a timely basis.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will be able to adapt to these challenges or respond successfully or in a cost-effective way, particularly in the early stages of launching a new service. Further, we may experience delays in the development of one or more features of our solutions, which could materially reduce the potential benefits to us for providing these services. Potential clients may not adopt our solutions and we may not be able to reach acceptable contract terms with clients to provide these services.\nAs a result, the failure to effectively adapt our organization, products and services to the needs of our markets or the failure of our offerings to gain market acceptance, could significantly reduce our revenues, increase our operating costs or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our failure to adapt to meet market demand in a cost-effective manner could adversely affect our ability to compete and retain clients or market share.\nIf we are not able to obtain the data required to provide our information services, or we obtain inaccurate data, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nMuch of the data that we use in connection with our information and analytics services is purchased or licensed from third parties, obtained from public record sources or provided to us as part of a broader business relationship with a client. If we are not able to obtain this data on favorable economic terms or otherwise, or link to this data, or if the data we obtain is inaccurate, our ability to provide information and analytics services to our clients could be materially adversely impacted, which could result in decreased revenue, net income and earnings per share.\nRegulatory and statutory requirements, changes in requirements regarding privacy and data protection or public perceptions of data usage may increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nOur business operations are subject to a variety of complex privacy and data protection laws and regulations in the United States at both the state and federal levels, and in other jurisdictions. These statutory and regulatory requirements are evolving, increasing in complexity and number, and may change significantly. How companies collect, process, use, store, share or transmit personal data is subject to increasing scrutiny by governments as well as the public, which could influence the adoption of legislation or regulation. There may be conflicts among the privacy and data protections laws adopted by the various countries in which we operate. Judicial and regulatory application and interpretation of these statutory and regulatory requirements are often uncertain and could be interpreted in ways that could restrict our use of data to provide information and analytics services to our clients or otherwise harm our business. We may need to incur significant costs or modify our business practices and/or our services in order to comply with existing or revised laws and regulations, or to adapt to changing public attitudes about data usage. Any restrictions on our ability to provide services to clients or costs to modify our business practices and/or services could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or prospects. If we are not able to comply with applicable laws, we may be subject to significant monetary penalties, orders demanding that we cease alleged noncompliant activities, fines and/or criminal prosecution in one or more jurisdictions. These or other remedies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition. Our failure or alleged failure to comply with privacy and data protection laws, or with public attitudes about data usage, including any perception of our practices as an invasion of privacy, could harm our reputation, result in legal actions against us by governmental authorities or private claimants or cause us to lose clients, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or prospects.\nReorganization activities could disrupt our business and affect our results of operations.\nWe have previously taken steps, including reductions in force, office closures, and internal reorganizations to reduce the size and cost of our operations, improve efficiencies, and align our organization and staffing to better match our market opportunities and our technology development initiatives. We may take similar steps in the future as we seek to realize additional operating synergies and profitability objectives, or better reflect changes in the strategic direction of our business. These changes could be disruptive to our business, including our research and development efforts, and may result in significant expense, including accounting charges for technology-related write-offs, workforce reduction costs and charges relating to consolidation of facilities. Substantial expense or charges resulting from reorganization activities could adversely affect our results of operations and use of cash in those periods in which we undertake such actions.\nIf we are unable to manage our costs, our profits could be adversely affected.\nHistorically, sustaining our growth has placed significant demands on our management as well as on our administrative, operational and financial resources. For us to continue to manage our expanded operations, as well as any future growth, we must continue to improve our operational, financial and management information systems and expand, motivate and manage our workforce. If our quality of service is compromised because we are unable to successfully manage our costs, or if new systems that we implement in connection with any future restructuring to assist in managing our operations do not produce the expected benefits, we may experience higher turnover in our client base and our revenue and profits could be adversely affected.\nChanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability. In addition, audits by tax authorities could result in additional tax payments for prior periods.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate can be affected by changes in our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates (including as a result of business acquisitions and dispositions), changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, establishment of accruals related to contingent tax liabilities and period-to-period changes in such accruals, the expiration of statutes of limitations, the implementation of tax planning strategies and changes in tax laws. The impact of these factors may be substantially different from period to period. Due to the ambiguity of tax laws and the subjectivity of factual interpretations, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. In addition, our income tax returns are subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities, which may negatively affect our results of operations. Moreover, indemnification rights that we may have in respect of tax liabilities may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such liabilities.\nOur operating results and margins could fluctuate due to factors relating to stock-based compensation.\nSimilar to many other companies, we use stock awards as a form of compensation for certain employees and non-employee directors. We must recognize the fair value of all stock-based awards, including grants of employee stock options, in our financial statements. The valuation model we use to estimate the fair value of our stock-based awards requires us to make several estimates and assumptions, such as the expected holding period of the awards and expected price volatility of our common stock. The amount we recognize for stock-based compensation expense could vary materially depending on changes in these estimates and assumptions. Other factors that could impact the amount of stock-based compensation expense we recognize include changes in the mix and type of stock-based awards we grant, changes in our compensation plans or tax rate, changes in the award forfeiture rate and differences in our company\u2019s actual operating results compared to management\u2019s estimates for performance-based awards.\nChanges in accounting principles and guidance, or their interpretation, could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects, including changes to previously filed financial statements.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. A change in these principles or guidance, or in their interpretations, may have a significant effect on our reported results and may retroactively affect previously reported results.\nWe must recruit and retain skilled employees to succeed in our business, and our failure to recruit and retain qualified employees could harm our ability to maintain and grow our business.\nWe believe that our success depends upon the continued contributions of our management team and other key employees, including our engineering, sales and marketing and operations personnel. Our success is also contingent upon our continuing ability to recruit, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled employees for all areas of our organization. Any of the following factors may affect our ability to motivate and retain our existing employees and recruit new employees:\n\u2022\ncompetition for employees with the skills we require to operate and grow our business is intense, and, as a result, our competitors may seek to hire our key employees;\n\u2022\ndespite our comprehensive compensation packages, we may not be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees; and\n\u2022\nany adverse change in reputation, whether as a result of decreases in revenue, an unfavorable outcome, or uncertainty about the outcome, in the competitive proposal process for the new contracts with NAPM, or a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nOur ability to maintain and grow our business and to compete effectively could be impaired if we are unable to retain and motivate our existing employees and recruit new employees. If we are unable to retain existing employees, we may incur additional costs to recruit and train new employees, which may decrease our profits.\nOur failure to achieve or sustain market acceptance of our services at desired pricing levels could impact our ability to maintain profitability or positive cash flow.\nOur competitors and clients may cause us to reduce the prices we charge for our services and solutions. The primary sources of pricing pressure include:\n\u2022\ncompetitors offering our clients services at reduced prices, or bundling and pricing services in a manner that makes it difficult for us to compete. For example, a competing provider of Internet infrastructure services might offer its services at lower rates than we do, or a competing domain name registry provider may reduce its prices for domain name registration;\n\u2022\nclients with a significant volume of transactions may have enhanced leverage in pricing negotiations with us; and\n\u2022\npotential clients may find it economically advantageous to handle certain functions internally instead of using our services.\nWe may not be able to offset the effects of any price reductions by increasing the number of transactions we handle or the number of clients we serve, by generating higher revenue from enhanced services or by reducing our costs.\nOur expansion into international markets may be subject to uncertainties that could increase our costs to comply with regulatory requirements in foreign jurisdictions, disrupt our operations, and require increased focus from our management.\nWe currently provide services to clients located in various international locations. We intend to pursue additional international business opportunities. International operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous additional risks, including:\n\u2022\neconomic and political risks in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate or seek to operate;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;\n\u2022\ndifferences in foreign laws and regulations, including foreign tax, intellectual property, privacy, labor and contract law, as well as unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndiffering technology standards and pace of adoption;\n\u2022\nexport restrictions on encryption and other technologies;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and any imposition of currency exchange controls;\n\u2022\nincreased competition by local, regional, or global companies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining positive relationships with foreign governments and government officials; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties associated with managing a large organization spread throughout various countries.\nIf we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. However, any of these factors could adversely affect our international operations and, consequently, our operating results.\nIf we are not successful in growing our information services at the rate that we anticipate, our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nOur ability to successfully grow our information services depends on a number of different factors, including market acceptance of our information services products and analytics solutions, the expansion of our information services capabilities and geographic coverage, and continued public and regulatory acceptance of data usage for the provision of our information services and analytics solutions, among others. If we are not successful in growing our information services business at the rate that we anticipate, we may not meet expected growth and gross margin projections or expectations, and our operating results, prospects and the market price of our securities could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to complete acquisitions, or we may undertake acquisitions that increase our costs or liabilities or are disruptive to our business.\nWe have made a number of acquisitions in the past, and one of our strategies is to pursue acquisitions selectively in the future. We may not be able to locate acquisition candidates at prices that we consider appropriate or on terms that are satisfactory to us. If we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may not be able to successfully negotiate the terms of the acquisition or, if the acquisition occurs, integrate the acquired business into our existing business. Acquisitions of businesses or other material operations may require additional debt or equity financing, resulting in additional leverage or dilution to our stockholders.\nIntegration of acquired business operations is a time consuming process that could disrupt our business by diverting significant management attention and resources away from day-to-day operations. The difficulties of integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations, integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures. It is also possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, suppliers, distributors, creditors, or lessors, or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. Further, if we cannot successfully integrate an acquired company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, the reliability of our financial statements may be impaired and we may not be able to meet our reporting obligations under applicable law. Any such impairment or failure could cause investor confidence and, in turn, the market price of our common stock, to be materially adversely affected.\nEven if we are able to integrate acquired businesses successfully, we may not realize the full benefits of the cost efficiencies or synergies or other benefits that we anticipated when selecting our acquisition candidates or that these benefits will be achieved within a reasonable period of time. We may be required to invest significant capital and resources after acquisition to maintain or grow the businesses that we acquire. In addition, we may need to record write-downs from impairments of goodwill, intangible assets, or long-lived assets, or record adjustments to the purchase price that occur after the closing of the transaction, which could reduce our future reported earnings. If we fail to successfully integrate and support the operations of the businesses we acquire, or if anticipated revenue enhancements and cost savings are not realized from these acquired businesses, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be materially adversely affected. Further, acquired businesses may have liabilities, neutrality-related risks or adverse operating issues that we fail to discover through due diligence prior to the acquisition. These liabilities could include employment, retirement or severance-related obligations under applicable law, other benefits arrangements, legal claims, warranty or similar liabilities to clients, claims by or amounts owed to vendors, tax liabilities or other amounts owed by the acquired companies. The failure to discover such issues prior to such acquisition, should they be significant, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we include in our annual report a report containing management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year and a statement as to whether or not such internal controls are effective. Compliance with these requirements has resulted in, and is likely to continue to result in, significant costs and the commitment of time and operational resources. Changes in our business, including certain initiatives to transform business processes, to invest in information systems or to transition certain functions to third party resources or providers, will necessitate modifications to our internal control systems, processes and information systems as we optimize our business and operations. We cannot be certain that our current design for internal control over financial reporting, or any additional changes to be made, will be sufficient to enable management to determine that our internal controls are effective for any period, or on an ongoing basis. If we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, market perception of our financial condition and the trading price of our stock may be adversely affected, and client perception of our business may suffer.\nRisks related to financial market conditions\nWe may be unable to raise additional capital, if needed, or to raise capital on favorable terms.\nThe general economic and capital market conditions in the United States and other parts of the world deteriorated significantly in 2008, adversely affecting access to capital and increasing the cost of capital. Although conditions have improved, a large degree of uncertainty remains both domestically and abroad, which continues to adversely impact access to, and the cost of, capital. If funds generated by our operations or available under our 2013 Credit Facilities are insufficient to fund our future activities, including acquisitions, organic business ventures, or capital expenditures, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. If unfavorable capital market conditions exist when we seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms or at all. Failure to obtain capital on\na timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and we may not be able to fund further organic and inorganic growth of our business.\nRisks related to the notes and our other indebtedness\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the notes.\nAs of December 31, 2014, borrowings under our 2013 Credit Facilities and Senior Notes were approximately $783.3 million, and we had unused revolving commitments of $8.2 million (after giving effect to borrowings of $175.0 million and $16.8 million of outstanding letters of credit). In addition, the 2013 Term Facility allows us to request one or more increases to the available term commitments under such facility. We are entitled to request such increases in an amount such that, after giving effect to such increases, either (a) the aggregate amount of increases does not exceed $400 million or (b) our consolidated secured leverage ratio on a pro forma basis after giving effect to any such increase is below 2.50 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2014, the total amount of such potential incremental increases we could request was approximately $631.5 million.\nSubject to the limits contained in the credit agreement that governs our 2013 Term Facility, the indenture that governs the Senior Notes and our other debt instruments, we may be able to incur substantial additional debt from time to time to finance investments or acquisitions, or for other general corporate purposes. If we do so, the risks related to our level of debt could intensify. Specifically, our level of debt could have important consequences to the holders of our securities, including the following:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Senior Notes and our other debt;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future acquisitions or other general corporate requirements;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments instead of other purposes, thereby reducing the amount of cash flows available for acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our 2013 Term Facility, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in the industry in which we compete;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a disadvantage compared to other, less leveraged competitors; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our cost of borrowing.\nIn addition, the indenture that governs the Senior Notes and the credit agreement that governs our 2013 Term Facility contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of the repayment of all our debt.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. The credit agreement that governs our 2013 Term Facility and the indenture that governs the Senior Notes restrict our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default and holders of the Senior Notes could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, the lenders under our 2013 Term Facility could terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our 2013 Credit Facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Assuming all loans are fully drawn, each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a $0.7 million change in annual interest expense on our indebtedness under our 2013 Credit Facilities. In the future, we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk.\nA lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.\nOur debt currently has a non-investment grade rating, and any rating assigned could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes, so warrant. Any downgrade by either Standard & Poor\u2019s or Moody\u2019s could increase the interest rate on the 2013 Credit Facilities, result in higher borrowing costs and decrease earnings. Any future adverse changes to our ratings likely would make it more difficult or more expensive for us to obtain additional debt financing.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, widely. Fluctuations in the market price of our Class A common stock could be caused by many things, including:\n\u2022\nour perceived prospects and the prospects of the telephone, Internet and data analytics industries in general;\n\u2022\ndifferences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;\n\u2022\nchanges in analysts\u2019 recommendations or projections;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in the vendor selection process to provide NPAC Services under contracts with NAPM when our current contracts expire in June 2015;\n\u2022\nchanges in general valuations for communications and data analytics companies;\n\u2022\nadoption or modification of regulations, policies, procedures or programs applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nsales of our Class A common stock by our officers, directors or principal stockholders;\n\u2022\nsales of significant amounts of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur;\n\u2022\nsales of our Class A common stock due to a required divestiture under the terms of our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic or market conditions and broad market fluctuations.\nEach of these factors, among others, could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock. Recently, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price fluctuations. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. Some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities class action\nsuits filed against them. Such a lawsuit was filed against us in July 2014. While this lawsuit was dismissed, if another class action lawsuit were to be filed against us, regardless of the outcome, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nDelaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, and the market price of our Class A common stock may be lower as a result.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our Board of Directors to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022\nprohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise enable holders of less than a majority of our voting securities to elect some of our directors;\n\u2022\nestablish a classified Board of Directors, as a result of which the successors to the directors whose terms have expired will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following election;\n\u2022\nrequire that directors only be removed from office for cause;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on the Board of Directors, including newly-created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office;\n\u2022\ndisqualify any individual from serving on our board if such individual\u2019s service as a director would cause us to violate our neutrality requirements;\n\u2022\nlimit who may call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; and\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIn order to comply with our neutrality requirements, our certificate of incorporation contains ownership and transfer restrictions relating to telecommunications service providers, VoIP providers and their respective affiliates, which may inhibit potential acquisition bids that our stockholders may consider favorable, and the market price of our Class A common stock may be lower as a result.\nIn order to comply with neutrality requirements imposed by the FCC in its orders and rules, no entity that qualifies as a \u201ctelecommunications service provider,\u201d \u201cVoIP provider\u201d or an affiliate of a telecommunications service provider or VoIP provider, as defined under the Communications Act of 1934 and FCC rules and orders, may beneficially own 5% or more of our capital stock. In general, a telecommunications service provider is an entity that offers telecommunications services to the public at large, and is, therefore, providing telecommunications services on a common carrier basis. In general, a VoIP provider is an entity that provides two-way voice communications over a broadband connection and interconnects with the public switched telephone network.\nMoreover, a party will be deemed to be an affiliate of a telecommunications service provider or a VoIP provider if that party controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, a telecommunications service provider or a VoIP provider, respectively. A party is deemed to control another if that party, directly or indirectly:\n\u2022\nowns 10% or more of the total outstanding equity of the other party;\n\u2022\nhas the power to vote 10% or more of the securities having ordinary voting power for the election of the directors or management of the other party; or\n\u2022\nhas the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the other party.\nAs a result of this regulation, subject to limited exceptions, our certificate of incorporation (a) prohibits any telecommunications service provider, VoIP provider or affiliate of a telecommunications service provider or VoIP provider from beneficially owning, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of our outstanding capital stock and (b) empowers our Board of Directors to determine whether any particular holder of our capital stock is a telecommunications service provider, VoIP provider or an affiliate of a telecommunications service provider or VoIP provider. Among other things, our certificate of incorporation provides that:\n\u2022\nif one of our stockholders experiences a change in status or other event that results in the stockholder violating this restriction, or if any transfer of our stock occurs that, if effective, would violate the 5% restriction, we may elect to purchase the excess shares (i.e., the shares that cause the violation of the restriction) or require that the excess shares be sold to a third-party whose ownership will not violate the restriction;\n\u2022\npending a required divestiture of these excess shares, the holder whose beneficial ownership violates the 5% restriction may not vote the shares in excess of the 5% threshold; and\n\u2022\nif our Board of Directors, or its permitted designee, determines that a transfer, attempted transfer or other event violating this restriction has taken place, we must take whatever action we deem advisable to prevent or refuse to give effect to the transfer, including refusal to register the transfer, disregard of any vote of the shares by the prohibited owner, or the institution of proceedings to enjoin the transfer.\nAny person who acquires, or attempts or intends to acquire, beneficial ownership of our stock that will or may violate this restriction must notify us as provided in our certificate of incorporation. In addition, any person who becomes the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our stock must notify us and certify that such person is not a telecommunications service provider, VoIP provider or an affiliate of a telecommunications service provider or VoIP provider. If a 5% stockholder fails to supply the required certification, we are authorized to treat that stockholder as a prohibited owner - meaning, among other things, that we may elect to require that the excess shares be sold. We may request additional information from our stockholders to ensure compliance with this restriction. Our board will treat any \u201cgroup,\u201d as that term is defined in Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as a single person for purposes of applying the ownership and transfer restrictions in our certificate of incorporation.\nNothing in our certificate of incorporation restricts our ability to purchase shares of our capital stock. If a purchase by us of shares of our capital stock results in a stockholder\u2019s percentage interest in our outstanding capital stock increasing to over the 5% threshold, such stockholder must deliver the required certification regarding such stockholder\u2019s status as a telecommunications service provider, VoIP provider or affiliate of a telecommunications service provider or VoIP provider. In addition, to the extent that a repurchase by us of shares of our capital stock causes any stockholder to violate the restrictions on ownership and transfer contained in our certificate of incorporation, that stockholder will be subject to all of the provisions applicable to prohibited owners, including required divestiture and loss of voting rights.\nThese restrictions and requirements may:\n\u2022\ndiscourage industry participants that might have otherwise been interested in acquiring us from making a tender offer or proposing some other form of transaction that could involve a premium price for our shares or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders; and\n\u2022\ndiscourage investment in us by other investors who are telecommunications service providers or VoIP providers or who may be deemed to be affiliates of a telecommunications service provider or VoIP provider, which may decrease the demand for our Class A common stock and cause the market price of our Class A common stock to be lower.", "PERMNO": 90763, "SIC": 4899, "TIC": "NSR"}
