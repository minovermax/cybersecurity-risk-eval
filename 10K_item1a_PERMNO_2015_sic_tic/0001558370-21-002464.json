{"cik": "1529463", "company": "FTS International, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-05", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThere are several risks related to our business. Among these important risks are the following:\n\u25cf Our business depends on domestic spending by the onshore oil and natural gas industry, which is cyclical and has significantly declined in past periods;\n\u25cf Oil and natural gas prices are volatile and have declined significantly in past periods, which has adversely affected, and may again adversely affect, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows;\n\u25cf Our customers may not be able to maintain or increase their reserve levels going forward;\n\u25cf Competition in our industry has intensified during the current industry downturn and may intensify during future industry downturns, and we have not and may not be able to provide services that meet the specific needs of our customers at competitive prices;\n\u25cf We are dependent on a few customers operating in a single industry. The loss of one or more significant customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations;\n\u25cf We have experienced a reduction in demand and there may be a continued reduction in demand for our future services due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and competition from alternative energy sources;\n\u25cf Changes in laws and regulations could prohibit, restrict or limit our operations, increase our operating costs, adversely affect our results or result in the disclosure of proprietary information resulting in competitive harm;\n\u25cf Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs, liabilities, fines, penalties and other sanctions and additional operating restrictions or delays and can adversely impact our customers;\n\u25cf Existing or future laws and regulations related to greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business and may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to the release, capture, and use of carbon dioxide that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition; and\n\u25cf We recently emerged from bankruptcy, which may adversely affect our business and relationships.\nThe following are important factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations. Any of the following risks, as well as additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nOur business depends on domestic spending by the onshore oil and natural gas industry, which is cyclical and has significantly declined in past periods.\nOur business is cyclical and depends on the willingness of our customers to make operating and capital expenditures to explore for, develop and produce oil and natural gas in the United States. The willingness of our customers to undertake these activities depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, such as:\n\u25cf prices, and expectations about future prices, for oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf domestic and foreign supply of, and demand for, oil and natural gas and related products;\n\u25cf the level of global and domestic oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u25cf the supply of and demand for hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield services and equipment in the United States;\n\u25cf the cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u25cf available pipeline, storage and other transportation capacity;\n\u25cf lead times associated with acquiring equipment and products and availability of qualified personnel;\n\u25cf the discovery rates of new oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u25cf federal, state and local regulation of hydraulic fracturing and other oilfield service activities, as well as E&P activities, including public pressure on governmental bodies and regulatory agencies to regulate our industry;\n\u25cf the availability of water resources, suitable proppant and chemicals in sufficient quantities for use in hydraulic fracturing fluids;\n\u25cf geopolitical developments and political instability in oil and natural gas producing countries;\n\u25cf actions of OPEC, its members and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil price and production controls;\n\u25cf advances in exploration, development and production technologies or in technologies affecting energy consumption;\n\u25cf the price and availability of alternative fuels and energy sources;\n\u25cf weather conditions, natural disasters and global pandemics;\n\u25cf uncertainty in capital and commodities markets and the ability of oil and natural gas producers to raise equity capital and debt financing; and\n\u25cf U.S. federal, state and local and non-U.S. governmental regulations and taxes.\nVolatility or weakness in oil and natural gas prices (or the perception that oil and natural gas prices will decrease or remain depressed) generally leads to decreased spending by our customers, which in turn negatively impacts drilling, completion and production activity. In particular, the demand for new or existing drilling, completion and production work is driven by available investment capital for such work. When these capital investments decline, our customers\u2019 demand for our services declines. Because these types of services can be easily \u201cstarted\u201d and \u201cstopped,\u201d and oil and natural gas producers generally tend to be risk averse when commodity prices are low or volatile, we typically experience a more rapid decline in demand for our services compared with demand for other types of energy services. Any negative impact on the spending patterns of our customers may cause lower pricing and utilization for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile and have declined significantly in past periods, which has adversely affected, and may again adversely affect, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe demand for our services depends on the level of spending by oil and natural gas companies for drilling, completion and production activities, which are affected by short-term and long-term trends in oil and natural gas prices, including current and anticipated oil and natural gas prices. Oil and natural gas prices, as well as the level of drilling, completion and production activities, historically have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be highly volatile. When oil prices have declined significantly in past periods, we have correspondingly experienced a decline in pressure pumping activity levels across our customer base during these periods. The volatile oil and natural gas prices adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur customers may not be able to maintain or increase their reserve levels going forward.\nIn addition to the impact of future oil and natural gas prices on our financial performance over time, our ability to grow future revenues and increase profitability will depend largely upon our customers\u2019 ability to find, develop or acquire additional shale oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable to replace the reserves they produce. Hydraulic fractured wells are generally more short-lived than conventional wells. Our customers own or have access to a finite amount of shale oil and natural gas reserves in the United States that will be depleted over time. The production rate from shale oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted, while related per-unit production costs generally increase as a result of decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. If our customers are unable to replace the shale oil reserves they own or have access to at the rate they produce such reserves, their proved reserves and production will decline over time. Reductions in production levels by our customers over time may reduce the future demand for our services and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business has been and may continue to be adversely affected by a deterioration in general economic conditions or a weakening of the broader energy industry.\nOur results of operations have been adversely affected by the slowdown in the E&P industry. A continued or prolonged slowdown in the E&P industry could continue to adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, a prolonged economic slowdown or recession in the United States or adverse events relating to the energy industry or regional, national and global economic conditions and factors could negatively impact our operations and therefore adversely affect our results. The risks associated with our business are more acute during periods of economic slowdown or recession because such periods may be accompanied by decreased exploration and development spending by our customers, decreased demand for oil and natural gas and decreased prices for oil and natural gas.\nCompetition in our industry has intensified during the current industry downturn and may intensify during future industry downturns, and we have not and may not be able to provide services that meet the specific needs of our customers at competitive prices.\nThe markets in which we operate are generally highly competitive and have relatively few barriers to entry. The principal competitive factors in our markets are price, service quality, safety, and in some cases, breadth of products. We compete with large national and multi-national companies that have longer operating histories, greater financial, technical and other resources and greater name recognition than we do. Several of our competitors provide a broader array of services and have a stronger presence in more geographic markets. In addition, we compete with several smaller companies capable of competing effectively on a regional or local basis. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services and changes in customer requirements. Some contracts are awarded on a bid basis, which further increases competition based on price. Pricing is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job. The competitive environment may be further intensified by mergers and acquisitions among oil and natural gas companies or other events that have the effect of reducing the number of available customers. As a result of a combination of continued pressure from increased competition which began during the second half of 2018 and 2019 and decreased demand for our services in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to lower the prices for our services, which adversely affected our results of operations. If competition remains the same or increases as a result of a continued industry downturn or future industry downturns, we may be\nrequired to lower our prices, which would adversely affect our results of operations. In the future, we may lose market share or be unable to maintain or increase prices for our present services or to acquire additional business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPressure on pricing for our services resulting from increased competition and lack of demand for our services has impacted, and in the future may impact, our ability to maintain utilization and pricing for our services or implement price increases, which may also be impacted in future downturns. During any future periods of declining pricing for our services, we may not be able to reduce our costs accordingly, which could further adversely affect our results of operations. Also, we may not be able to successfully increase prices without adversely affecting our utilization levels. The inability to maintain our utilization and pricing levels, or to increase our prices as costs increase, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nStrategic determinations, including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities, are challenging, and a failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn developing our business plan, we consider allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our business including maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment of our equipment, corporate items and other alternatives. We also consider our likely sources of capital, including cash generated from operations and borrowings and borrowing availability under our Credit Agreement, dated as of November 19, 2020 (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d). Notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our business plan, new business opportunities periodically come to our attention, including possible acquisitions and dispositions. If we fail to identify optimal business strategies or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies, our financial condition and future growth may be adversely affected. Moreover, economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our business plan and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives.\nA negative shift in investor sentiment of the oil and gas industry has had and will continue to have adverse effects on our customers\u2019 operations and ability to raise debt and equity capital.\nCertain segments of the investor community have developed negative sentiment towards investing in our industry. Recent equity returns in the sector versus other industry sectors have led to lower oil and gas and related services representation in certain key equity market indices. In addition, some investors, including investment advisors and certain sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, university endowments and family foundations, have stated policies to disinvest in the oil and gas sector based on their social and environmental considerations. Certain other stakeholders have also pressured commercial and investment banks and other lenders and investors to stop financing oil and gas production and related infrastructure projects, which adversely affects our customers. Such developments, including environmental activism and initiatives aimed at limiting climate change and reducing air pollution, could result in downward pressure on the stock prices of oilfield service companies, including ours. This may also potentially result in a reduction of available capital funding for potential transactions, impacting our future financial results.\nAdditionally, negative public perception regarding our industry may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines or enforcement interpretations. Additionally, environmental groups, landowners, local groups and other advocates may oppose our customers\u2019 operations through organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage our customers\u2019 operations, intervene in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our customers\u2019 assets, or file lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt or delay the development or operation of our customers\u2019 assets. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation for our customers, which could reduce our customers\u2019 production levels over time and, as a result, may reduce demand for our services. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits that our customers require to conduct their operations to be withheld, delayed or burdened by requirements that restrict our customers\u2019 ability to profitably conduct their businesses, which would also reduce demand for our services. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for our operations.\nWe are dependent on a few customers operating in a single industry. The loss of one or more significant customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur customers are engaged in the E&P business in the United States. Historically, we have been dependent upon a few customers for a significant portion of our revenues. Our four largest customers generated approximately\n35%, 45% and 40% of our total revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For a discussion of our customers that make up 10% or more of our revenues, see \u201cBusiness-Customers\u201d in Item 1 of this annual report.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected if one or more of our significant customers ceases to engage us for our services on favorable terms or at all or fails to pay or delays in paying us significant amounts of our outstanding receivables. Although we do have contracts for multiple projects with certain of our customers, most of our services are provided on a project-by-project basis.\nAdditionally, the E&P industry is characterized by frequent consolidation activity. Changes in ownership of our customers may result in the loss of, or reduction in, business from those customers, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe extend credit to our customers, which presents a risk of nonpayment of our accounts receivable.\nWe extend credit to all our customers. During industry downturns in past periods, many of our customers experienced financial and operational challenges, and some of our customers filed for bankruptcy protection or delayed payment for our services. Given the cyclical nature of the E&P industry, our customers may continue to experience similar challenges in the future. As a result, we may have difficulty collecting outstanding accounts receivable from, or experience longer collection cycles with, some of our customers, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to employ a sufficient number of key employees, technical personnel and other skilled or qualified workers.\nThe delivery of our services and products requires personnel with specialized skills and experience who can perform physically demanding work. As a result of the volatility in the energy service industry and the demanding nature of the work, workers may choose to pursue employment with our competitors or in fields that offer a more desirable work environment. Our ability to be productive and profitable will depend upon our ability to employ and retain skilled workers. In addition, our ability to further expand our operations according to geographic demand for our services depends in part on our ability to relocate or increase the size of our skilled labor force. The demand for skilled workers in our areas of operations can be high, the supply may be limited and we may be unable to relocate our employees from areas of lower utilization to areas of higher demand. A significant increase in the wages paid by competing employers could result in a reduction of our skilled labor force, increases in the wage rates that we must pay, or both. Furthermore, a significant decrease in the wages paid by us or our competitors as a result of reduced industry demand could result in a reduction of the available skilled labor force, and there is no assurance that the availability of skilled labor will improve following a subsequent increase in demand for our services or an increase in wage rates. If any of these events were to occur, our capacity and profitability could be diminished and our growth potential could be impaired.\nWe depend heavily on the efforts of executive officers, managers and other key employees to manage our operations. The unexpected loss or unavailability of key members of management or technical personnel may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations.\nOur operations are subject to inherent risks, including operational hazards. These risks may not be fully covered under our insurance policies.\nOur operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, such as accidents, blowouts, explosions, craters, fires and oil spills. These hazards may lead to property damage, personal injury, death or the discharge of hazardous materials into the environment. The occurrence of a significant event or adverse claim in excess\nof the insurance coverage that we maintain or that is not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs is customary in our industry, our service contracts generally provide that we will indemnify and hold harmless our customers from any claims arising from personal injury or death of our employees and employees of our vendors, damage to or loss of our equipment, and pollution emanating from our equipment and services. Similarly, our customers agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claims arising from personal injury or death of their employees, damage to or loss of their equipment, and pollution caused from their equipment or the well reservoir. Our indemnification arrangements may not protect us in every case. In addition, our indemnification rights may not fully protect us if the customer is insolvent or becomes bankrupt, does not maintain adequate insurance or otherwise does not possess sufficient resources to indemnify us. Furthermore, our indemnification rights may be held unenforceable in some jurisdictions. Our inability to fully realize the benefits of our contractual indemnification protections could result in significant liabilities and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe maintain customary insurance coverage against these types of hazards. We are self-insured up to retention limits with regard to, among other things, workers\u2019 compensation and general liability. We maintain accruals in our consolidated balance sheets related to self-insurance retentions by using third-party data and historical claims history. The occurrence of an event not fully insured against, or the failure of an insurer to meet its insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses. In addition, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable. Insurance may not be available to cover any or all of the risks to which we are subject, or, even if available, it may be inadequate.\nConservation measures and technological advances could reduce demand for oil and natural gas and our services.\nFuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices could reduce demand for oil and natural gas, resulting in reduced demand for oilfield services. The impact of the changing demand for oil and natural gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have experienced a reduction in demand and there may be a continued reduction in demand for our future services due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and competition from alternative energy sources.\nOil and natural gas competes with other sources of energy for consumer demand. There are significant governmental incentives and consumer pressures to increase the use of alternative energy sources in the United States and abroad. A number of automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers are developing more fuel efficient engines, hybrid engines and alternative clean power systems using fuel cells, clean burning fuels and batteries. In 2020, we continued to experience a reduction in demand of our services as a result of alternative energy sources, including natural gas and electric fleets. Greater use of these alternatives as a result of governmental incentives or regulations, technological advances, consumer demand, improved pricing or otherwise over time will reduce the demand for our products and services and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows going forward.\nLimitations on construction of new natural gas pipelines or increases in federal or state regulation of natural gas pipelines could decrease demand for our services.\nThere has been increasing public controversy regarding construction of new natural gas pipelines and the stringency of current regulation of natural gas pipelines. Delays in construction of new pipelines, cancellation of the pipeline construction by the new administration or increased stringency of regulation of existing natural gas pipelines at either the state or federal level could reduce the demand for our services and materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nOur existing fleets require significant amounts of capital for maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment and any new fleets we build or acquire may require significant capital expenditures.\nOur fleets require significant capital investment in maintenance, upgrades and refurbishment to maintain their effectiveness. While we manufacture many of the components necessary to maintain, upgrade and refurbish our fleets, labor costs have increased in the past and may increase in the future with increases in demand, which will require us to incur additional costs to upgrade any of our existing fleets or build any new fleets.\nAdditionally, competition or advances in technology within our industry may require us to update or replace existing fleets or build or acquire new fleets. Such demands on our capital or reductions in demand for our existing fleets and the increase in cost of labor necessary for such maintenance and improvement, in each case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations require substantial capital and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all, which could limit our ability to grow.\nThe oilfield services industry is capital intensive. In conducting our business and operations, we have made, and expect to continue to make, substantial capital expenditures. Our total capital expenditures were $21.1 million, $54.4 million, and $100.5 million, respectively, in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Since 2015, we have financed capital expenditures primarily with funding from cash on hand. We may be unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and other capital resources to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures which, among other things, may prevent us from properly maintaining our existing equipment or acquiring new equipment. Furthermore, any disruptions or continuing volatility in the global financial markets may lead to an increase in interest rates or a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations. This circumstance could put us at a competitive disadvantage or interfere with our growth plans. Furthermore, our actual capital expenditures for future years could exceed our capital expenditure budgets. In the event our capital expenditure requirements at any time are greater than the amount we have available, we could be required to seek additional sources of capital, which may include debt financing, joint venture partnerships, sales of assets, offerings of debt or equity securities or other means. We may not be able to obtain any such alternative source of capital. We may be required to curtail or eliminate contemplated activities. If we can obtain alternative sources of capital, the terms of such alternative may not be favorable to us. In particular, the terms of any debt financing may include covenants that significantly restrict our operations. Our inability to grow as planned may reduce our chances of maintaining and improving profitability.\nA third party may claim we infringed upon its intellectual property rights, and we may be subjected to costly litigation.\nOur operations, including equipment, manufacturing and fluid and chemical operations may unintentionally infringe upon the patents or trade secrets of a competitor or other company that uses proprietary components or processes in its operations, and that company may have legal recourse against our use of its protected information. If this were to happen, these claims could result in legal and other costs associated with litigation. If found to have infringed upon protected information, we may have to pay damages or make royalty payments in order to continue using that information, which could substantially increase the costs previously associated with certain products or services, or we may have to discontinue use of the information or product altogether. Any of these could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nNew technology may cause us to become less competitive.\nThe oilfield services industry is subject to the introduction of new drilling and completion techniques and services using new technologies, some of which may be subject to patent or other intellectual property protections. Although we believe our equipment and processes currently give us a competitive advantage, as competitors and others use or develop new or comparable technologies in the future, we may lose market share or be placed at a competitive disadvantage. Furthermore, we may face competitive pressure to implement or acquire certain new technologies at a substantial cost. Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that may allow them to enjoy technological advantages and implement new technologies before we can. We cannot be certain that we will be\nable to implement all new technologies or products on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. Thus, limits on our ability to effectively use and implement new and emerging technologies may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nLoss or corruption of our information or a cyberattack on our computer systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe are heavily dependent on our information systems and computer-based programs, including our well operations information and accounting data. If any of such programs or systems were to fail or create erroneous information in our hardware or software network infrastructure, whether due to cyberattack or otherwise, possible consequences include our loss of communication links and inability to automatically process commercial transactions or engage in similar automated or computerized business activities. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain activities. At the same time, cyberattacks have increased. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. Our technologies, systems and networks may become the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches. These could result in the unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of our proprietary and other information or other disruption of our business operations. Any access or surveillance could remain undetected for an extended period. Our systems for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient. As cyber incidents continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. Additionally, our insurance coverage for cyberattacks may not be sufficient to cover all the losses we may experience as a result of such cyberattacks. Any additional costs could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nAdverse weather conditions could impact demand for our services or impact our costs.\nOur business could be adversely affected by adverse weather conditions. For example, unusually warm winters could adversely affect the demand for our services by decreasing the demand for natural gas or unusually cold winters could adversely affect our capability to perform our services, for example, due to delays in the delivery of equipment, personnel and products that we need in order to provide our services and weather-related damage to facilities and equipment, resulting in delays in operations. Our operations in arid regions can be affected by droughts and limited access to water used in our hydraulic fracturing operations. These constraints could adversely affect the costs and results of operations.\nA terrorist attack, armed conflict or health threat could harm our business.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States, or global or national health concerns, including the outbreak of a pandemic or contagious disease could adversely affect the U.S. and global economies and could prevent us from meeting financial and other obligations. We could experience loss of business, delays or defaults in payments from payors or disruptions of fuel supplies and markets if wells, operations sites or other related facilities are direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war or if such facilities, their workforce or supply chains are affected by a global or national health concern. Such activities or events could reduce the overall demand for oil and natural gas, which, in turn, could also reduce the demand for our products and services. Terrorist activities, the threat of potential terrorist activities and global or national health concerns and any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect our results of operations, impair our ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely impact our ability to realize certain business strategies.\nThe global spread of COVID-19 and the ongoing efforts to contain it have created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. In an effort to contain or slow the spread of COVID-19, national and local governments around the world instituted certain containment measures. As a result, the demand for our services nearly diminished in the second quarter of 2020. We were forced to alter certain aspects of our business and operations, which\nadversely affected our financial condition in 2020 and may continue to adversely affect our financial condition in future periods. The duration of these measures is unknown, may be extended and additional measures may be imposed.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf Reduced customer demand and investor confidence, instability in the credit and financial markets, volatile corporate profits, and reduced business and consumer spending, which adversely affected our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by reducing our revenues, margins and net income due to a decline in the demand and price for our services. In addition, volatility in the financial markets has increased the cost of capital and limited its availability.\n\u25cf Economic uncertainty and disruption have made it difficult for us, our customers and suppliers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities.\n\u25cf Deterioration in the financial position of our customers has impacted their ability or willingness to pay for our services and, as a result, negatively affected our operating results and, if it continues to a significant degree, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\u25cf Disruptions to our supply chain in connection with the sourcing of materials from geographic areas that have been impacted by COVID-19 and by efforts to contain its spread.\nThe full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and the various responses to it impacts our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic\u037e the effectiveness of governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic\u037e the availability and cost to access the capital markets\u037e the effect on our customers and customer demand for and ability to pay for our services\u037e and disruptions or restrictions on our employees\u2019 ability to work and travel.\nWe will continue to actively monitor the issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, or local authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and stockholders. It is not clear what the potential effects any such actions may have on our business, including the effects on our customers or suppliers, or on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, it may also heighten many of the other risks described herein and in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of this annual report.\nWe and certain of our former directors, current executive officers and stockholders are currently subject to securities class action litigation in connection with our IPO, and other litigation and legal proceedings that are expensive and time consuming, and if resolved adversely, could harm our business, financial condition or results or operation.\nA purported securities class action was filed against us and certain of our former directors, current executive officers and stockholders alleging violation of federal securities laws. We have negotiated a settlement of this lawsuit, which is pending final court approval. In the unlikely event that the court does not grant final approval of the settlement, there can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained. In connection with this litigation, we could incur substantial costs and such costs and any related settlements or judgments may not be covered by insurance, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, several of our co-defendants have requested and we have agreed to indemnify them in connection with this lawsuit. These costs are not covered by insurance and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We could also suffer an adverse impact on our reputation and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition to the class action lawsuit, we are involved in other lawsuits and legal proceedings, including arbitration, in the ordinary course of our business. Any litigation or other legal proceedings, including arbitration, could result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of operations.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain tax amortization deductions post Bankruptcy are severely limited and could be further limited with additional ownership changes.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had gross federal and state net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d) significantly in excess of $1,700 million, which if not utilized would have begun to expire starting in 2032 for federal purposes and 2020 for state purposes. Additionally, we would have been allowed to deduct approximately $190 million of amortization expense on our federal and state tax returns per year for tax years 2020 through 2025. However, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, reduces the amount of the NOLs we may use or tax amortization we may deduct for U.S. federal income tax purposes in the event of certain changes in ownership of our Company. As a result of the Plan, we experienced such a Section 382 \u201cownership change\u201d and thus the amount of pre-Chapter 11 federal NOLs that we can use to reduce our taxable income were significantly reduced to approximately $312.5 million, our pre-Chapter 11 state NOLs were significantly reduced to approximately $54 million, and the amount of tax amortization we may deduct for federal income tax purposes was reduced to approximately $86 million. This may negatively affect our results of operations for future periods by requiring us to pay U.S. federal and state income taxes that we would not have been required to pay had the pre-Chapter 11 NOLs been available to us. Further, future issuances or sales of our stock, including by our large stockholders or certain other transactions involving our stock that are outside of our control, could cause additional \u201cownership changes\u201d that limit our ability to use our remaining NOLs. Any such limitation could result in our retaining less cash after payment of U.S. federal and state income taxes during any year in which we have taxable income than we would be entitled to retain if such NOLs were not reduced as an offset against such income for U.S. federal and state income tax reporting purposes, which could adversely impact our operating results.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation\nChanges in laws and regulations could prohibit, restrict or limit our operations, increase our operating costs, adversely affect our results or result in the disclosure of proprietary information resulting in competitive harm.\nVarious legislative and regulatory initiatives have been undertaken or are being discussed that could result in additional requirements or restrictions being imposed on our operations, ban hydraulic fracturing or end new fossil fuel leases and/or hydraulic fracturing on public lands. If any of these initiatives are implemented our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected. Legislation and/or regulations are being considered at the federal, state and local levels that could impose chemical disclosure requirements (such as restrictions on the use of certain types of chemicals or prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing operations in certain areas) and prior approval requirements. If they become effective, these regulations would establish additional levels of regulation that could lead to operational delays and increased operating costs. Disclosure of our proprietary chemical information to third parties or to the public, even if inadvertent, could diminish the value of our trade secrets and could result in competitive harm to us, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, some jurisdictions are or have considered zoning and other ordinances that could impose a de facto ban on drilling and/or hydraulic fracturing operations, and are closely examining permit and disposal options for processed water, which if imposed could have a material adverse impact on our operating costs. Moreover, any moratorium or increased regulation of our raw materials vendors, such as our proppant suppliers, could increase the cost of those materials and adversely affect the results of our operations.\nWe are subject to the requirements of OSHA\u2019s Respirable Crystalline Silica Standard, which requires employers to limit worker exposures to respirable crystalline silica and to take other steps to protect workers, such as medical surveillance, providing employee training, and implementing a written exposure control plan. These requirements became applicable to hydraulic fracturing operations in the oil and gas industry on June 23, 2018. The rule also requires hydraulic fracturing operations in the oil and gas industry to implement engineering controls to limit\nexposures to the respirable silica by June 23, 2021. The Respirable Crystalline Silica Standard has and will continue to impose increased operating costs on our and our customers\u2019 business. Employee exposure to silica presents a source of potential liability to our and our customers\u2019 business, which if realized could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations.\nWe are also subject to various transportation regulations that include certain permit requirements of highway and vehicle and hazardous material safety authorities. These regulations govern such matters as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety, equipment testing, driver requirements and specifications and insurance requirements. As these regulations develop and any new regulations are proposed, we have experienced and may continue to experience an increase in related costs. We receive a portion of the proppant used in our operations by rail. Any delay or failure in rail services due to changes in transportation regulations, work stoppages or labor strikes, could adversely affect the availability of proppant. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any legislative or regulatory changes or municipal ordinances applicable to our logistics operations will be enacted and to what extent any such legislation or regulations could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations.\nFederal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs, liabilities, fines, penalties and other sanctions and additional operating restrictions or delays and can adversely impact our customers.\nOur operations and those of our customers are subject to stringent federal, state, local and tribal laws and regulations relating to, among other things, protection of natural resources, clean air and drinking water, wetlands, endangered species, greenhouse gasses, areas that are not in attainment with air quality standards, the environment, health and safety, chemical use and storage, waste management, waste disposal and transportation of waste and other hazardous and nonhazardous materials. Compliance with such laws and regulations can increase our cost of doing business, delay our operations, decrease our profitability and adversely impact the demand for our services. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or if environmental incidents occur in connection with our operations, we could be subject to the shutdown of our operations, administrative, civil or criminal fines and penalties, revocations of or restrictions in permits to conduct business, expenditures for remediation or other corrective measures and claims for liability for property damage, exposure to hazardous materials, exposure to hazardous waste, nuisance or personal injuries, which could cause us to incur substantial costs or losses and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects and results of operations. Some environmental laws and regulations may impose strict liability, joint and several liability or both. Strict liability means that we could be exposed to liability as a result of our conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or the conduct of or conditions caused by third parties without regard to whether we caused or contributed to the conditions. Additionally, an increase in regulatory requirements, limitations, restrictions or moratoria on oil and natural gas exploration and completion activities at a federal, state or local level could significantly delay or interrupt our operations, limit the amount of work we can perform, increase our costs of compliance, or increase the cost of our services, and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to conduct hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling activities. Hydraulic fracturing is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals, or proppants, under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. Federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process as well. Examples include the June 2016 final rule published by EPA prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants, the May 2014 prepublication of EPA\u2019s Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing, which, to date, has not been the subject of further rulemaking, and the 2012 rule published by EPA under the Clean Air Act governing performance standards, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing. In addition, although the SDWA exempts hydraulic fracturing from the definition of \u201cunderground injection,\u201d EPA has asserted regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel fuel and published proposed guidance relating to such practices. Legislation to amend the SDWA, to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of \u201cunderground injection\u201d and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to\nrequire disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, has been proposed from time to time in Congress.\nIn 2015, the BLM enacted a new rule imposing a variety of regulatory mandates for hydraulic fracturing on federal land, which was rescinded by the U.S. Department of the Interior in December 2017. In 2016, BLM promulgated regulations aimed at curbing air pollution, including greenhouse gases, for oil and natural gas produced on federal and Indian lands, but a number of waste prevention requirements were rescinded in 2018. On July 15, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California vacated the U.S. Department of the Interior\u2019s rescission of the 2015 rule. The outcome of ongoing litigation relating to the BLM rules, as well as any efforts to reissue them, or impose other limitations on oil and gas operations on federal lands, including any such efforts by the presidential administration, cannot be predicted.\nEnvironmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices, including its potential impacts on drinking water sources, have become the subject of increasing scrutiny by governmental authorities. This scrutiny, including ongoing or proposed studies of hydraulic fracturing could spur initiatives to further regulate the practice, and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly to perform fracturing and increase the costs of compliance and doing business for our customers.\nIn addition, certain states have issued bans on hydraulic fracturing activities, including Maryland, New York and Vermont and several states, including Texas, Colorado, Pennsylvania and Ohio, as well as regional authorities like the Delaware River Basin Commission and local jurisdictions, have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids. Any increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing, in these or other states, could reduce the demand for our services and materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nThere has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, induced seismic activity, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. If new laws or regulations are adopted that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal, state or local level, including by the presidential administration, our customers\u2019 fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Such legislative or regulatory changes could cause us or our customers to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal, state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing.\nExisting or future laws and regulations related to greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business and may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to the release, capture, and use of carbon dioxide that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nChanges in environmental requirements related to greenhouse gases and climate change may negatively impact demand for our services. For example, oil and natural gas exploration and production may decline as a result of environmental requirements, including land use policies responsive to environmental concerns. Local, state, and federal agencies have been evaluating climate-related legislation and other regulatory initiatives that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business. Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws and regulations related to greenhouse gases and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business\nif such laws or regulations reduce demand for oil and natural gas. Likewise, such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to the release, capture, sequestration, and use of carbon dioxide or other gases that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nCongress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs and there have been a number of federal regulatory initiatives to address GHG emissions in recent years. These include the establishing of Title V operating and Prevention of Significant Deterioration construction permitting reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that are already major potential sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions, establishing GHG emissions standards on fossil fuel fired power plants, and the implementation of a GHG monitoring and reporting program for certain sectors of the natural gas and oil industry, including onshore production, which includes certain of our operations. Additionally, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs, in which major sources of GHG emissions acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs.\nIn 2016, the EPA finalized new regulations in 2016 that would set volatile organic compound (\u201cVOC\u201d) and methane emission standards for new and modified oil and gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities. Those standards regulate GHGs through limitations on emissions of methane. However, in September 2020, the EPA published a final rule amending the 2016 regulations by removing sources in the transmission and storage segment from the oil and natural gas source category and rescinding the new source performance standards (including VOC and methane requirements) applicable to these sources, and separately rescinding the methane-specific requirements applicable to sources in the production and processing segments of the industry. These final rules have become subject to legal challenges and the outcome of these challenges is uncertain. In addition, these standards may be subject to reconsideration pursuant to an executive order issued by President Biden on January 20, 2021, which specifically calls for a proposal to suspend, revise or rescind the September 2020 final rule making technical amendments to the 2016 Standards by September 2021. The executive order also calls on the EPA to consider new regulations governing methane and volatile organic compound emissions from existing onshore oil and gas operations by September 2021.\nNotwithstanding these federal standards, state regulations with respect to emissions of GHGs could continue to become more restrictive regardless of the decreased burdens under federal regulations. For example, in June 2018 the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (\u201cPDEP\u201d) adopted heightened permitting conditions for all newly permitted or modified natural gas compressor stations, processing plants and transmission stations constructed, modified, or operated in Pennsylvania in an effort to regulate emissions of the GHG methane at such sites. Then, in December 2019, the PDEP proposed a plan to regulate emissions of VOCs (including methane) at existing well sites and compressor stations. If these or any other actions to address GHG emissions become implemented in the future, they could result in increased costs associated with our operations, a decline in oil and natural gas exploration and production activities of our customers and affect the demand for natural gas.\nGovernmental, scientific, and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the United States, including climate change-related policies announced by the presidential administration, including regulations on hydraulic fracturing of oil and natural gas wells and limitations on new leases for production of minerals on federal properties, including onshore lands and offshore waters. Other actions that could be pursued by the presidential administration include restrictive requirements for the establishment of pipeline infrastructure or the permitting of liquefied natural gas export facilities. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of cities, local governments and other plaintiffs have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result. Such suits have also alleged that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts.\nAdoption of additional federal, regional or state requirements mandating a reduction in GHG emissions or the use of alternative energy could have far-reaching and significant impacts on the fossil fuel energy industry and the U.S. economy. Additionally, GHG emissions-related political, litigation and financial risks may result in our reduction or\nhalting of oil and gas production activities, incurrence of liability for infrastructure damage as a result of climate changes, or impairment of our ability to continue to operate in an economic manner. We cannot predict the potential impact of such laws, regulations, and international compacts, or any such political, litigation and financial risks, on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nDelays in obtaining, or inability to obtain or renew, permits or authorizations by our customers for their operations or by us for our operations could impair our business.\nIn most states, our customers are required to obtain permits or authorizations from one or more governmental agencies or other third parties to perform drilling and completion activities, including hydraulic fracturing. Such permits or approvals are typically required by state agencies, but can also be required by federal and local governmental agencies or other third parties. The requirements for such permits or authorizations vary depending on the location where such drilling and completion activities will be conducted. As with most permitting and authorization processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit or approval to be issued and the conditions which may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit. In some jurisdictions, certain regulatory authorities have delayed or suspended the issuance of permits or authorizations while the potential environmental impacts associated with issuing such permits can be studied and appropriate mitigation measures evaluated. In Texas, rural water districts have imposed restrictions on water use and may require permits for water used in drilling and completion activities. Additionally, in Utah, we work on Indian lands that require permits for drilling and completion activities. Permitting, authorization or renewal delays, the inability to obtain new permits or the revocation of current permits could cause a loss of revenue and potentially have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, prospects or results of operations.\nRestrictions on drilling activities intended to protect certain species of wildlife may adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate.\nOil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities designed to protect various wildlife, which may limit our ability to operate in protected areas. Permanent restrictions imposed to protect endangered species could prohibit drilling in certain areas or require the implementation of expensive mitigation measures. Additionally, the designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we operate could result in increased costs arising from species protection measures. Restrictions on oil and natural gas operations to protect wildlife could reduce demand for our services.\nRisks Related to Our Emergence from Chapter 11\nWe recently emerged from bankruptcy, which may adversely affect our business and relationships.\nOn September 22, 2020, we filed petitions for voluntary relief under the Bankruptcy Code. On the Effective Date, the Plan became effective in accordance with its terms and we emerged from Chapter 11.\nAs a result of our bankruptcy filing and recent emergence:\n\u25cf key suppliers, vendors or other contract counterparties may terminate their relationships with us or require additional financial assurances or enhanced performance from us;\n\u25cf our ability to renew existing contracts and compete for new business may be adversely affected;\n\u25cf our ability to attract, motivate and retain key executives and employees may be adversely affected;\n\u25cf our competitors may take business away from us, and our ability to attract and retain customers may be negatively impacted;\n\u25cf our employees may be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other employment opportunities; and\n\u25cf we may have difficulty obtaining the capital we need to operate and grow our business.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nUpon our emergence from Chapter 11, the composition of our stockholder base changed significantly.\nAs a result of the concentration of our equity ownership, our future strategy and plans may differ materially from those in the past. Upon our emergence from Chapter 11, holders of the Notes and holders of claims under the Term Loan Agreement (such holders, the \u201cSignificant Stockholders\u201d) collectively held over 90% of our common stock, while holders of our legacy equity interests held approximately 9.4% of our common stock. Therefore, the Significant Stockholders have significant control on the outcome of matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including, but not limited to, electing directors and approving corporate transactions. As a result, our future strategy and plans may differ materially from those of the past. Circumstances may occur in which the interests of the Significant Stockholders could be in conflict with the interests of other stockholders, and the Significant Stockholders would have substantial influence to cause us to take actions that align with their interests. Should conflicts arise, there can be no assurance that the Significant Stockholders would act in the best interests of other stockholders or that any conflicts of interest would be resolved in a manner favorable to our other stockholders.\nUpon our emergence from Chapter 11, the composition of our board of directors changed significantly.\nPursuant to the Plan, the composition of our board of directors changed significantly. Upon our emergence from Chapter 11, our board of directors consisted of five directors, only one of whom, our Chief Executive Officer, Michael J. Doss, had served on our board of directors prior to the Effective Date. The new directors have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those who previously served on our board of directors and thus may have different views on the issues that will determine our future. There can be no assurance that our new board of directors will pursue, or will pursue in the same manner, our previous strategy and business plans.\nCertain information contained in our historical financial statements are not comparable to the information contained in our financial statements after the adoption of fresh start accounting.\nUpon our emergence from Chapter 11, we adopted fresh start accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 852 and became a new entity for financial reporting purposes. As a result, we revalued our assets and liabilities based on our estimate of our enterprise value and the fair value of each of our assets and liabilities. These estimates, projections and enterprise valuation were prepared solely for the purpose of the bankruptcy proceedings and should not be relied upon by investors for any other purpose. At the time they were prepared, the determination of these values reflected numerous estimates and assumptions, and the fair values recorded based on these estimates may not be fully realized in periods subsequent to our emergence from Chapter 11.\nThe consolidated financial statements after the Effective Date are not comparable to the consolidated financial statements on or before that date as indicated by the \u201cblack line\u201d division in the financial statements and footnote tables, which emphasizes the lack of comparability between amounts presented. This will make it difficult for stockholders to assess our performance in relation to prior periods.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\nOur stock price has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock has varied significantly and could continue to vary significantly in the future as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. In the event of a sustained drop in the market price of our Class A common stock, our investors could lose a substantial part or all of their investment in our Class A common stock. Consequently, our investors may not be able to sell shares of our Class A common stock at prices equal to or greater than the price they paid.\nThe following factors, among others, could affect our stock price:\n\u25cf our operating and financial performance;\n\u25cf quarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as net income per share, net income and revenues;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of reports by equity research analysts;\n\u25cf speculation in the press or investment community or the dissemination of information through social media platforms;\n\u25cf sales of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders, or the perception that such sales may occur;\n\u25cf litigation involving us or that may be perceived as having an adverse effect on our business;\n\u25cf general market conditions, including fluctuations in actual and anticipated future commodity prices;\n\u25cf domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance, including the COVID-19 pandemic and Saudi-Russia price war; and\n\u25cf domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nThe requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), may increase our costs. We may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company with listed equity securities, we have to comply with numerous laws, regulations and requirements, certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, related regulations of the SEC and the requirements of NYSE American. Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements require time and attention from our board of directors and management and increase our costs and expenses. We are required to:\n\u25cf maintain a more comprehensive compliance function;\n\u25cf expand, evaluate and maintain our system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States);\n\u25cf maintain internal policies, such as those relating to disclosure controls and procedures and insider trading;\n\u25cf comply with corporate governance and other rules promulgated by the national stock exchange on which our securities are listed;\n\u25cf prepare and file annual, quarterly and other periodic public reports in compliance with the federal securities laws;\n\u25cf prepare proxy statements and solicit proxies in connection with annual meetings of our stockholders;\n\u25cf involve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the above activities; and\n\u25cf maintain a public company investor relations function.\nIn addition, being a public company subject to these rules and regulations requires us to obtain sufficient director and officer liability insurance coverage and we incur substantial costs to obtain and renew such coverage.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws:\n\u25cf provide that certain transactions between us and any stockholder that, together with any of its affiliates, owns 20% or more of our voting stock must be approved by a majority (or a higher threshold as set forth in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation) of the disinterested stockholders;\n\u25cf provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors;\n\u25cf provide that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u25cf provide that our stockholders may not take action by written consent, and may only take action at annual or special meetings of our stockholders;\n\u25cf provide that stockholders seeking to present proposals before a meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at a meeting of stockholders must provide notice in writing in a timely manner, and also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder\u2019s notice;\n\u25cf restrict the forum for certain litigation against us to Delaware;\n\u25cf not provide for cumulative voting rights (therefore allowing the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors to elect all of the directors standing for election);\n\u25cf provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the board of directors, the Chairman of the board of directors, our Secretary or stockholders with at least 25% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote on the matter or matters to be brought before the proposed special meeting;\n\u25cf provide that our amended and restated bylaws may be amended or repealed or new bylaws may be adopted by the stockholders entitled to vote thereon only at any annual or special meeting thereof or by our board of directors; and\n\u25cf provide that certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may only be amended upon receiving at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote in the election of directors.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nWe are subject to certain requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If we are unable to timely comply with Section 404 or if the costs related to compliance are significant, our profitability, stock price, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are required to comply with certain provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Section 404 requires that we document and test our internal control over financial reporting and issue management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. This section also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm opine on those internal controls upon becoming an accelerated filer, as defined in the SEC rules. During the course\nof our ongoing evaluation, we may identify areas requiring improvement, and we may have to design enhanced processes and controls to address issues identified through this review. For example, we anticipate the need to hire, or contract with, additional administrative and accounting personnel to enable us to comply with these provisions while maintaining sound financial reporting practices. We believe that the out-of-pocket costs, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from running the day-to-day operations and operational changes caused by the need to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could be significant. If the time and costs associated with such compliance exceed our current expectations and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to comply with the requirements of Section 404 or if we or our auditors identify and report such material weaknesses, the accuracy and timeliness of the filing of our annual and quarterly reports may be materially adversely affected and could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, a material weakness in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could result in an increased chance of fraud and the loss of customers, reduce our ability to obtain financing and require additional expenditures to comply with these requirements, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, investors would achieve a return on investment only if the price of our stock appreciates.\nWe currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business. Therefore, we do not currently expect to pay any cash dividends on our capital stock. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, restrictions in our debt agreements, terms of any preferred equity securities and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. If we do not make cash distributions to stockholders or otherwise return cash to stockholders, a return on investment in us will only be achieved if the market price of our securities appreciates, which may not occur, and our investors sell their securities at a profit. There is no guarantee that the price of our securities in the market will exceed the price that our investors pay.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, publish inaccurate or unfavorable research or if they downgrade our stock or our sector, our Class A common stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock or our industry, or the stock of any of our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our Class A common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our Class A common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain types of claims, which may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation specifies that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware does not have jurisdiction, a state court located within the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware)) shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum, for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us, (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by of our director, officer or other employee to us or our stockholders, creditors or other constituents, or a claim of aiding and abetting any such breach of fiduciary duty, (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws, (d) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws, (e) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine or (f) any action asserting an \u201cinternal corporate claim\u201d as that term is defined in Section 115 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.\nThe foregoing choice of forum provision does not apply to any actions arising under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any claim for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district court for the District of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act against us or our directors and officers. Our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these exclusive forum provisions. The exclusive forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes against us and our directors, officers and other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits, or may require increased costs to bring a claim. Further, in the event a court finds either exclusive forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be unenforceable or inapplicable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 17273, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "FTSI"}
