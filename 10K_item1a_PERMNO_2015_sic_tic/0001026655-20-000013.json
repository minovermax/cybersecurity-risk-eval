{"cik": "1026655", "company": "CORE MOLDING TECHNOLOGIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-13", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors describe various risks that may affect our business, financial condition, and operations. References to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus,\u201d and \u201cour\u201d in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section refer to Core Molding Technologies and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified or unless the context otherwise requires.\nOur business has concentration risks associated with significant customers.\nSales to four customers constituted approximately 62% of our 2019 total sales. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our total sales for this period. The loss of any significant portion of sales to any of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAccounts receivable balances with four customers accounted for 49% of accounts receivable at December 31, 2019. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers\u2019 financial condition and maintains reserves for potential bad debt losses. If the financial conditions of any of these customers were to deteriorate, impacting their ability to pay their receivables, our reserves may not be adequate which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe are continuing to engage in efforts intended to strengthen and expand our relations with significant customers, as well as provide support for our entire customer base. We have supported our position with customers through direct and active contact through our sales, quality, engineering, and operational personnel. We cannot make any assurances that we will maintain or improve our customer relationships, whether these customers will continue to do business with us as they have in the past or whether we will be able to supply these customers or any of our other customers at current levels.\nOur business is affected by the cyclical and overall nature of the industries and markets that we serve.\nThe North American heavy and medium-duty truck industries are highly cyclical. In 2019, approximately 58% of our product sales were in these industries. These industries and markets fluctuate in response to factors that are beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, interest rates, federal and state regulations (including engine emissions regulations, tariffs, import regulations, and other taxes), consumer spending, fuel costs, and our customers' inventory levels and production rates. Our manufacturing operations have a significant fixed cost component. Accordingly, during periods of changing demands, including an increase or slowdown in truck demand, the profitability of our operations may change proportionately more than revenues from operations. In addition, our operations are typically seasonal as a result of regular customer maintenance shutdowns, which typically vary from year to year based on production demands and occur in the third and fourth quarter of each calendar year. This seasonality may result in decreased net sales and profitability during the third and fourth fiscal quarters of each calendar year. Weakness in overall economic conditions or in the markets that we serve, or significant reductions by our customers in their inventory levels or future production rates, could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe may not be able to achieve the efficiencies, savings and other benefits anticipated from our cost reduction, margin improvement and other business optimization initiatives.\nIn [2019] we began implementing a turnaround plan to optimize and improve our performance and enhance our competitive position by reducing cost, increasing efficiencies and enhancing our business. Initiatives currently in process or implemented [in the past several years] include the implementing new operational systems focused on improved quality performance, labor productivity, scrap and overhead spend reductions. The successful implementation of these and other operational improvements as part of our turnaround plan present significant organizational design and other challenges. We may not achieve targeted benefits or achieve them within our expected timetable. Unexpected delays, increased costs, adverse effects on our internal control environment, inability to retain and motivate employees, or other challenges arising from these initiatives could adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated savings or other intended benefits of these activities. Additionally, the scope of these operational stabilization efforts require a substantial amount of management and operational resources to implement it effectively. These and related demands on our resources may divert the Company\u2019s attention from our ongoing business operations, which could also impact our competitive position as well as have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial conditions.\nPrice increases in raw materials and availability of raw materials could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe purchase resins and fiberglass for use in production as well as hardware and other components for product assembly. The prices for purchased materials are affected by the prices of material feed stocks such as crude oil, natural gas, and downstream\ncomponents, as well as processing capacity versus demand. We attempt to reduce our exposure to increases by working with suppliers, evaluating new suppliers, improving material efficiencies, and when necessary through sales price adjustments to customers. If we are unsuccessful in developing ways to mitigate these raw material increases we may not be able to improve productivity or realize savings from cost reduction programs sufficiently to help offset the impact of these increased raw material costs. As a result, higher raw material costs could result in declining margins and operating results.\nCost reduction and quality improvement initiatives by original equipment manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe are primarily a components supplier to the heavy and medium-duty truck industries, which are characterized by a small number of original equipment manufacturers (\u201cOEMs\u201d) that are able to exert considerable pressure on components suppliers to reduce costs, improve quality, and provide additional design and engineering capabilities. Given the fragmented nature of the industry, OEMs continue to demand and receive price reductions and measurable increases in quality through their use of competitive selection processes, rating programs, and various other arrangements. We may be unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset such price reductions. OEMs may also seek to save costs by purchasing components from suppliers that are geographically closer to their production facilities or relocating production to locations with lower cost structures and purchasing components from suppliers with lower production costs. These decisions by OEMs could require us to shift production between our facilities, move production lines between our facilities, or open new facilities to remain competitive. Shifting production, moving production lines, or opening new locations could result in significant costs required for capital investment, transfer expenses, and operating costs. Additionally, OEMs have generally required component suppliers to provide more design engineering input at earlier stages of the product development process, the costs of which have, in some cases, been absorbed by the suppliers. To the extent that the Company does not meet the quality standards or demands of quality improvement initiatives sought by OEMs, or does not match the quality of suppliers of comparable products, OEMs may choose to purchase from these alternative suppliers, and as a result the Company may lose existing or new business with OEMs. Future price reductions, increased quality standards, and additional engineering capabilities required by OEMs may reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe may be subject to product liability claims, recalls or warranty claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nAs a components supplier to OEMs, we face a business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products malfunction and result in personal injury or death. Product liability claims could result in significant losses as a result of expenses incurred in defending claims or the award of damages. In addition, we may be required to participate in recalls involving components sold by us if any prove to be defective, or we may voluntarily initiate a recall or make payments related to such claims in order to maintain positive customer relationships. While we do maintain product liability insurance, it may not be sufficient to cover all product liability claims, and as a result, any product liability claim brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Further, we warrant the quality of our products under limited warranties, and as such, we are subject to risk of warranty claims in the event that our products do not conform to our customers\u2019 specifications. Such warranty claims may result in costly product recalls, significant repair costs, and damage to our reputation, all of which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets, and if we are unable to effectively compete it may negatively impact future operating results, sales, and earnings.\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete with a number of other manufacturers that produce and sell similar products. Our products primarily compete on the basis of capability, product quality, cost, and delivery. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources, research and development facilities, design engineering, manufacturing, and marketing capabilities. If we are unable to develop new and innovative products, diversify the markets, materials, and processes we utilize and increase operational enhancements, we may fall behind competitors or lose the ability to achieve competitive advantages. In the highly competitive market in which we operate, this may negatively impact our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers, and if that occurs, it may negatively impact future operating results, sales, and earnings.\nWe may be subject to additional shipping expense or late fees if we are not able to meet our customers' on-time demand for our products.\nWe must continue to meet our customers' demand for on-time delivery of our products. Factors that could result in our inability to meet customer demands include a failure by one or more of our suppliers to supply us with the raw materials and other resources that we need to operate our business effectively and an unforeseen spike in demand for our products, which would create capacity constraints, among other factors. If this occurs, we may be required to incur additional shipping expenses to ensure on-time\ndelivery or otherwise be required to pay late fees, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIf we fail to attract and retain key personnel our business could be harmed.\nOur success largely depends on the efforts and abilities of our key personnel. Their skills, experience, and industry contacts significantly benefit us. The inability to retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our future success will also depend in part upon our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel.\nWork stoppages or other labor issues at our facilities or at our customers' facilities could adversely affect our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, unions at our Columbus, Ohio, Matamoros and Escobedo, Mexico, and Cobourg Canada facilities represented approximately 67% of our entire workforce. As a result, we are subject to the risk of work stoppages and other labor-relations matters. The current Columbus, Ohio, Matamoros and Escobedo, Mexico, and Cobourg, Canada union contracts extend through August 7, 2022, January 10, 2021, February 1, 2020 and November 1, 2021, respectively. Any prolonged work stoppage or strike at either our Columbus, Ohio; Matamoros and Escobedo, Mexico; or Cobourg, Canada unionized facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Any failure by us to reach a new agreement upon expiration of such union contracts may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nIn addition, if any of our customers or suppliers experience a material work stoppage, that customer may halt or limit the purchase of our products or that supplier may interrupt supply of our necessary production components. This could cause us to shut down production facilities relating to these products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nChanges in the legal, regulatory, and social responses to climate change, including any possible effect on energy prices, could adversely affect our business and reduce our profitability.\nIt is possible that various proposed legislative or regulatory initiatives related to climate changes, such as cap-and-trade systems, increased limits on emissions of greenhouse gases and fuel efficiency standards, or other measures, could in the future have a material impact on us, our customers, or the markets we serve, thereby resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation. For example, customers in the transportation (automotive and truck) industry could be required to incur greater costs in order to comply with such initiatives, which could have an adverse impact on their profitability or viability. This could in turn lead to further changes in the structure of the transportation industry that could reduce demand for our products. We are also reliant on energy to manufacture our products, with our operating costs being subject to increase if energy costs rise. During periods of higher energy costs we may not be able to recover our operating cost increases through production efficiencies and price increases. While we may hedge our exposure to higher prices via future energy purchase contracts, increases in energy prices for any reason (including as a result of new initiatives related to climate change) will increase our operating costs and likely reduce our profitability.\nOur foreign operations in Mexico and Canada subject us to risks that could negatively affect our business.\nWe operate manufacturing facilities in Matamoros and Escobedo, Mexico and Cobourg, Canada. As a result, a significant portion of our business and operations is subject to the risk of changes in economic conditions, tax systems, consumer preferences, social conditions, safety and security conditions, and political conditions inherent in Mexico and Canada, including changes in the laws and policies that govern foreign investment, as well as changes in United States laws and regulations relating to foreign trade and investment. Changes in laws and regulations related to foreign trade and investment may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity, or financial condition.\nBecause of our international operations, we are exposed to risk associated with value changes in foreign currencies, which may adversely affect our business. Historically, our reported net sales, earnings, cash flow, and financial condition have been subjected to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Our primary exchange rate exposure is with the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar. While we actively manage the exposure of our foreign currency risk as part of our overall financial risk management policy, we believe we may experience losses from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and such losses could adversely affect our sales, earnings, cash flow, liquidity, or financial condition.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with manufacturing equipment and infrastructure.\nWe convert raw materials into molded products through a manufacturing process at each production facility. While we maintain insurance covering our manufacturing and production facilities, including business interruption insurance, a catastrophic loss of the use of all or a portion of our facilities due to accident, fire, explosion, or natural disaster, whether short or long-term, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nUnexpected failures of our equipment and machinery may result in production delays, revenue loss, and significant repair costs, as well as injuries to our employees. Any interruption in production capability may require us to make large capital expenditures to remedy the situation, which could have a negative impact on our profitability and cash flows. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to offset the lost revenues or increased costs that we may experience during a disruption of our operations. Because we supply our products to OEMs, a temporary or long-term business disruption could result in a permanent loss of customers. If this were to occur, our future sales levels and therefore our profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with new business awards. In order to recognize profit from new business, we must accurately estimate product costs as part of the quoting process and implement effective and efficient manufacturing processes. Expected future sales from business awards may not materialize. We may not realize the sales or operating results that we anticipate from new business awards, and we may experience difficulties in meeting the production demands of new business awards.\nThe success of our business relies on our ability to produce products which meet the quality, performance, and price expectations of our customers. Our ability to recognize profit is largely dependent upon accurately identifying the costs associated with the manufacturing of our products, and executing the manufacturing process in a cost effective manner. There can be no assurance that all costs will be accurately identified during the Company's quoting process or that the expected level of manufacturing efficiency will be achieved. As a result we may not realize the anticipated operating results related to new business awards.\nWe will continue to pursue, and may be awarded, new business from existing or new customers. The Company may make capital investments, which may be material to the Company, in order to meet the expected production requirements of existing or new customers related to these business awards, and to support the potential production demands which may result from continued sales growth. The anticipated impact on the Company's sales and operating results related to these business awards, for various reasons, may not materialize. Any delays or production difficulties encountered in connection with these business awards, and any change in customer demand, could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and liquidity, and the benefits we anticipate may never materialize.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect against the potential hazards incident to our business.\nWe maintain property, business interruption, stop loss for healthcare and workers' compensation, director and officer, product liability, and casualty insurance coverage, but such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential claims, including losses resulting from war risks, terrorist acts, or product liability claims relating to products we manufacture. Consistent with market conditions in the insurance industry, premiums and deductibles for some of our insurance policies have been increasing and may continue to increase in the future. In some instances, some types of insurance may become available only for reduced amounts of coverage, if at all. In addition, there can be no assurance that our insurers would not challenge coverage for certain claims. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were not fully insured or that our insurers disputed, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.\nOur business will be adversely impacted if the coronavirus outbreak spreads widely or otherwise impacts our manufacturing and supply chain or demand for our products\nThe extent that the coronavirus outbreak will spread widely and its impact on our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable. Our facilities and suppliers could be directly impacted by actions taken to contain the virus. In addition, our facilities are dependent upon raw materials produced by others, and to the extent that our suppliers are impacted by the virus it likely will reduce the availability, or result in delays, of raw materials to us, which in turn could interrupt our ability to produce and sell completed products. Recently there have been circumstances of freight channels being interrupted and increases in the freight prices, which also could impact our business. These and other unforeseen consequences associated with the virus could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to Horizon Plastics in 2018, we have made acquisitions and may make acquisitions in the future. We may not realize the operating results that we anticipate from these acquisitions or from acquisitions we may make in the future, and we may experience difficulties in integrating the acquired businesses or may inherit significant liabilities related to such businesses.\nWe explore opportunities to acquire businesses that we believe are related to our core competencies from time to time, some of which may be material to us. We expect such acquisitions will produce operating results consistent with our other operations; however, we cannot provide assurance that this assumption will prove correct with respect to any acquisition.\nAny acquisitions, including the acquisition of Horizon Plastics, may present significant challenges for our management due to the increased time and resources required to properly integrate management, employees, information systems, accounting controls, personnel, and administrative functions of the acquired business with those of ours and to manage the combined company on a going forward basis. The diversion of management's attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of these businesses could adversely impact our business, results of operations, and liquidity, and the benefits we anticipate may never materialize.\nIf we are unable to meet future capital requirements, our business may be adversely affected.\nAs we grow our business, we may have to incur significant capital expenditures. We may make capital investments to, among other things, build new or upgrade our facilities, purchase leased facilities and equipment, and enhance our production processes. We cannot assure you that we will have, or be able to obtain, adequate funds to make all necessary capital expenditures when required, or that the amount of future capital expenditures will not be materially in excess of our anticipated or current expenditures. If we are unable to make necessary capital expenditures we may not have the capability to support our customer demands, which in turn could reduce our sales and profitability and impair our ability to satisfy our customers' expectations. In addition, even if we are able to invest sufficient resources, these investments may not generate net sales that exceed our expenses, generate any net sales at all, or result in any commercially acceptable products.\nWe may not achieve expected efficiencies related to the proximity of our customers' production facilities to our manufacturing facilities, or with respect to existing or future production relocation plans.\nCertain facilities are located in close proximity to our customers in order to minimize both our customers' and our own costs. If any of our customers were to move or if nearby facilities are closed, that may impact our ability to remain competitive. Additionally, our competitors could build a facility that is closer to our customers' facilities which may provide them with a geographic advantage. Any of these events might require us to move closer to our customers, build new facilities, or shift production between our current facilities to meet our customers' needs, resulting in additional cost and expense.\nOur products may be rendered obsolete or less attractive if there are changes in technology, regulatory requirements, or competitive processes.\nChanges in technology, regulatory requirements, and competitive processes may render certain products obsolete or less attractive. Future chemical regulations may restrict our ability to manufacture products, cause us to incur substantial expenditures to comply with them, and subject us to liability for adverse environmental or health effects linked to the manufacture of our products. Failure to comply with future regulations may subject us to penalties or other enforcement actions. Our ability to anticipate changes in these areas will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive. If we are unable to identify or compensate for any one of these changes it may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nOur stock price can be volatile.\nOur stock price can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors. Factors include actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results, our relatively small public float, changes in securities analysts' estimates of our future earnings, and the loss of major customers, or significant business developments relating to us or our competitors, and other factors, including those described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Our common stock also has a low average daily trading volume, which limits a person's ability to quickly accumulate or quickly divest themselves of large blocks of our stock. In addition, a low average trading volume can lead to significant price swings even when a relatively few number of shares are being traded.\nWe are subject to environmental, occupational health and safety rules and regulations that may require us to make substantial expenditures or expose us to financial or other obligations including substantial damages, penalties, fines, civil or criminal sanctions, and remediation costs that could adversely affect our results.\nOur operations, facilities, and personnel are subject to extensive and evolving laws and regulations pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes, health and safety, the investigation and remediation of contamination, and the protection of the environment and natural resources. It is difficult to predict the future interpretations and developments of environmental and health and safety laws and regulations or their impact on our future results and cash flows. Continued compliance could result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs. In addition, we may be exposed to obligations or involved from time to time in administrative or legal proceedings relating to environmental, health and safety or other regulatory matters, and may incur financial and other obligations relating to such matters.\nCertain senior management employees have entered into potentially costly severance arrangements with us if terminated by the employee for good reason.\nWe have entered into executive employment agreements with executive officers that provide for significant severance payments in the event such employee's employment with us is terminated by the employee for good reason (as defined in the employment agreement). Good reason includes one or more of the following occurring within one year of a change in control: (i) a material reduction in base salary, (ii) a material diminution in the executive's position and/or duties, (iii) a material breach of the employment agreement by the person or other entity then controlling the Company, or (iv) a disavowal of the employment agreement by the person or other entity then controlling the Company. A change in control occurs when (a) one person (as defined in the employment agreement), or more than one person acting as a group, acquires ownership of stock of the Company that, together with the stock held by such person or group, constitutes more than 50% of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock of the Company, (b) a majority of the members of the Company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") are replaced during any twelve-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the Board before the date of appointment or election, or (c) the sale of all or substantially all of the Company\u2019s assets. These agreements would make it costly for the employment of certain of our senior management employees to be terminated and such costs may also discourage potential acquisition proposals, which may negatively affect our stock price.\nEconomic conditions and disruptions in the financial markets could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDisruptions in the financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition if our ability to borrow money from our existing lenders were to be impaired. Disruptions in the financial markets may also have a material adverse impact on the availability and cost of credit in the future. Our ability to pay our debt or refinance our obligations will depend on our future performance, which could be affected by, among other things, prevailing economic conditions. Disruptions in the financial markets may also have an adverse effect on the U.S. and world economies, which would have a negative impact on demand for our products. In addition, tightening of credit markets may have an adverse impact on our customers' ability to finance the sale of new trucks or our suppliers' ability to provide us with raw materials, either of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur provision for income tax, adverse tax audits, or changes in tax policy could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and Mexico and, beginning in 2018, Canada. Our provision for income taxes and cash flow related to taxes may be negatively impacted by: (1) changes in the mix of earnings taxable in jurisdictions with different statutory rates, (2) changes in tax laws and accounting principles, (3) changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, (4) discovery of new information during the course of tax return preparation, (5) increases in nondeductible expenses, or (6) difficulties in repatriating earnings held abroad in a tax efficient manner.\nTax audits may also negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We are subject to continued examination of our income tax returns, and tax authorities may disagree with our tax positions and assess additional tax. We regularly evaluate the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from examinations will not have a negative impact on our future financial condition and operating results.\nOur ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may be insufficient to allow us to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and this could cause our financial statements to become materially misleading and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe require effective internal control over financial reporting in order to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial statements and effectively prevent fraud, our financial statements could become materially misleading, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIf we are not able to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be harmed. Any material weakness could affect investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements. As a result, our ability to obtain any additional financing, or additional financing on favorable terms, could be materially and adversely affected. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and the market value of our stock and require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control systems and procedures. In addition, perceptions of the Company among customers, suppliers, lenders, investors, securities analysts, and others could also be adversely affected. We cannot assure that any material weaknesses will not arise in the future due to our failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers, and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, regulatory penalties, disruption of our operations, damage to our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products, which could adversely affect our business, revenues, and competitive position.\nOur manufacturing capacity, labor force, and operations may not be appropriate for future levels of demand and may materially adversely affect our gross margins and operating results.\nWhen market demand increases, we must have available manufacturing capacity and must increase our labor force to meet increases in customer demand. We have continued to experience a significant ramp up in overall demand in the heavy-duty truck market, along with the launch of several new programs. Given the current high demand levels, the Company has experienced asset capacity constraints and difficulty hiring, training and retaining labor in a tightening labor market, which has resulted in increased manufacturing inefficiencies and the inability to consistently meet customer delivery and quality requirements, including for several of the Company\u2019s major customers. Additional expenses that we realized in 2019 and 2018 as a result of these inefficiencies include increased hiring, training, wages, overtime, non-local third party contract labor, including travel and local lodging, scrap, rework, expedited premium shipping, returns, customer charges and repairs and maintenance.\nIf we continue to experience manufacturing inefficiencies, we may continue to incur additional expenses as described above and may reduce demand through the possible temporary or permanent move of business (which may include major customers\u2019 business) to other manufacturers, which would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results.\nOngoing difficulty in hiring, training, and retaining skilled labor could result in increased cost overruns, an inability to satisfy customer demands, and otherwise adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on skilled labor in the manufacturing of our products. Given the high demand levels in 2019 and 2018, we have experienced difficulty hiring, training, and retaining labor in a tightening labor market, which has resulted in increased manufacturing inefficiencies and the inability to consistently meet customer delivery and quality requirements, including for several of the Company\u2019s major customers. Recent difficulties in securing skilled labor have resulted in increased hiring and training costs, increased overtime to meet demand, increased wage rates to attract and retain operators, the use of non-local third\nparty contract labor, and higher scrap and rework costs due to inexperienced workers. Continuation of such difficulties in securing labor could result in increased cost, an inability to satisfy customer demands, and an inability to maintain or increase production rates which would adversely affect our business.\nIn the event we engage in any restructuring of our manufacturing operations to address operational efficiencies, such actions may be disruptive to our business and may not result in anticipated cost savings.\nManagement continuously evaluates our facilities and operations in an effort to make our business more efficient. During 2019 and 2018, we have continued to experience asset capacity constraints and difficulty hiring, training, and retaining labor in a tightening labor market, which has resulted in increased manufacturing inefficiencies and the inability to consistently meet customer delivery and quality requirements, including for several of the Company\u2019s major customers. As management continues to evaluate our facilities and operations in an effort to make our business more efficient, as well as whether to move certain customers\u2019 business in order to minimize production constraints, we may incur additional costs, asset impairments, and restructuring charges in connection with changes to operations, that to the extent incurred in the future could adversely affect our future earnings and cash flows. Such actions may be disruptive to our business. Furthermore, we may not realize the cost savings that we expect to realize as a result of such actions.\nWe have incurred impairment charges that eliminated the carrying value of our goodwill associated with Core Traditional and partially eliminated Horizon Plastics goodwill business reporting units in the past; in the future we may be required to incur additional impairment charges on a portion or all of the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our reporting units, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nEach year, and more frequently on an interim basis if appropriate, we are required by ASC Topic 350, \u201cIntangibles--Goodwill and Other,\u201d to assess the carrying value of our indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill to determine whether the carrying value of those assets is impaired. Such assessment and determination involves significant judgments to estimate the fair value of our reporting units, including estimating future cash flows, near term and long term revenue growth, and determining appropriate discount rates, among other assumptions. As part of the Company\u2019s annual impairment assessment at December 31, 2018, we concluded that the carrying value of the goodwill associated with our traditional business reporting unit was greater than fair value, which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $2,403,000, representing all of the goodwill related to our traditional business reporting unit. Due to the Company's financial performance and continued depressed stock price, the Company performed a quantitative analysis for both of its reporting units at September 30, 2019. During 2019, the Company incurred a loss of margin in its Horizon Plastics reporting unit caused by selling price decreases that the Company has not been able to fully offset with material cost reductions. As a result of the quantitative analysis, the Company concluded that the carrying value of Horizon Plastics was greater than the fair value, which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $4,100,000 at September 30, 2019 representing 19% of the goodwill related to the Horizon Plastics reporting unit. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 9 - Goodwill and Intangibles, within the notes to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding goodwill impairment. The Company will continue to evaluate the HPI reporting unit goodwill on an annual basis as required by ASC Topic 350. If operating earnings consistently fall below forecasted operating earnings, we would perform an interim or annual goodwill impairment analysis. Should that analysis conclude that the reporting unit\u2019s fair value were to be below carrying value a goodwill impairment charge would be necessary. Any such charges could materially adversely affect our financial results in the periods in which they are recorded.\nOur failure to comply with our debt covenants or the terms of the Forbearance Agreement under which we are presently operating could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s amended and restated credit agreement dated January 16, 2018, as amended from time to time (the \u201cA/R Credit Agreement\u201d), with KeyBank National Association as the administrative agent (the \"Administrative Agent\") and various other financial institutions thereto as lenders (the \"Lenders\"), contains certain covenants. As of September 30, 2019 the Company was in breach of its fixed charge covenant under the A/R Credit Agreement and on November 22, 2019 entered into a forbearance agreement with the Lenders, as subsequently amended (as amended, the \u201cForbearance Agreement\u201d). A breach of any of the milestones established in the Forbearance Agreement could result in a default under our A/R Credit Agreement. Based on current financial projections, the Company does not believe that it will be compliant with the financial covenants beyond the negotiated Forbearance Period and therefore is pursuing the restructuring or refinancing of its existing obligations under the Amended A/R Credit Agreement If we were unable to effectively restructure or finance our existing obligations, default under the Forbearance Agreement could result in the acceleration of the total due related to the A/R Credit Agreement. If a default of the Forbearance Agreement were to occur, we may not be able to pay our debts or borrow sufficient funds to refinance them. Any of these events, if they occur, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe have substantial debt under out A/R Credit Agreement and may incur substantial additional debt, which could adversely affect our financial health, reduce our profitability, limit our ability to obtain financing in the future and pursue certain business opportunities and reduce the value of your investment.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had an aggregate principal amount of $49.5 million of outstanding debt. In fiscal year 2019, we incurred $4.1 million of interest expense, net of the impact of interest rate swaps, related to this debt.\nThe amount of our debt or such other obligations could have important consequences for holders of our common stock, including, but not limited to: a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes; our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes and other purposes may be impaired in the future; we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because a portion of our borrowings is at variable rates of interest; we may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with less debt or with comparable debt at more favorable interest rates and that, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns; our ability to refinance indebtedness may be limited or the associated costs may increase; our ability to engage in acquisitions without raising additional equity or obtaining additional debt financing may be impaired in the future; it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations to our creditors, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness; we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and our flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and our ability to withstand competitive pressures could be limited, or we may be prevented from making capital investments that are necessary or important to our operations in general, growth strategy and efforts to improve operating margins of our business units.\nIf our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek to obtain additional equity capital or refinance our debt. We cannot make assurances that we will be able to refinance our debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In the future, our cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for payments of interest on and principal of our debt, and such alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nWe cannot make assurances that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, or obtain additional financing, particularly because of our high levels of debt and the debt incurrence restrictions imposed by the agreements governing our debt, as well as prevailing market conditions. We could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. Subject to certain exceptions, our Term Loans and Revolving Loans, which we have defined in Note 10 - Debt to our consolidated financial statements, restrict our ability to dispose of assets and how we use the proceeds from any such dispositions. We cannot make assurances that we will be able to consummate those dispositions, or if we do, what the timing of the dispositions will be or whether the proceeds that we realize will be adequate to meet our debt service obligations, when due.\nCybersecurity attacks may threaten our confidential information, disrupt operations and result in harm to our reputation and adversely impact our business and financial performance.\nCybersecurity attacks across industries, including ours, are increasing in sophistication and frequency and may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to measures targeted specifically at us. These attacks include but are not limited to, malicious software or viruses, attempts to gain unauthorized access to, or otherwise disrupt, our information systems, attempts to gain unauthorized access to business, proprietary or other confidential information, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Cybersecurity failures may be caused by employee error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, including vulnerabilities of our vendors, suppliers, and their products. We have been subject to cybersecurity attacks in the past. Based on information known to date, past attacks have not had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We may experience such attacks in the future, potentially with more frequency or sophistication.\nFailures of our IT systems as a result of cybersecurity attacks or other disruptions could result in a breach of critical operational or financial controls and lead to a disruption of our operations, commercial activities or financial processes. Cybersecurity attacks or other disruptions impacting significant customers and/or suppliers could also lead to a disruption of our operations or commercial activities. Despite our attempts to implement safeguards on our systems and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyberattacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use our systems or networks, compromise confidential or otherwise protected information, destroy or corrupt data, or otherwise disrupt our operations. The occurrence of such events could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 84387, "SIC": 3089, "TIC": "CMT"}
