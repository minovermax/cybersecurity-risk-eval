{"cik": "31235", "company": "EASTMAN KODAK CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe Company has significantly restructured its business and adopted a new business plan, including a new segment reporting structure. The restructured Company and new business plan have been in effect for a limited period of time and there are no assurances that the Company will be able to successfully implement its business plan or successfully operate as a restructured business.\nThe Company has focused its investments on imaging and printing for business, specifically, commercial inkjet, packaging and functional (Micro 3D) printing solutions, and enterprise services and solutions. Each of these businesses requires additional investment and may not be successful. The introduction of successful innovative products at market competitive prices and the achievement of scale are necessary for us to grow these businesses, improve margins and achieve our financial objectives. Additionally, our strategy is based on a number of factors and assumptions, some of which are not within our control, such as the actions of third parties. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute all or any elements of our strategy, or that our ability to successfully execute our strategy will be unaffected by external factors. If we are unsuccessful in growing the Company\u2019s investment businesses as planned, or perceiving the needs of our target customers, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nIf Kodak is not able to successfully implement its strategic business plans, or experiences implementation delays in cost structure reduction, the Company\u2019s consolidated results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be negatively affected.\nWe recognize the need to rationalize Kodak\u2019s workforce and streamline operations to a leaner and more focused organization aligned with the emerged businesses and operations. We have implemented such cost rationalization plans including a restructuring of manufacturing, supply chain, marketing, sales and administrative resources. There are no assurances that such measures will prove to be successful or that the results we achieve through these plans will be consistent with our expectations. As a result, our results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if restructuring plans are not effectively managed, we may experience lost customer sales, product delays, additional costs and other unanticipated effects, causing harm to our business and customer relationships. The business plans are subject to a number of assumptions, projections, and analysis. If these assumptions prove to be incorrect, we may be unsuccessful in executing our business plan or achieving the projected results, which could adversely impact our financial results and liquidity. Finally, the timing and implementation of these plans require compliance with numerous laws and regulations, including local labor laws, and the failure to comply with such requirements may result in damages, fines and penalties which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nKodak\u2019s inability to effectively complete and manage partnerships and other significant transactions could adversely impact our business performance, including our financial results.\nAs part of the Company\u2019s strategy, we may be engaged in discussions with third parties regarding possible divestitures, asset sales, spin-offs, investments, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, and outsourcing transactions and may enter into agreements relating to such transactions in order to further our business objectives. In order to pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify suitable buyers, sellers and partners and successfully complete transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the elimination of any remaining post-sale costs related to divested businesses. Transaction risk can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions, or when multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously. If we fail to identify and successfully complete transactions that further the Company\u2019s strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our revenue, gross margins and profitability. In addition, unpredictability surrounding the timing of such transactions could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe may pursue acquisitions or combinations that could fail or present unanticipated problems for our business in the future, which would adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of those transactions or increase the price we would be required to pay.\nWe may seek to enter into transactions that may include acquiring or combining with other businesses. We may not be able to identify suitable acquisition or combination opportunities or finance and complete any particular acquisition or combination successfully. Furthermore, acquisitions and combinations involve a number of risks and challenges, including:\n\u00b7\nthe ability to obtain required regulatory and other approvals;\n\u00b7\nthe need to integrate acquired or combined operations with our operations;\n\u00b7\npotential loss of key employees;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in evaluating operating costs, infrastructure requirements, environmental and other liabilities and other factors beyond our control;\n\u00b7\npotential lack of operating experience in new geographic areas;\n\u00b7\nan increase in our expenses and working capital requirements;\n\u00b7\nmanagement\u2019s attention may be temporarily diverted; and\n\u00b7\nthe possibility that we may be required to issue a substantial amount of additional equity or debt securities or assume additional debt in connection with any such transactions.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect our ability to achieve anticipated levels of cash flows or realize synergies or other anticipated benefits from a strategic transaction. Furthermore, the market for transactions is highly competitive, which may adversely affect our ability to find transactions that fit our strategic objectives or increase the price we would be required to pay (which could decrease the benefit of the transaction or hinder our desire or ability to consummate the transaction). Strategic transactions may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to our assets and operations.\nIf the Company is unable to successfully develop or commercialize new products, our business, financial position and operating results may suffer.\nWe generally sell our products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time, in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer. Therefore, our future results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon our ability to successfully commercialize new products in a timely manner. The success of our new products and services will depend on several factors, including our ability to:\n\u00b7\nidentify customer needs;\n\u00b7\ninnovate and develop new technologies, services, and applications;\n\u00b7\ncommercialize new technologies in a timely manner;\n\u00b7\nmanufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time;\n\u00b7\ndifferentiate our offerings from our competitors\u2019 offerings;\n\u00b7\nprice our products and services competitively;\n\u00b7\nanticipate our competitors\u2019 development of new products, services or technological innovations;\n\u00b7\nwork successfully alongside our partners, including UniPixel, Bobst and Kingsbury; and\n\u00b7\ncontrol product quality in our manufacturing processes.\nAs a result of these and other factors, products currently in development by Kodak may or may not be successfully commercialized in a timely manner, or at all. If any of our key products cannot be successfully or timely commercialized, our operating results could be adversely affected. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that any investment we made in developing products will be recouped, even if we are successful in commercializing those products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results.\nWe may not be successful in commercializing technologies for micro 3D printing, one of our target markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial position.\nWe are in the process of commercializing technologies for micro 3D printing, one of our target markets. We may not be successful in developing and marketing products in some or all of the areas we seek to enter in micro 3D printing. Development, production, marketing or administrative costs may exceed expectations and operating cash flow generated from these products. Customers may favor other technologies or solutions, and our products may not be competitive on the basis of cost, functionality or other characteristics. In addition, our competitors may have better technologies to which we may not have access, and may have more financial or other resources to support development and marketing of their products. We rely on our partners, such as UniPixel and Kingsbury, for technology and other expertise that are key to our efforts to commercialize micro 3D printing products. Issues with either of these companies or in our relationship with them could adversely affect our plans with respect to commercialization of our technologies. The investment required to develop products may exceed our expectations. If any or all of these risks occurred, we may not realize benefits associated with our investments in micro 3D printing, and it could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial position.\nIf Kodak\u2019s commercialization and manufacturing processes fail to prevent product reliability, yield and quality issues, our product launch plans may be delayed, our financial results may be adversely impacted, and our reputation may be harmed.\nIn developing, commercializing and manufacturing Kodak\u2019s products and services, we must adequately address reliability, yield and other quality issues, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. Because Kodak\u2019s products are sophisticated and complicated to develop and commercialize with rapid advances in technologies, the occurrence of defects may increase, particularly with the introduction of new product lines. Unanticipated issues with product performance may delay product launch plans which could result in additional expenses, lost revenue and earnings. Although we have established internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from product quality issues, there can be no assurance that we will be able to eliminate or mitigate occurrences of these issues and associated liabilities. Product reliability, yield and quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand image, product quality issues can result in recalls, warranty, or other service obligations and litigation, and our reputation as a producer of high quality products could suffer, which could adversely affect our business as well as our financial results.\nOur ability to generate positive operating cash flows will be necessary for us to continue to operate our business.\nWhile Kodak has significantly reduced its rate of negative operating cash flow over the past two years, we continue to generate net negative operating cash flow. There is no assurance that Kodak will be able to generate positive cash flow from operations in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on Kodak\u2019s liquidity and financial position.\nContinued investment, capital needs, restructuring payments and servicing the Company\u2019s debt require a significant amount of cash and we may not be able to generate cash necessary to finance these activities, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nKodak\u2019s business may not generate cash flow in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay the principal of, or interest on our indebtedness, or to fund Kodak\u2019s other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, restructuring actions and other general corporate requirements.\nKodak\u2019s ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, litigation, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that:\n\u00b7\nKodak\u2019s businesses will generate sufficient cash flow from operations;\n\u00b7\nKodak will be able to repatriate or move cash to locations where and when it is needed;\n\u00b7\nKodak will meet all the conditions associated with making borrowings or issuing letters of credit under the Asset Based Revolving Credit Agreement (the \u201cABL Credit Agreement\u201d);\n\u00b7\nKodak will realize cost savings, earnings growth and operating improvements resulting from the execution of our business and restructuring plan;\n\u00b7\nKodak will not have to expend cash defending litigations regardless of the merits of any claims raised; or\n\u00b7\nfuture sources of funding will be available in amounts sufficient to enable funding of our liquidity needs.\nIf we cannot fund our liquidity needs, we will have to take actions, such as reducing or delaying capital expenditures, product development efforts, strategic acquisitions, and investments and alliances; selling additional assets; restructuring or refinancing the Company\u2019s debt; or seeking additional equity capital. Such actions could increase the Company\u2019s debt, negatively impact customer confidence in our ability to provide products and services, reduce the Company\u2019s ability to raise additional capital and delay sustained profitability. We cannot assure you that any of these actions could, if necessary, be effected on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that they would permit us to meet the Company\u2019s scheduled debt service obligations. In addition, if we incur additional debt, the risks associated with the Company\u2019s substantial leverage, including the risk that we will be unable to service the Company\u2019s debt, generate cash flow sufficient to fund our liquidity needs, or maintain compliance with the covenants in our various credit facilities, could intensify.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to comply with the terms of our various credit facilities.\nA breach of any of the financial or other covenants contained in the Senior Secured First Lien Term Credit Agreement (the \u201cFirst Lien Term Credit Agreement\u201d), Senior Secured Second Lien Term Credit Agreement (the \u201cSecond Lien Term Credit Agreement\u201d, and together with the First Lien Term Credit Agreement, the \u201cTerm Credit Agreements\u201d) or the ABL Credit Agreement (and together with the Term Credit Agreements the \u201cCredit Agreements\u201d) could result in an event of default under these facilities. If any event of default occurs and we are not able to either cure it or obtain a waiver from the requisite lenders under each of these facilities, the administrative agent of each credit facility may, and at the request of the requisite lenders for that facility shall, declare all of our outstanding obligations under the applicable credit facility, together with accrued interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable and the agent under the ABL Credit Agreement may, and at the request of the requisite lenders shall, terminate the lenders\u2019 commitments under that facility and cease making further loans, and if applicable, each respective agent could institute foreclosure proceedings against our pledged assets. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our operations and our ability to satisfy our obligations as they come due.\nDue to the nature of the products we sell and Kodak\u2019s worldwide distribution, we are subject to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity costs that may adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.\nAs a result of Kodak\u2019s global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates, which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Exchange rates and interest rates in markets in which we do business tend to be volatile and, at times, our sales can be negatively impacted across all of the Company\u2019s segments depending upon the value of the U.S. dollar, the Euro and other major currencies. In addition, the Company\u2019s products contain aluminum, silver, petroleum based or other commodity based raw materials, the prices of which have been, and may continue to be, volatile. If the global economic situation remains uncertain or worsens, there could be further volatility in changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices, which could have negative effects on our revenue and earnings.\nWeakness or worsening of global economic conditions could adversely affect our financial performance and liquidity.\nThe global economic environment may adversely affect sales of our products, profitability and liquidity. Global financial markets have been experiencing volatility. Economic conditions could accelerate any decline in demand for products, which could also place pressure on our results of operations and liquidity. There is no guarantee that anticipated economic growth levels in markets that have experienced some economic strength will continue in the future, or that we will succeed in expanding sales in these markets. In addition, accounts receivable and past due accounts could increase due to a decline in our customers\u2019 ability to pay as a result of an economic downturn, and the Company\u2019s liquidity, including our ability to use credit lines, could be negatively impacted by failures of financial instrument counterparties, including banks and other financial institutions. If global economic weakness and tightness in the credit markets exist, worsen or are attenuated, the Company\u2019s profitability and related cash generation capability could be adversely affected and, therefore, affect the Company\u2019s ability to meet the Company\u2019s anticipated cash needs, impair the Company\u2019s liquidity or increase the Company\u2019s costs of borrowing.\nThe competitive pressures we face could harm Kodak\u2019s revenue, gross margins and market share.\nThe markets in which we do business are highly competitive with large, entrenched, and well financed industry participants, many of which are larger than us. In addition, we encounter aggressive price competition for many of our products and services from numerous companies globally. Any of our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately than we do; sell superior products and provide superior services or offer a broader variety of products and services; have the ability to produce or supply similar products and services at a lower cost; have better access to supplies and the ability to acquire supplies at a lower cost; develop stronger relationships with our suppliers or customers; or adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements than we do or have access to capital markets or other financing sources on more favorable terms than we can obtain. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully with our competitors. Finally, we may not be able to maintain our operating costs or prices at levels that would allow us to compete effectively. Kodak\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures. If our products, services and pricing are not sufficiently competitive with current and future competitors, we could also lose market share, adversely affecting our revenue and gross margins.\nAn inability to provide competitive financing arrangements to Kodak\u2019s customers or extension of credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates could adversely impact our revenue, profitability and financial position.\nThe competitive environment in which we operate may require us to facilitate or provide financing to our customers in order to win a contract. Customer financing arrangements may cover all or a portion of the purchase price for the Company\u2019s products and services. We may also assist customers in obtaining financing from banks and other sources. Our success may be dependent, in part, upon our ability to provide customer financing on competitive terms and on our customers\u2019 creditworthiness. Tightening of credit in the global financial markets can adversely affect the ability of Kodak\u2019s customers to obtain financing for significant purchases, which may result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for our products and services. If we are unable to provide competitive financing solutions to our customers or if we extend credit to customers whose creditworthiness deteriorates, our revenues, profitability and financial position could be adversely impacted.\nIf the U.K. Kodak Pension Plan Purchasing Parties (\u201cKPP Purchasing Parties\u201d) are not able to successfully operate the Personalized Imaging and Document Imaging Business (the \u201cPI/DI Business\u201d) acquired from the Company or meet their commitments under supply, service and transition services and other agreements entered into with the Company, the Company\u2019s brand, reputation and financial results could suffer.\nThe Amended and Restated Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement between Eastman Kodak Company, Qualex, Inc., Kodak (Near East), Inc., KPP Trustees Limited, as Trustee for the Kodak Pension Plan of the United Kingdom, and, solely for the purposes of Section 11.4, KPP Holdco Limited, dated August 30, 2013 (\u201cAmended SAPA\u201d) and certain related agreements permit the KPP Purchasing Parties to use the Kodak name and brand in its operations of the PI/DI Business on a going-forward basis. If the KPP Purchasing Parties are not successful in the operation of the PI/DI Business, the Company\u2019s brand image and reputation as a producer of high quality products could be harmed, which could affect our financial results or operations. In addition, in connection with the closing under the Amended SAPA, on the Effective Date, the Company entered into certain supply and transition services agreements with the KPP Purchasing Parties under which the KPP Purchasing Parties are purchasing supplies and services from the Company. The inability of the KPP Purchasing Parties to make payments as they are due under the supply, service and transition service agreements could negatively affect our financial results. Further, with respect to a certain jurisdiction for which a deferred closing is expected to occur pursuant to the Amended SAPA in 2015, certain factors may delay the closing from occurring on the expected date, which could result in costs or operational impacts to Kodak.\nIf we cannot attract, retain and motivate key management and other key employees, Kodak\u2019s revenue and earnings could be harmed.\nIn order for us to be successful, we must continue to attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including technical, managerial, marketing, sales, research and support positions. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, research and engineering professionals, and qualified sales representatives, particularly in Kodak\u2019s targeted growth markets, are critical to our future. We may be unable to attract and retain highly qualified management and employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract and retain qualified individuals, key leaders, executives and employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets, which could adversely affect our business.\nIf we cannot effectively anticipate technology trends and develop and market new products to respond to changing customer preferences, our revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected.\nWe are a technology company serving imaging for business markets, including packaging, micro 3D printing, graphic communications and enterprise services. Our success in these markets depends on our ability to offer differentiated solutions to capture market share and grow scale. To enable this, we must continually develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner to keep pace with technological developments and achieve customer acceptance. In addition, the services and products that we provide to customers may not or may no longer meet the needs of our customers as the business models of our customers evolve. Our customers may decide to outsource their imaging needs or may purchase imaging services and needs from other suppliers. In addition, it is difficult to predict successfully the products and services our customers will demand. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to changes in customer preferences, expectations and needs. If we do not timely assess and respond to changing customer expectations, preferences and needs, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe must also effectively communicate to our customers, investors, and other key stakeholders our new business model and successfully position our products for the markets we serve. If we are unable to anticipate new technology trends, develop improvements to the Company\u2019s current technology to address changing customer preferences, and effectively communicate our businesses, products, and the markets we serve, our revenue, earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected.\nWe have outsourced a significant portion of Kodak\u2019s overall worldwide manufacturing, logistics and back office operations and face the risks associated with reliance on third party suppliers.\nWe have outsourced a significant portion of our overall worldwide manufacturing, logistics, customer support and administrative operations to third parties. To the extent that we rely on third party service providers, we face the risk that those third parties may not be able to:\n\u00b7\ndevelop manufacturing methods appropriate for the Company\u2019s products;\n\u00b7\nmaintain an adequate control environment;\n\u00b7\nquickly respond to changes in customer demand for the Company\u2019s products;\n\u00b7\nobtain supplies and materials necessary for the manufacturing process; or\n\u00b7\nmitigate the impact of labor shortages and/or disruptions.\nFurther, even if Kodak honors its payment and other obligations to its key suppliers of products, components and services, such suppliers may choose to unilaterally withhold products, components or services, or demand changes in payment terms. In addition, we may experience shortages in supply and disruptions in service as a result of unexpected demand, transportation and logistical limitations, and/or disruptions or production difficulties at our suppliers such as disruptions due to fires, other natural disasters or events outside of a supplier\u2019s control. In addition, disruptions could result from a reduction in the number of our suppliers due to their own financial difficulties or a reduction in the products offered by such suppliers. As a result of the loss of any supplier, or a substantial decrease in the availability of products from our suppliers, we may be unable to meet our customer commitments, our costs could be higher than planned, and our cash flows and the reliability of the Company\u2019s products could be negatively impacted. Kodak will vigorously enforce its contractual rights under such circumstances, but there is no guarantee we will be successful in preventing or mitigating the effects of unilateral actions by our suppliers. Other supplier problems that we could face include electronic component shortages, excess supply, risks related to the duration and termination of Kodak\u2019s contracts with suppliers for components and materials and risks related to dependency on single source suppliers on favorable terms or at all. The realization of any of these risks should alternative third party relationships not be established, could cause interruptions in supply or increases in costs that might result in Kodak\u2019s inability to meet customer demand for our products, damage to our relationships with Kodak\u2019s customers, and reduced market share, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.\nOur worldwide operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, cyber-attacks, terrorism, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics, political or economic instability, and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. In addition, some areas, including parts of the east and west coasts of the United States, have previously experienced, and may experience in the future, major power shortages and blackouts. These blackouts could cause disruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors and resellers, or customers. We have operations including research and development facilities in geographically disparate locations, such as Israel, Japan, China and Canada. The impact of these risks is greater in areas where products are manufactured at a sole or limited number of location(s), and where the sourcing of materials is limited to a sole or limited base of suppliers, since any material interruption in operations in such locations or suppliers could impact our ability to provide a particular product or service for a period of time. These events could seriously harm our revenue and financial condition, and increase our costs and expenses.\nIf we cannot protect the intellectual property rights on which the Company\u2019s business depends, or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights, our revenue, earnings, expenses and liquidity may be adversely impacted.\nA key differentiator for Kodak in many of our businesses is our technological advantage over competitors\u2019 products and solutions. Our technological advantage is supported by Kodak\u2019s intellectual property rights. Patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries, and non-disclosure, confidentiality and other types of agreements with Kodak\u2019s employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, may not be effective in establishing, maintaining and enforcing Kodak\u2019s intellectual property rights. Any of Kodak\u2019s direct or indirect intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect Kodak\u2019s proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third party copying, infringement or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Also, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry, much of Kodak\u2019s business and many of Kodak\u2019s products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms.\nWe have made substantial investments in new, proprietary technologies and have filed patent applications and obtained patents to protect Kodak\u2019s intellectual property rights in these technologies as well as the interests of Kodak\u2019s licensees. There can be no assurance that Kodak\u2019s patent applications will be approved, that any patents issued will adequately protect Kodak\u2019s intellectual property or that such patents will not be challenged by third parties.\nIn addition, third parties may claim that Kodak\u2019s customers, licensees or other parties indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to block or limit our access to certain markets. Additionally, in recent years, individuals and groups have begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies like ours. Even if we believe that the claims are without merit, these claims may have the following negative impacts on our business:\n\u00b7\nclaims can be time consuming and costly to defend and may distract management\u2019s attention and resources;\n\u00b7\nclaims of intellectual property infringement may require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products;\n\u00b7\neven if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations; and\n\u00b7\nif we cannot or do not license the infringed technology at all, license the technology on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, our revenue and earnings could be adversely impacted.\nFinally, we use open source software in connection with our products and services. Companies that incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. As a result, the Company could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost; any requirement to disclose the Company\u2019s source code or pay damages for breach of contract could be harmful to our business results of operations and financial condition.\nKodak\u2019s future pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs and required level of contributions could be unfavorably impacted by changes in actuarial assumptions, market performance of plan assets and obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, and cash flow.\nKodak has significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. The funded status of our U.S. and non U.S. defined benefit pension plans (and other postretirement benefit plans), and the related cost reflected in our financial statements, are affected by various factors that are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Key assumptions used to value these benefit obligations, funded status and expense recognition include the discount rate for future payment obligations, the long term expected rate of return on plan assets, salary growth, healthcare cost trend rates, mortality trends, and other economic and demographic factors. Significant differences in actual experience, or significant changes in future assumptions or obligations imposed by legislation or pension authorities could lead to a potential future need to contribute cash or assets to Kodak\u2019s plans in excess of currently estimated contributions and benefit payments and could have an adverse effect on Kodak\u2019s consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nIn past years, we have experienced increases in the costs of these defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligations as a result of macro-economic factors beyond our control, including increases in health care costs, declines in investment returns on pension plan assets and changes in discount rates and mortality rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities. At least some of these macro-economic factors may again put pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits. There can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure, including any as a result of new legislation, could reduce the profitability of our businesses.\nKodak\u2019s businesses experience seasonality of sales. Therefore, lower demand for Kodak\u2019s products or increases in costs during periods that are expected to be at peak in seasonality may have a pronounced negative effect on our results of operations.\nEquipment and consumables sales generally exhibit higher levels in the fourth quarter due to the seasonal nature of placements, resulting from customer or industry budgeting practices. As a result, a sequential quarter-to-quarter comparison is not a good indication of our performance or how we will perform in the future. In addition, adverse developments during what are expected to be peak periods in seasonality, such as lower-than-anticipated demand for Kodak\u2019s products, an internal systems failure, increases in materials costs, or failure of or performance problems with one of our key logistics, components supply, or manufacturing partners, could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results. Tight credit markets that limit capital investments or a weak economy that decreases print demand could negatively impact equipment or consumable sales. These external developments are often unpredictable and may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nIf we fail to manage distribution of Kodak\u2019s products and services properly, our revenue, gross margins and earnings could be adversely impacted.\nWe use a variety of different distribution methods to sell and deliver Kodak\u2019s products and services, including third party resellers and distributors and direct and indirect sales to both enterprise accounts and customers. Successfully managing the interaction of direct and indirect channels to various potential customer segments for our products and services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and costs, Kodak\u2019s failure to achieve the most advantageous balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue, gross margins and earnings. This has concentrated Kodak\u2019s credit and operational risk and could result in an adverse impact on our financial performance.\nKodak\u2019s future results could be harmed if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to expand sales in emerging markets.\nBecause we are seeking to expand our sales and number of customer relationships outside the United States, and specifically in emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, Kodak\u2019s business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, such as:\n\u00b7\nsupport of multiple languages;\n\u00b7\nrecruitment of sales and technical support personnel with the skills to design, manufacture, sell and supply products;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with governmental regulation of imports and exports, including obtaining required import or export approval for our products;\n\u00b7\ncomplexity of managing international operations;\n\u00b7\nexposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u00b7\ncommercial laws and business practices that may favor local competition;\n\u00b7\nmultiple, potentially conflicting, and changing governmental laws, regulations and practices, including differing export, import, tax, anti-corruption, anti-dumping, economic sanction, labor, and employment laws;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in collecting accounts receivable;\n\u00b7\nlimitations or restrictions on the repatriation of cash;\n\u00b7\nlimitations or reductions in protection of intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\ncomplications in logistics and distribution arrangements; and\n\u00b7\npolitical or economic instability.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to market and sell our products in all of Kodak\u2019s targeted markets. If our efforts are not successful, our business growth and results of operations could be harmed. As a global company, Kodak is subject to regulatory requirements and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and any alleged non-compliance with these requirements or laws could result in an adverse financial or reputational impact.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations and failure to comply with such laws and regulations or liabilities imposed as a result of such laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, including laws regarding the discharge of pollutants, including greenhouse gases, into the air and water, the need for environmental permits for certain operations, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites, the content of Kodak\u2019s products and the recycling and treatment and disposal of our products. If we do not comply with applicable laws and regulations in connection with the use and management of hazardous substances, or otherwise incur liabilities under such laws which in some instances can impose liability without regard to fault, then we could incur liability and/or could be prohibited or limited in the operation of certain facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The cost of complying with such laws, and costs associated with the cleanup of contaminated sites, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the Company, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the New York State Urban Development Corporation have entered into a settlement agreement concerning certain of the Company\u2019s historical environmental liabilities at Eastman Business Park through the establishment of a $49 million environmental remediation trust. Should historical liabilities exceed $49 million, New York State is responsible for payments of cost up to an additional $50 million. In the event the historical liabilities exceed $99 million, the Company will become liable for 50% of the portion above $99 million, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. The implementation date of the settlement agreement occurred on May 20, 2014. The settlement agreement includes a covenant not to sue from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Any uncertainties related to the Company\u2019s environmental obligations may impact our ability to further develop and transform Eastman Business Park.\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted by legal matters.\nWe have various contingencies that are not reflected on our balance sheet, including those arising as a result of being involved from time to time in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings concerning: commercial, customs, employment, and intellectual property matters, as well as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and other laws and regulations as discussed in the \u201cContingencies\u201d note in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs.\nRegulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d will require Kodak to incur additional expenses and could limit the supply and increase the cost of certain metals used in manufacturing Kodak\u2019s products.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of minerals originating from the conflict zones of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012, the SEC adopted rules requiring disclosure related to sourcing of specified minerals, known as \u201cconflict minerals,\u201d that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured by public companies. Kodak has developed a framework and management system consistent with the guidance issued by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and is currently performing due diligence on our supply chain. We expect to incur additional costs to comply with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the sources of the specified minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of any changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities, which may adversely affect our business. In addition, the number of suppliers who provide \u201cconflict-free\u201d minerals may be limited, which may make it difficult to satisfy customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so. Because Kodak\u2019s supply chain is complex, we may also not be sufficiently able to verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation.\nWe have determined that certain of our products contain such specified minerals, and we have developed a process to identify where such minerals originated. We filed our Conflict Minerals Disclosure report on June 2, 2014. As of the date of our conflict minerals report for the 2013 calendar year, we were unable to determine whether or not such minerals originate from the DRC or adjoining country.\nRisks Related to Our Level of Indebtedness and Access to Capital Markets\nOur substantial monetary obligations require that a portion of our cash flow be used to pay interest and fund other obligations rather than be invested in the business and could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations.\nOur indebtedness under our Credit Agreements and our other obligations could have important negative consequences to us and investors in our securities. These include the following:\n\u00b7\nwe may not be able to satisfy all of our obligations, including, but not limited to, our obligations under the Credit Agreements, which may cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration on other debt we may have incurred;\n\u00b7\nwe could have difficulties obtaining necessary financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, refinancing or other purposes;\n\u00b7\nwe will have to use a significant part of our cash flow to make payments on our debt and to satisfy the other obligations set forth above, which may reduce the capital available for operations and expansion; and\n\u00b7\nadverse economic or industry conditions may have more of a negative impact on us.\nWe cannot be sure that cash generated from our business will be as high as we expect or that our expenses will not be higher than we expect. Because a portion of our expenses are fixed in any given year, our operating cash flow margins are highly dependent on revenues, which are largely driven by customer demand. A lower amount of cash generated from our business or higher expenses than expected, when coupled with our debt obligations, could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations.\nOur access to the capital markets may be limited.\nBecause of our emergence from bankruptcy in 2013, our current non-investment grade credit rating, and/or general conditions in the financial and credit markets, our access to the capital markets may be limited. Moreover, the urgency of a capital-raising transaction may require us to pursue additional capital at an inopportune time. Our ability to obtain capital and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, including:\n\u00b7\ncovenants in our Credit Agreements;\n\u00b7\ninvestor confidence in us and the markets in which we operate;\n\u00b7\nour financial performance and the financial performance of our subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\nour levels of debt;\n\u00b7\nour ability to generate positive cash flow;\n\u00b7\nour requirements for posting collateral under various commercial agreements;\n\u00b7\nour credit ratings;\n\u00b7\nour cash flow;\n\u00b7\nour long-term business prospects; and\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic and capital market conditions, including the timing and magnitude of any market recovery.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining additional capital for these or other reasons. An inability to access capital may limit our ability to meet our operating needs and, as a result, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur current non-investment grade status may adversely impact our commercial operations, increase our liquidity requirements and increase the cost of refinancing opportunities. We may not have adequate liquidity to post required amounts of additional collateral.\nOur corporate family credit rating is currently below investment grade and we cannot assure you that our credit ratings will improve, or that they will not decline, in the future. Our credit ratings may affect the evaluation of our creditworthiness by trading counterparties and lenders, which could put us at a disadvantage to competitors with higher or investment grade ratings.\nIn carrying out our commercial business strategy, our current non-investment grade credit ratings have resulted and will likely continue to result in requirements that we either prepay obligations or post significant amounts of collateral to support our business. Additionally, our current non-investment grade credit ratings may limit our ability to obtain additional sources of liquidity, refinance our debt obligations or access the capital markets at the lower borrowing costs that would presumably be available to competitors with higher or investment grade ratings. Should our ratings continue at their current levels, or should our ratings be further downgraded, we would expect these negative effects to continue and, in the case of a downgrade, become more pronounced.", "PERMNO": 14276, "SIC": 3577, "TIC": "KODK"}
