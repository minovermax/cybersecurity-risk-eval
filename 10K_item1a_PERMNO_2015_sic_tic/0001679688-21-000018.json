{"cik": "1679688", "company": "Colony Capital, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us that we currently deem immaterial or that generally apply to all businesses also may adversely impact our business. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flow and liquidity could be materially adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business Strategy\nOur success depends on our ability to effectuate our digital transformation, including by monetizing legacy assets and simplifying our business operations.\nIn 2019, in connection with the acquisition of DBH, we announced our vision to establish the Company as a leading owner, operator and investment manager of digital infrastructure and real estate. In order to successfully execute on our digital transformation and achieve the anticipated benefits, we need to monetize our legacy assets to fund the growth in our digital business as well as to simplify our business operations. As of December 31, 2020, we had $11.9 billion in legacy assets, including $4.1 billion held for disposition, primarily related to the Company's pending exit of its hospitality business. If we are unable to consummate the pending hospitality exit transaction or otherwise monetize our legacy assets in the timeframe anticipated, our ability to grow our digital business and execute our digital transaction could be materially and adversely affected, which could in turn negatively impact the Company\u2019s stock price. There can be no assurance, however, regarding when or the extent to which we will be able to execute our digital transformation and realize any of the anticipated or other benefits we expect from the transformation, which may be difficult, unpredictable and subject to delays.\nOur investment strategy includes owning and/or managing a wide array of asset classes within the digital infrastructure and real estate industry; however, we may not successfully implement this investment strategy or ultimately realize any of the anticipated benefits of diversification.\nWe plan to invest in multiple asset classes within digital infrastructure and real estate, including but not limited to, data centers, cell towers, fiber networks and small cells, throughout the United States and the world. Although there can be no assurance that we will achieve this objective, we intend to build our digital infrastructure and real estate portfolio based on key attributes including, but not limited to, (i) market dynamics, (ii) asset quality, with a focus on hard-to-replicate assets, (iii) contract quality, with consideration given to contract duration, tenant quality, and tenant growth opportunities, (iv) management or platform potential, including through organic growth or acquisitions and (v) levels of leverage, based on the risk, duration and structure of cash flows of the underlying asset. However, we may not successfully implement our investment strategy. Even if we do fully achieve our investment goals, it is possible our multi-asset portfolio will not perform as well as a portfolio that is concentrated in a particular type of digital assets.\nThere are no limitations on the number or value of particular types of investments that we may make. We currently have multiple business segments in a variety of asset classes and industries; however, we expect our portfolio over time to consist predominantly of digital infrastructure and real estate assets and investment management businesses consistent with our digital transformation. Even though our investment strategy involves investing in multiple asset classes within digital infrastructure and real estate, we are not required to meet any diversification standards, including\ngeographic diversification standards. Therefore, our investments may become concentrated in type or geographic location. As of the date of this report, substantially all of the digital investments on the Company\u2019s balance sheet are data centers, primarily located in the United States. Our lack of diversification standards, along with our digital-focused investment strategy, could subject us to significant concentration risks with potentially adverse effects on our investment objectives.\nOur business vision is to be a leading owner, operator and investment manager of digital infrastructure and real estate, which may adversely impact our stock price and our intent to maintain our REIT qualification.\nOur business vision is to be a leading owner, operator and investment manager of digital infrastructure and real estate, which includes owning real estate assets on our balance sheet as well as operating an investment management platform. While we believe there are advantages to having both direct real estate investments and an investment management platform, these advantages may not be recognized by the investment community and, as a result, our stock price may be adversely affected. There are a very limited number of REITs pursuing an investment management growth strategy similar to our company, which may make it difficult for investors to value our overall business. If our company is perceived by investors as overly complex and difficult to analyze, our ability to raise capital and our stock price may be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, the pace of growth of our investment management business, coupled with the pace of our legacy asset monetizations, may ultimately conflict with our intent to maintain our REIT qualification for 2021. If we are unable to acquire sufficient qualifying REIT assets in 2021 to offset our anticipated legacy asset monetizations in 2021 and the growth in our investment management business, we may determine that it is not in our best interest to continue qualifying as a REIT, beginning in 2021. If we cease to qualify as a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income and generally would no longer be required to distribute any of the Company\u2019s net taxable income to our stockholders. While the maximum U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to corporations currently is 21%, the Biden administration is expected to propose material increases in the U.S. corporate tax rate. As a REIT, we are permitted to deduct any dividends paid on our stock from our REIT taxable income. While we currently do not pay a dividend on our common stock, we pay dividends on our approximately $1 billion of outstanding preferred stock. If we cease to qualify as a REIT, we would not be able to deduct any dividends (including the preferred dividends we currently pay) from our taxable income, which may result in higher income tax expense. A decision to de-REIT may not result in any of the anticipated benefits to our company and could negatively and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, returns to stockholders and the market price of our common stock.\nMoreover, our investment management business may involve risks not otherwise present with a direct investment in an investment vehicle\u2019s target assets, including, among others, investors failing to meet their capital commitment obligations, restrictions on our ability to transfer our interests in an investment vehicle, litigation risk between us and our investors, and exposure to potential liability in connection with our obligations as an investment vehicle\u2019s general partner/manager.\nPandemics or disease outbreaks, such as the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, have and the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to continue to, significantly disrupt, and may materially adversely impact, our business, financial condition and ability to execute on our business objectives.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have, and another pandemic in the future could have, repercussions across regional and global economies and financial markets. The outbreak of COVID-19, which first surfaced in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, has significantly adversely impacted global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The impact of the pandemic has been rapidly evolving and, as the number of COVID-19 cases increased, many countries, including the United States, reacted by instituting quarantines, restricting and banning travel or transportation, mandating business and school closures, limiting size of gatherings and canceling sporting, business and other events and conferences. While in May 2020, some parts of the United States had begun to ease the lockdown restrictions and allow businesses to reopen, a resurgence of COVID-19 cases towards the end of 2020 and into 2021 caused many U.S. states to re-institute such restrictions and business closure mandates. It is unknown when easing of these lockdowns and reopening will occur even as COVID-19 vaccines become available across the United States.\nWhile we continue our digital transformation, a significant portion of our assets consist of, and our revenues are derived from, real estate investments, including wellness infrastructure and hospitality assets. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted states and cities where we and our tenants operate our and their respective wellness infrastructure, hospitality and other businesses and where our properties are located. The preventative measures taken to alleviate the public health crisis, including significant restrictions on travel between the United States and specific countries, and \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d or \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders issued by local, state and federal authorities, has significantly disrupted global\ntravel and supply chains, and has adversely impacted global commercial activity across many industries, including in particular the travel, group meeting and conference, lodging and hospitality industries, and has disrupted, and is anticipated to further disrupt, operations and businesses in the wellness infrastructure industries, as discussed further below.\nThe occupancy rates of and revenues generated by our hospitality properties depends on the ability and willingness of guests to travel to our hotels. The spread of COVID-19 has not only decreased guests\u2019 willingness to travel, but also prevented guests from traveling to visit or stay at our hotels as a result of federal travel, social distancing or mandated \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d or \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders and even as such orders have begun to be lifted in the United States, demand for travel has and is expected to continue to be adversely impacted. Similarly, some tenants in our medical office buildings within our wellness infrastructure portfolio have and may continue to seek flexible payment terms or concessions from us for paying lease charges as a result of such restrictions. In addition, COVID-19 has impacted occupancy at our wellness infrastructure properties, as inquiries, tours and move-ins have all declined.\nIn addition, COVID-19 has had an adverse impact on the business and financial condition of publicly-traded mortgage REITs, including CLNC, the Company\u2019s managed mortgage REIT, in which it owns an approximate 36% interest. The borrowers of CLNC\u2019s real estate debt investments, including in the office, industrial, multifamily and hotel industries, have and will continue to be affected to the extent that COVID-19\u2019s persistence reduces occupancy, increases the cost of operation, limits hours or necessitates the closure of the properties collateralizing such debt investments. In addition, governmental measures, such as quarantines, states of emergencies, restrictions on travel, stay-at-home orders, and other measures taken to curb the spread of the COVID-19 may negatively impact the ability of CLNC\u2019s borrowers or tenants to continue to obtain necessary goods and services or provide adequate staffing, which may also adversely affect CLNC's loan investments and operating results. Many mortgage REITs suspended dividends to stockholders beginning in the second quarter 2020. In April 2020, CLNC announced that to conserve available liquidity, it would suspend its monthly stock dividend beginning with the monthly period ending April 30, 2020. On February 24, 2021, CLNC announced that it will pay a quarterly dividend for the quarter ending March 31, 2021, and expects to continue quarterly cash dividends thereafter. However, any dividends declared by CLNC are subject to the approval of CLNC's majority independent board and dependent upon a variety of factors. There can be no assurance that CLNC will continue paying its dividend as anticipated or at all. In addition, the Company\u2019s Core FFO is directly impacted by CLNC\u2019s performance as a result of the Company's ownership interest in CLNC and, to the extent CLNC continues to experience operational challenges as a result of COVID-19, our Core FFO will similarly be adversely impacted.\nFurther, CLNC's stock price fell significantly in March and April 2020 due to the significant volatility in equity markets resulting from COVID-19. Along with other publicly traded mortgage REITs, CLNC has experienced a rebound in its stock price during the third quarter 2020 and into 2021, but its stock continues to experience volatility and trade below pre-COVID-19 levels. With increasing uncertainty over the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the timeline for a recovery in the U.S economy, the Company recognized an $275 million other-than-temporary impairment on its CLNC investment in the second quarter 2020. The foregoing impairment was in addition to the $228 million other-than-temporary impairment on its CLNC investment recognized in the second quarter 2019. At December 31, 2020, the carrying value of our CLNC investment was $385 million, or $8.04 per share, while the trading price of CLNC\u2019s stock was $7.50 per share. As of February 22, 2021, the trading price of CLNC\u2019s stock was $8.71 per share. If the trading price of CLNC's class A common stock were to suffer further declines, to levels below our current carrying value for a prolonged period of time, as a result of COVID-19 or otherwise, an additional other-than-temporary impairment may be recognized in the future.\nThe difficult market and economic conditions created by COVID-19 have adversely impacted, and are expected to continue to adversely impact, our ability to effectuate our business objectives and strategies. A key component of our business strategy is to monetize certain non-digital, non-core assets in our other equity & debt segment. Many experts predict that the outbreak will trigger, or may have already triggered, a prolonged period of global economic slowdown or a global recession. A sustained downturn in the U.S. economy could negatively impact our ability to consummate asset monetizations within the timeframe and at the values previously anticipated. In addition, the ability to raise capital for our current or anticipated digital-focused investment vehicles may be delayed or adversely impacted by the market and economic conditions which could prevent us from executing our digital pivot and growing our digital business.\nThe inability to consummate asset monetizations has affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our liquidity and ability to meet our debt obligations or pay dividends to stockholders. For example, in May 2020, we announced the suspension of our common stock dividend for the second quarter of 2020 as the Company's board of directors and management believe it is prudent to conserve cash during the current period of uncertainty. In addition, in connection with the June 2020 amendment to the Company\u2019s corporate credit facility, we are prohibited from, among other things, paying dividends, other than (i) paying dividends to maintain the Company\u2019s REIT status, (ii) reducing the payment of income taxes and (iii) paying dividends on the Company\u2019s preferred stock. As a result, for the term of the corporate credit facility,\nthe Company is prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock, subject to certain limited exceptions. Nonetheless, all permissible distributions are made at the discretion of the Company's board of directors in accordance with Maryland law and depend on our financial condition; debt and equity capital available to us; our expectations for future capital requirements and operating performance; restrictive covenants in our financial or other contractual arrangements, including those in our corporate credit facility; maintenance of our REIT qualification; restrictions under Maryland law; and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time.\nAs a result of these and other factors, we expect our cash flows generated by our real estate investments, particularly in the hospitality and wellness infrastructure industries, to continue to be negatively impacted. Because a substantial portion of our income is derived from these businesses as well as our proceeds from asset monetizations, our business, income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects and ability to service our debt obligations and our ability to pay dividends and other distributions to our stockholders has been and will continue to be adversely affected if revenues at our hotel and wellness infrastructure properties continue to decline or we are unable to complete certain asset monetizations.\nIn addition, as COVID-19 has demonstrated the global economy's dependence on digital infrastructure and real estate, the Company has determined to accelerate its shift to a digitally-focused strategy. In doing so, the Company may accelerate the disposition of its legacy assets and portfolios and continue to focus on the growth of the Company's investment management business focused on digital infrastructure and real estate. This transition may be inconsistent with the Company's status as a REIT. For example, in September 2020, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell five of the six hotel portfolios in its Hospitality segment and its 55.6% interest in the THL Hotel Portfolio in the Other segment. While the Company will remain a REIT through 2020, in light of its strategy to accelerate the digital transformation, the Company will continue to evaluate whether to maintain REIT status beyond 2020. If the Company ceases to qualify as a REIT, we could be subject to the risks described under \u201cRisk Factors Related to our Business Strategy - Our business vision is to be a leading owner, operator and investment manager of digital infrastructure and real estate, which may adversely impact our stock price and our intent to maintain our REIT qualification\u201d above.\nFurthermore, our corporate credit facility requires us to maintain various financial covenants, including minimum tangible net worth, liquidity levels and financial ratios. Our corporate credit facility also requires us to maintain the Company\u2019s REIT status. The June 2020 amendment to our corporate credit facility, among other things, modified certain financial covenants and reduced the aggregate amount of revolving commitments available under the corporate credit facility. Notwithstanding such amendment, based on the decline in performance in our hotel and wellness infrastructure portfolios we are currently experiencing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and given the limited visibility to the future recovery of demand in the hospitality industry, there is a range of possible outcomes which may result in a breach of certain financial covenants prior to the current extended maturity of July 2021. In addition, because we exercised our initial extension option on the corporate credit facility, the aggregate amount of revolving commitments available under the corporate credit facility will be reduced to $400 million on March 31, 2021. To the extent that we are unable to effectuate asset monetizations in our Other segment as discussed above, we may be forced to allocate capital to repaying any outstanding balance on the corporate credit facility (either at the initial maturity, in connection with an extension on March 31, 2021, or the final maturity) that otherwise may have been used to invest in and grow the Company's digital infrastructure and real estate business. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could materially and adversely impact our liquidity and business operations.\nAdditionally, we have significant non-recourse mortgage debt in the Hospitality, Wellness Infrastructure and Other segments, as discussed further below. During 2020, in connection with payment defaults and/or covenant breaches, we executed various forbearance and other debt modification agreements with respect to the majority of such non-recourse mortgage debt. However, our efforts to obtain forbearances or debt modifications were not all successful. For example, as of the date of this report and as further described below, we have consensually transferred certain wellness infrastructure assets to lenders in exchange for a release of $158 million in borrowings secured by such assets, and the Inland Hotel Portfolio is in receivership. In addition, since October 2020, we have made approximately $28 million in aggregate payments to cure defaults and/or maintain debt compliance on a certain hospitality portfolio where we were not able to successfully complete a modification of the associated debt. We expect that a portion of these payments will be returned to us, either in connection with the pending hospitality disposition transaction or as a result of the provisions of the associated loan agreement; however, there can be no assurances that any of these funds will be returned as anticipated. Further, there can be no assurances that any forbearances or debt modifications obtained will result in any of the anticipated benefits. As of the date of this report, $3.5 billion of non-recourse mortgage debt on our hospitality properties is subject to cash flow sweeps. In addition, as of the date of this report, approximately $213 million in non-recourse mortgage debt in our Other and Wellness Infrastructure segments is in default and we expect to convey the mortgaged assets to the lenders via foreclosure or otherwise. Moreover, we have entered into customary non-recourse carve-out guarantees, which provide for these otherwise non-recourse borrowings to become partially or fully recourse\nagainst certain of the Company's affiliates in connection with certain limited trigger or \"bad boy\" events. Although we believe that \u201cbad boy\u201d carve-out guaranties are not guaranties of payment in the event of foreclosure or other actions of the foreclosing lender that are beyond the borrower\u2019s control, some lenders in the real estate industry have recently sought to make claims for payment under such guaranties. In the event such a claim were made against us under a \u201cbad boy\u201d carve-out guaranty, following foreclosure on mortgages or related loans, and such claim were successful, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic, or a future pandemic, could have material and adverse effects on our business, income, cash flow, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects and ability to service our debt obligations and has, and may continue to have, a material and adverse effect on our ability to pay dividends and other distributions to our stockholders due to, among other factors:\n\u2022difficulty accessing debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all, and a severe disruption and instability in the global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions may affect our access to capital necessary to fund business operations or address maturing liabilities on a timely basis and our tenants/borrowers\u2019 abilities to fund their business operations and meet their obligations to us;\n\u2022difficulty raising capital and attracting investors at our current and any future managed investment vehicles due to the volatility and instability in global financial markets may constrain the success of our managed investment vehicles and consequently our ability to sustain and grow our investment management business;\n\u2022the financial impact has and could continue to negatively impact our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders or could result in a determination to reduce the size of one or more dividends, such as is the case with (i) our decision to suspend the dividend on our common stock beginning the second quarter of 2020 and (ii) certain restrictions on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock pursuant to the recent amendment to our corporate credit facility;\n\u2022the financial impact could negatively impact our future compliance with financial covenants of our corporate credit facility and other debt agreements and could result in a default and potentially an acceleration of indebtedness, which non-compliance could also negatively impact our ability to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility or otherwise pay dividends to our stockholders;\n\u2022the worsening of estimated future cash flows due to a change in our plans, policies, or views of market and economic conditions as it relates to one or more of our adversely impacted properties could result in fair value decreases and the recognition of substantial impairment charges imposed on our assets;\n\u2022the credit quality of our tenants/borrowers could be negatively impacted and we may significantly increase our allowance for doubtful accounts;\n\u2022a general decline in business activity and demand for real estate transactions could adversely affect our ability or desire to grow our digital business or dispose of non-core assets as part of our asset monetization and digital pivot strategy;\n\u2022potential impairments on our real estate assets or ceasing to own real estate assets as a result of foreclosure or otherwise may impact our ability to maintain our REIT qualification or our exemption from the 1940 Act;\n\u2022CLNC's trading price and the impact on the carrying value of the Company's investment in CLNC, including whether the Company will recognize further other-than-temporary impairments on such CLNC investment in addition to those recognized in the second quarter 2020;\n\u2022we have and may continue to implement reductions in our workforce, which could adversely impact our ability to conduct our operations effectively;\n\u2022unanticipated costs and operating expenses and decreased anticipated revenue related to compliance with regulations, such as inability to litigate non-paying tenants, regulations requiring forbearance of rent payments in certain jurisdictions, additional expenses related to staff working remotely, requirements to provide employees with additional mandatory paid time off and increased expenses related to sanitation measures performed at each of our properties, as well as additional expenses incurred to protect the welfare of our employees, such as expanded access to health services;\n\u2022our level of dependence on the Internet, stemming from employees working remotely, and increases in malware campaigns and phishing attacks preying on the uncertainties surrounding COVID-19, which may increase our vulnerability to cyber attacks and cause disruptions to our internal control procedures;\n\u2022increased risk of litigation, particularly with respect to our wellness infrastructure properties, related to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022we, and in particular the success of our pivot to a digital infrastructure and real estate focused strategy, depend, to a significant extent, upon the efforts of our senior management team, including DBH\u2019s key personnel. If one or more members of our senior management team or the DBH team become sick with COVID-19, the loss of services of such member could adversely affect our business;\n\u2022the potential negative impact on the health of our personnel, particularly if a significant number of them are impacted, could result in a deterioration in our ability to ensure business continuity during a disruption; and\n\u2022the continued severity, duration, transmission rate and geographic spread of COVID-19 in the United States and elsewhere, the speed of the vaccine roll-out, effectiveness and willingness of people to take COVID-19 vaccines, the duration of associated immunity and their efficacy against emerging variants of COVID-19, the extent and effectiveness of other containment measures taken.\nMoreover, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate many of the risks described in this Annual Report.\nRisks Related to Our Hospitality Business. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the hospitality industry are unprecedented with global demand for lodging drastically reduced and occupancy levels reaching historic lows during the second quarter 2020. Many hotels have had to temporarily suspend operations or operate at reduced levels. As of the date of this report, all of our hotel properties remain open but are operating at reduced levels; however, we may determine or be required to temporarily suspend the operations at hotels in the future as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, in order to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency, hotel operators, including our hotel operators, have furloughed a substantial number of personnel and may, in the future, furlough more personnel. Such steps and other hotel personnel work schedule changes that may be made in the future to reduce costs for us or our hotel operators or franchisors, may have other consequences such as negatively impacting the reputation and demand for our hotels or operational challenges if our operators are unable to re-hire furloughed personnel, any of which could have an adverse impact on our ability to improve performance and operations at our hotels when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. In addition, if we are unable to access capital to make physical improvements to our hotels, the quality of our hotels may suffer, which may negatively impact demand for our hotels. Our third-party hotel managers may also face demands or requests from labor unions for additional compensation or other terms as a result of COVID-19 that could increase costs, and while we do not directly employ or manage employees at our hotels, we could incur costs in connection with such labor disputes or disruptions as our COVID-19 mitigation plans are implemented. We cannot predict when business levels will return to normalized levels when the effects of the pandemic subside. There also can be no guarantee that the demand for lodging, and consumer confidence in travel generally, will recover as quickly as other industries. As a result, the revenues from our hospitality portfolio have declined significantly and we expect this trend to continue.\nFurthermore, we have significant non-recourse borrowings outstanding on our hospitality properties (including the THL Hotel Portfolio). As of the date of this report, while none of such borrowings is currently in default, during 2020, nearly all of the $3.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of such borrowings was in default as a result of the failure to make interest payments in light of the impact COVID-19 has had on our hospitality properties. In addition, we have, and may in the future, receive notices of acceleration with respect to our defaulted borrowings. Further, we were not successful in our negotiations with the lender of the mortgage debt collateralized by a portfolio of 48 extended stay and select service hotel properties known as the Inland Hotel Portfolio and, during the third quarter 2020, a receiver was appointed at substantially all of the assets in the Inland Hotel Portfolio. During the period while the receiver is in place, we will no longer be in control of the operations of the Inland Hotel Portfolio even while still owning the assets.\nWe were able to restructure the majority of our non-recourse borrowings that were in default in 2020 in our hospitality portfolio in connection with COVID-19, either by executing forbearance agreements permitting us not to make interest payments for a specified period of time or entering into other loan modification agreements. However, for the borrowings that have been restructured or modified, or which are no longer in default, there can be no assurance that the cash flow generated from our hospitality portfolios will be sufficient to service such borrowings. As a result, we may need to pursue further restructurings of these borrowings or seek forbearance or other accommodations from our lenders. In connection with the same, we may be required to repay outstanding obligations, including penalties, prior to the stated maturity, be subject to cash flow sweeps or potentially have assets foreclosed upon, any of which may impact our ability to consummate the pending disposition of our hospitality business. As of the date of this report, an aggregate of $3.5 billion in our hospitality borrowings are subject to cash flow sweeps. During the fourth quarter 2020, there was a resurgence in COVID-19 cases in the United States, and although the number of new cases has begun to decline slightly since reaching peak levels in early January 2021, the number of new cases is remains at very high levels and such trend is anticipated to continue or worsen during the winter season. This resurgence has resulted, and could continue to result, in the re-\nimplementation or tightening of travel and stay-at-home restrictions. In addition, as previously disclosed, due to effects of seasonality, our hospitality properties typically generate lower revenues, operating income and cash flows in the first and fourth quarters of each year. During the fourth quarter 2020, due to the COVID-19 resurgence and seasonality, our hospitality properties experienced a decline in operating performance, and there can be no assurance that such performance will improve.\nWe have recognized significant impairments on hospitality properties (including the THL Hotel Portfolio). During the second and third quarters 2020, primarily related to assets which are anticipated to be divested or sold in the near term and have fair market values below their respective carrying values, we incurred an aggregate of $844 million in impairments on hospitality properties (including the THL Hotel Portfolio). To date, the Company has made payments totaling $28 million to lenders in order to cure certain defaults on the debt associated with a hotel portfolio. In connection with the pending disposition of our hospitality business, the seller has agreed, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to provide the Company with a purchase price credit for a portion of such funded amount; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will close the pending transaction or receive the anticipated purchase price credit. Moreover, depending on the status of ongoing negotiations with lenders, our anticipated hold periods for such assets and cash flow projections, among other factors, we may make additional payments to lenders or take additional impairments on hospitality properties.\nIn addition, we have agreed to guarantee or contribute to guaranteed payments of franchise fees and marketing fees to our hotel franchisors. In certain instances, such guarantee or contribution agreements may also include an obligation to pay liquidated damages to the hotel franchisor on an early termination of the applicable franchise agreement. In the event that a lender forecloses on our hospitality properties (including in the case of the Inland Hotel Portfolio which is currently in receivership), we may not be released from these payment guarantees or liquidated damages obligations and we may not have any control over whether a franchise agreement is terminated. In the case of the Inland Hotel Portfolio, we have received termination notices with respect to franchise agreements for hotels within the portfolio where the receiver has entered into a new franchise agreement with the applicable franchisor directly. We have not received any claims for liquidated damages from any such applicable franchisor of the terminated franchise agreement; however, there can be no assurances that liquidated damages will not be sought in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Wellness Infrastructure Business. We anticipate that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will vary by asset class within our wellness infrastructure portfolio. Many of the tenants in our medical office buildings suspended non-essential activities, and accordingly sought rent relief. In our senior housing and skilled nursing facilities, occupancy, which is the primary driver of revenues, has declined and may continue to decline during the pandemic as limitations on admissions and fewer inquiries and tours have caused a significant reduction in move-ins, while COVID-19 at the same time increases the risk of resident illness and move-outs. In addition, operating costs at our senior housing and skilled nursing facilities have increased to secure adequate staffing and personal protective equipment. We do not know to what extent, if any, federal relief programs may alleviate these concerns. We will be directly impacted by these factors in our RIDEA assets, or indirectly impacted in our net leased assets as these factors influence our tenants\u2019 ability and willingness to pay rent. We may be forced to restructure tenants\u2019 long-term lease obligations or suffer adverse consequences from the bankruptcy, insolvency or financial deterioration of one or more of our tenants, operators, borrowers or managers. As a result, we expect a significant decline in revenues, net operating income and cash flow generated by operations from our wellness infrastructure portfolio.\nWe have significant non-recourse borrowings outstanding on our wellness infrastructure properties. As of the date of this report, we have conveyed to an affiliate of our lender a portfolio of 36 assets in a consensual transfer to obtain a release on $158 million in aggregate principal amount in borrowings (as discussed above) and have another $45 million in aggregate principal amount of such borrowings in default. As the impact of COVID-19 continues to influence performance at our wellness infrastructure properties, we may experience additional defaults and may be subject to cash flow sweeps. Any such defaults will negatively impact our liquidity and may increase our risk of loss associated with our wellness infrastructure properties. We have entered into forbearance agreements suspending debt service payments for a limited period of time for certain portfolios, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, and are in active discussions with other lenders, where necessary, regarding deferral of payment obligations and forbearance/waiver of non-payments defaults for failure to satisfy certain financial or other covenants. However, if COVID-19 continues to impact performance and we are unable to obtain accommodations from our lenders, we may be required to repay outstanding obligations, including penalties, prior to the stated maturity, or potentially have assets foreclosed upon.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. We may also be named as defendants in lawsuits arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of our tenants and operators for which such tenants and operators have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless. We may be subject to increased risk of litigation and liability claims as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and our operating partners\u2019 response efforts. Some of these claims may result in large damage awards, which may not be sufficiently covered by insurance or indemnity\nobligations. Any such litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nGiven the ongoing nature of the outbreak, at this time we cannot reasonably estimate the magnitude of the ultimate impact that COVID-19 will have on our business, financial performance and operating results. We believe COVID-19\u2019s adverse impact on our business, financial performance and operating results will be significantly driven by a number of factors that we are unable to predict or control, including, for example: the severity and duration of the pandemic; the pandemic\u2019s impact on the U.S. and global economies; the timing, scope and effectiveness of additional governmental responses to the pandemic; the timing and speed of economic recovery, including the availability of a treatment or vaccination for COVID-19; and the negative impact on our fund investors, vendors and other business partners that may indirectly adversely affect us.\nRisks Related to Our Digital Business\nWe require capital in order to continue to operate and grow our business, and the failure to obtain such capital, either through the public or private markets or other third party sources of capital, would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to maintain our distributions to our stockholders.\nWe require capital to fund acquisitions and originations of our target investments, to fund our operations, including overhead costs, to fund distributions to our stockholders and to repay principal and interest on our borrowings. We expect to meet our capital requirements using cash on hand, cash flow generated from our operations and investment management activities, sale proceeds from non-core investments and principal and interest payments received from legacy debt investments. However, because of distribution requirements imposed on us to qualify as a REIT which generally requires that we distribute to our stockholders 90% of our taxable income and that we pay tax on any undistributed income, our ability to finance our growth must largely be funded by external sources of capital. As a result, we may have to rely on third party sources of capital, including public and private offerings of securities and debt financings.\nIn addition, the fee income generated from or expected to be generated from our current and future managed investment vehicles is driven, both directly and indirectly, by the ability to raise capital at such investment vehicles. Our ability to raise capital at our company, as well as at our current and future managed investment vehicles, through the public and private capital markets depends on a number of factors, including many that are outside our control, such as the general economic environment, the regulatory environment, competition in the marketplace, media attention and investor investment allocation preferences. Poor performance by, or negative publicity about, our Company, our strategy, our management or our managed companies could also make it more difficult for us or our managed investment vehicles to raise new capital. Investors in our managed companies may decline to invest in future companies we raise, and investors may withdraw their investments in our managed companies (subject to the terms of such managed company) as a result of poor performance or negative perceptions of our Company or our leadership. In addition, third party financing may not be available to us when needed, on favorable terms, or at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing to fund or grow our business, it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to acquire additional assets and make our debt service payments and our financial condition, results of operations and the ability to fund our distributions to our stockholders would be materially adversely affected.\nAdverse changes in general economic and political conditions could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is materially affected by general economic and political conditions in the United States and globally, and our ability to manage our exposure to these conditions may be very limited. These conditions and/or events can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the ability of our managed vehicles to raise or deploy capital, reducing the value or performance of our investments and the investments made by our managed vehicles and making it more difficult for us and our managed vehicles to realize value from existing investments. Adverse changes in market and economic conditions in the United States or the countries or regions in which we or our managed vehicles invest would likely have a negative impact on real estate values as well as spending and demand for digital and communications infrastructure and technology and, accordingly, our and our managed vehicle\u2019s financial performance, the market prices of our securities, and our ability to pay dividends.\nThe condition of the digital infrastructure and real estate markets in which we operate is cyclical and depends on the condition of the economy in the United States, Europe, China and elsewhere as a whole and to the perceptions of investors of the overall economic outlook. Rising interest rates, declining employment levels, declining demand for real estate, declining real estate values or periods of general economic slowdown or recession, increasing political instability or uncertainty, or the perception that any of these events may occur have negatively impacted the real estate market in the\npast and may in the future negatively impact our operating performance. In addition, the economic condition of each local market where we operate may depend on one or more key industries within that market, which, in turn, makes our business sensitive to the performance of those industries. Further, as we continue to build our investment portfolio in the digital infrastructure and real estate industries, we will become more dependent on demand for data center space, power and connectivity, which may be adversely affected in deteriorating global economic conditions.\nIn addition, political uncertainty may contribute to potential risks beyond our control, such as changes in governmental policy on a variety of matters including trade, healthcare, manufacturing, development and investment, the restructuring of trade agreements, and uncertainties associated with political gridlock. Any such changes in U.S. or international political conditions, or political uncertainty and instability, in the territories and countries where we or our tenants and customers operate could adversely affect our operating results, our business and the market price of our stock.\nWe have only a limited ability to change our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic or other conditions. Certain significant expenditures, such as debt service costs, real estate taxes, and operating and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when market conditions are poor. These factors impede us from responding quickly to changes in the performance of our investments and could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe digital infrastructure and real estate industry is highly competitive and such competition may materially and adversely affect our performance and ability to execute our strategy.\nThe digital infrastructure and real estate business is highly competitive based on a number of factors, including brand recognition, reputation and pricing pressure on the products and services offered by the companies in which we expect to invest. A reduction in the perceived quality of services and products offered, or if our competitors offer rental, leasing or similar rates at below market rates or below the rates charged by the companies in which we invest, the performance of the companies in which we invest could be adversely impacted and, as a result, our ability to raise third party capital in our current and future digital focused private equity funds could be adversely impacted. In the event that we are unable to grow our digital real estate infrastructure platform as a result of our poor performance or lack of available funding for our investments, our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects would be materially adversely affected.\nWe are also subject to significant competition for attractive investment opportunities from other digital investors, some of which have greater financial resources than us, including publicly-traded REITs, non-traded REITs, insurance companies, commercial and investment banking firms, private institutional funds, hedge funds, private equity funds and other investors. Some of our competitors and potential competitors have significant advantages over us, particularly as we continue our digital transformation, including greater name recognition, longer or more favorable operating histories, pre-existing relationships with current or potential customers, significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources and more ready access to capital which allow them to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities. We may not be able to compete successfully for investments. In addition, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investments may increase. To the extent we pay higher prices for our target investments or acquire assets on less advantageous terms to us, or are required to do so in the future, due to increased competition, our returns may be lower and the value of our assets may not increase or may decrease significantly below the amount we paid for such assets. If such events occur, we may experience lower returns on our investments.\nOur operations in Europe and elsewhere expose our business to risks inherent in conducting business in foreign markets.\nA portion of our revenues are sourced from our foreign operations in Europe and elsewhere or other foreign markets. Accordingly, our firm-wide results of operations depend in part on our foreign operations. Conducting business abroad carries significant risks, including:\n\u2022our REIT tax status not being respected under foreign laws, in which case any income or gains from foreign sources could be subject to foreign taxes and withholding taxes;\n\u2022changes in real estate and other tax rates, the tax treatment of transaction structures and other changes in operating expenses in a particular country where we have an investment;\n\u2022restrictions and limitations relating to the repatriation of profits;\n\u2022complexity and costs of staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022the burden of complying with multiple and potentially conflicting laws;\n\u2022changes in relative interest rates;\n\u2022translation and transaction risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency and exchange rates;\n\u2022lack of uniform accounting standards (including availability of information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"));\n\u2022unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022the impact of different business cycles and economic instability;\n\u2022political instability and civil unrest;\n\u2022legal and logistical barriers to enforcing our contractual rights, including in perfecting our security interests, collecting accounts receivable, foreclosing on secured assets and protecting our interests as a creditor in bankruptcies in certain geographic regions;\n\u2022share ownership restrictions on foreign operations;\n\u2022compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, including sanctions laws, or anti-bribery laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d); and\n\u2022geographic, time zone, language and cultural differences between personnel in different areas of the world.\nEach of these risks might adversely affect our performance and impair our ability to make distributions to our stockholders required to qualify and remain qualified as a REIT. In addition, there is generally less publicly available information about foreign companies and a lack of uniform financial accounting standards and practices (including the availability of information in accordance with GAAP) which could impair our ability to analyze transactions and receive timely and accurate financial information from our investments necessary to meet our reporting obligations to financial institutions or governmental or regulatory agencies.\nConcerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency, given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Eurozone countries and in recent volatility in the value of the euro. These concerns could lead to the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more Eurozone countries, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations would be uncertain. Such uncertainty would extend to among other things, whether obligations previously expressed to be owed and payable in euros would be re-denominated in a new currency, what laws would govern and the courts of which country would have jurisdiction. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could materially adversely affect the value of our euro-denominated assets and obligations.\nIn addition, the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d) effective as of January 31, 2020, but with a transition period until the end of 2020. A Trade and Cooperation Agreement (\u201cTCA\u201d) was agreed upon by the EU and the U.K. on December 24, 2020, and ratified by the European Council and the U.K. Parliament ahead of the end of the transition period on December 31, 2020. While the TCA has provisions for how both parties will trade, live, and work with one another, financial services are not covered in any detail in the TCA. The nature of much of the future economic and political relationship between the EU and the United Kingdom remains uncertain, and there is no guarantee that both parties will be able to adhere to the terms of the deal effectively. The United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the EU has created political and economic uncertainty, particularly in the United Kingdom and the EU, and this uncertainty may last for years. Uncertainty about global or regional economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news, and declines in income or asset values, which could adversely affect the availability of financing, the business of our tenants, our business and our results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Digital Investment Management Business\nThe investment management business is intensely competitive.\nThe investment management business is intensely competitive, with competition based on a variety of factors, including investment performance, the quality of service provided to clients, brand recognition and business reputation. Our investment management business competes for clients, personnel and investment opportunities with a large number of private equity funds, specialized investment funds, hedge funds, corporate buyers, traditional investment managers, commercial banks, investment banks, other investment managers and other financial institutions, and we expect that competition will increase. Numerous factors serve to increase our competitive risks, some of which are outside of our control, including that:\n\u2022a number of our competitors have more personnel and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do;\n\u2022many of our competitors have raised, or are expected to raise, significant amounts of capital, and many of them have investment objectives similar to ours, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities and reduce the size and duration of pricing inefficiencies that we seek to exploit;\n\u2022some of our competitors (including strategic competitors) may have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to our managed companies, particularly our managed companies that directly use leverage or rely on debt financing of their portfolio companies to generate superior investment returns;\n\u2022some of our competitors have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments;\n\u2022our competitors may be able to achieve synergistic cost savings in respect of an investment that we cannot, which may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for an investment;\n\u2022there are relatively few barriers to entry impeding new funds, and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various lines of business, including major commercial and investment banks and other financial institutions, have resulted in increased competition;\n\u2022some investors may prefer to invest with an investment manager whose equity securities are not traded on a national securities exchange;\n\u2022some investors may prefer to pursue investments directly instead of investing through one of our managed companies;\n\u2022other industry participants will from time to time seek to recruit our investment professionals and other employees away from us; and\n\u2022other investment managers may offer more products and services than we do, have more diverse sources of revenue or be more adept at developing, marketing and managing new products and services than we are.\nWe may find it harder to raise capital in the REITs, private funds and other investment vehicles that we manage, and we may lose investment opportunities in the future, if we do not match the fees, structures and terms offered by competitors to their fund clients. Alternatively, we may experience decreased profitability, rates of return and increased risk of loss if we match the prices, structures and terms offered by competitors. This competitive pressure could adversely affect our ability to make successful investments and limit our ability to raise future managed investment vehicles, either of which would adversely impact our business, revenues, results of operations and cash flow.\nPoor performance of our current and future managed investment vehicles could cause a decline in our revenue, income and cash flow.\nThe fee arrangements we have with certain of our managed investment vehicles are based on the respective performance of such companies. As a result, poor performance or a decrease in value of assets under management of such managed companies (or any companies we may manage in the future with similar performance-based fees) would result in a reduction of our investment management and other fees, carried interest and/or other incentive fees and consequently cause our revenue, income and cash flow to decline. Further, to the extent that we have an investment in a managed investment vehicle, poor performance at such investment vehicle could cause us to suffer losses on such investments of our own capital.\nInvestors in our current or future managed investment vehicles may negotiate terms less favorable to us than those of investment vehicles we currently manage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn connection with sponsoring new managed investment vehicles or securing additional capital commitments in existing investment vehicles, we will negotiate terms for such investment vehicles and commitments from investors. In addition, we have agreed and may in the future agree to re-negotiate terms in the agreements with our investment vehicles due to performance of such investment vehicles or other market conditions. The outcome of such negotiations have and could in the future result in our agreement to terms that are materially less favorable to us economically than the existing terms of our investment vehicles or vehicles advised by our competitors. In addition, we have recorded and may in the future need to record impairments in the goodwill associated with such agreement as a result of amended economic terms in such agreements. For example, in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2019, we recognized impairments to our investment management goodwill of $387 million and $401 million, respectively, as a result of the loss of, or reductions in, management fees. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding such impairments. Further, we may also agree to terms that could restrict our ability to sponsor competing investment vehicles, require us to dispose of an investment within a certain period of time, restrict our ability to sell all or a portion of\nour position in a co-investment, increase our obligations as the manager or require us to take on additional potential liabilities. Agreement to terms that are materially less favorable to us could result in a decrease in our profitability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nValuation methodologies for certain assets in our managed institutional private funds can involve subjective judgments, and the fair value of assets established pursuant to such methodologies may be incorrect, which could result in the misstatement of performance and accrued performance fees of an institutional private fund.\nThere are often no readily ascertainable market prices for a substantial majority of illiquid investments of our managed institutional private funds. We determine the fair value of the investments of each of our institutional private funds at least quarterly based on the fair value guidelines set forth by GAAP. The fair value measurement accounting guidance establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework that ranks the observability of market inputs used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. The observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, the characteristics specific to the financial instrument and the state of the marketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices, or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets, will generally have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value.\nInvestments for which market prices are not observable include, but are not limited to, illiquid investments in operating companies, real estate, energy ventures and structured vehicles, and encompass all components of the capital structure, including equity, mezzanine, debt, preferred equity and derivative instruments such as options and warrants. Fair values of such investments are determined by reference to (1) the market approach (i.e., multiplying a key performance metric of the investee company or asset, such as earnings before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\"), by a relevant valuation multiple observed in the range of comparable public entities or transactions, adjusted by management as appropriate for differences between the investment and the referenced comparables), (2) the income approach (i.e., discounting projected future cash flows of the investee company or asset and/or capitalizing representative stabilized cash flows of the investee company or asset) and (3) other methodologies such as prices provided by reputable dealers or pricing services, option pricing models and replacement costs.\nThe determination of fair value using these methodologies takes into consideration a range of factors including but not limited to the price at which the investment was acquired, the nature of the investment, local market conditions, the multiples of comparable securities, current and projected operating performance and financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment. These valuation methodologies involve a significant degree of management judgment. For example, as to investments that we share with another sponsor, we may apply a different valuation methodology than the other sponsor does or derive a different value than the other sponsor has derived on the same investment, which could cause some investors to question our valuations.\nBecause there is significant uncertainty in the valuation of, or stability of the value of, illiquid investments, the fair values of such investments as reflected in an institutional private fund\u2019s net asset value do not necessarily reflect the prices that would be obtained by us on behalf of the institutional private fund when such investments are realized. Realizations at values significantly lower than the values at which investments have been reflected in prior institutional private fund net asset values would result in reduced earnings or losses for the applicable fund, the loss of potential carried interest and incentive fees and, in the case of our hedge funds, management fees. Changes in values attributed to investments from quarter to quarter may result in volatility in the net asset values and results of operations that we report from period to period. Also, a situation where asset values turn out to be materially different than values reflected in prior institutional fund net asset values could cause investors to lose confidence in us, which could in turn result in difficulty in raising additional institutional private funds.\nFurther, the SEC has highlighted valuation practices as one of its areas of focus in investment advisor examinations and has instituted enforcement actions against advisors for misleading investors about valuation. If the SEC were to investigate and find errors in our methodologies or procedures, we and/or members of our management could be subject to penalties and fines, which could harm our reputation and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe organization and management of our current and future investment vehicles may create conflicts of interest.\nWe currently manage, and may in the future manage, private funds, REITs and other investment vehicles that have investment and/or rate of return objectives similar to our own. Those entities may be in competition with us with respect to investment opportunities, potential purchasers, sellers and lessees of properties, and mortgage financing opportunities. We have agreed to implement certain procedures to help manage any perceived or actual conflicts among us and our managed investment vehicles, including the following:\n\u2022allocating investment opportunities based on numerous factors, including investment objectives, available cash, diversification/concentration, leverage policy, the size of the investment, tax, anticipated pipeline of suitable investments and fund life;\n\u2022all co-investment transactions with managed investment vehicles are subject to the approval of the independent directors of such investment vehicles that are publicly registered companies or previously approved in applicable company documentation, as the case may be; and\n\u2022investment allocations are reviewed at least annually by the chief compliance officer of our applicable registered investment adviser and/or the board of directors of the applicable investment vehicle that is a publicly registered company, as the case may be.\nIn addition, subject to compliance with the rules promulgated under the Investment Advisers Act, we have and may continue to allow a managed investment vehicle to enter into principal transactions with us or cross-transactions with other managed investment vehicles or strategic vehicles. For certain cross-transactions, we may receive a fee from, or increased fees from, the managed investment vehicle and conflicts may exist. If our interests and those of our managed companies are not aligned, we may face conflicts of interests that result in action or inaction that is detrimental to us, our managed investment vehicles, our strategic partnerships or our joint ventures.\nIn addition, in general, the DBH Portfolio Companies, including DataBank and Vantage SDC, and our Digital Colony funds have priority over us with respect to digital investment opportunities in the target asset classes and the jurisdictions in which we expect to invest. However, as a result of our acquisition of a controlling ownership interest in DataBank and Vantage SDC, we may be in a position to control whether DataBank or Vantage SDC, as applicable, accepts an investment allocation, which could result in conflicts of interest. Further, certain officers and senior management who make allocation decisions may have financial interests in a particular fund or managed investment vehicle, which may increase such conflicts of interest.\nAppropriately dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to deal appropriately with one or more potential or actual conflicts of interest. Regulatory scrutiny of, or litigation in connection with, conflicts of interest would have a material adverse effect on our reputation, which would materially adversely affect our business and our ability to raise capital in future managed companies.\nConflicts of interest may also arise in the allocation of fees and costs among our managed companies that we incur in connection with the management of their assets. This allocation sometimes requires us to exercise discretion and there is no guarantee that we will allocate these fees and costs appropriately.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of the Wafra strategic partnership.\nThe strategic partnership with Wafra in our Digital IM Business is expected to result in certain benefits to us, including, among others, providing us with liquidity to pursue strategic digital investments and grow our digital assets under management as well as enhancing our ability to accelerate our digital transformation. There can be no assurance, however, regarding when or the extent to which we will be able to realize these and any other benefits we expect from the transaction, which may be difficult, unpredictable and subject to delays.\nIn addition, pursuant to the strategic partnership documentation, Wafra has certain redemption rights which, if exercised, would require the Company to repurchase Wafra's equity investment, carried interest participation rights and warrants. Wafra's redemption rights are triggered upon the occurrence of certain events including key person or cause events under the governing documentation of certain Digital Colony investment vehicles and, for a limited period, upon Marc Ganzi, the Company's CEO and President, and Ben Jenkins, the Chairman and Chief Investment Officer of the Company's digital segment, ceasing to fulfill certain time and attention commitments to the Digital IM Business. If such redemption rights are exercised, Wafra will also have a redemption right with respect to any sponsor commitments previously made to the Company's funds and vehicles. No assurance can be given that such redemption events, if triggered, would arise at a time when the Company will have the cash on hand or other available liquidity (including availability under the Company's corporate credit facility) to satisfy the redemptions, which could result in the Company being forced to allocate capital away from other potential opportunities or uses that we would otherwise consider to be the most effective use of such capital.\nAdditionally, under certain circumstances following such time as our Digital IM Business comprises 90% or more of the Company\u2019s assets, we have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Wafra to facilitate the conversion of Wafra\u2019s equity investment into the Company's class A common stock. There can be no assurances that such conversion would occur or on what terms and conditions such conversion would occur, including whether such conversion, if it did occur in the future, would have any adverse impact on the Company, the Company\u2019s stock price, governance and other matters.\nIf any or all of the risks described above, including the risk that the redemption obligations are triggered, were to materialize, the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Digital Real Estate Business\nAny failure of our physical infrastructure or services could lead to significant costs and disruptions that could harm our business reputation and could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nOur digital real estate business depends on providing customers with highly reliable services, including with respect to power supply, physical security and maintenance of environmental conditions. We may fail to provide such service as a result of numerous factors, including mechanical failure, power outage, human error, physical or electronic security breaches, war, terrorism, fire, earthquake, hurricane, flood, climate change and other natural disasters, sabotage and vandalism.\nProblems at one or more of our data centers, towers or other digital infrastructure assets in which we expect to invest, whether or not within our control, could result in service interruptions or equipment damage. Substantially all of the customer leases associated with our digital assets include terms requiring us to meet certain service level commitments to such customers. Any failure to meet these or other commitments or any equipment damage in our data centers, including as a result of mechanical failure, power outage, human error or other reasons, could subject us to liability under our lease terms, including service level credits against customer rent payments, monetary damages, or, in certain cases of repeated failures, the right by the customer to terminate the lease. Service interruptions, equipment failures or security breaches may also expose us to additional legal liability, regulatory requirements, penalties and monetary damages and damage our brand and reputation, and could cause our customers to terminate or not renew their leases. In addition, we may be unable to attract new customers if we have a reputation for service disruptions, equipment failures or physical or electronic security breaches in our data centers or with regard to other digital infrastructure assets. Any such failures could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not control the operations of certain of our digital real estate assets and are therefore dependent on portfolio company management teams to successfully operate their businesses.\nOur data centers are typically operated by in place management teams at the portfolio companies which hold these assets and in which we own our interests or by third party management companies. While we have or expect to have various rights as an owner of the portfolio companies, we may have limited recourse under our management agreements or investment interest documentation if we believe that such in place management teams (who are not our employees) or third party management companies are not performing adequately. Failure by the in place management teams to adequately manage the risks associated with managing data centers could result in defaults under our borrowings and otherwise affect adversely our results of operations. Furthermore, if the portfolio companies or management companies experience any significant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties, such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe performance of our digital assets depends upon the demand for such assets.\nWe have determined to shift our strategy to focus on becoming a leading platform for digital infrastructure and real estate, which owns, manages, and/or operates across all major components of the digital ecosystem including data centers, cell towers, fiber networks and small cells. A reduction in the demand for these digital assets, power or connectivity will adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategy and our performance. Demand for digital assets is particularly susceptible to general economic slowdowns as well as adverse developments in the data center, Internet and data communications and broader technology industries. Any such slowdown or adverse development could lead to reduced corporate IT spending or reduced demand for data center space or towers. Reduced demand could also result from business relocations, including to metropolitan areas that we do not currently or expect to serve. Changes in industry practice or in technology could also reduce demand for the physical data center space or the tower assets we provide or expect to provide. In addition, our customers may choose to develop new data centers or expand their own existing data centers or consolidate into data centers that we do not own or operate, which could reduce demand for our newly developed data centers or result in the loss of one or more key customers. With respect to the tower assets we expect to own, demand for towers could be adversely impacted by changes in federal, state, local and foreign jurisdictions to the extent such regulations prohibiting the additions of new towers on potential communication sites. If we lose a customer or a tenant, we cannot assure you that we would be able to replace that customer at a competitive rate or at all. Mergers or consolidations of technology companies could reduce further the number of our customers/tenants and potential customers/tenants and make us more dependent on a more limited number of customers. If our customers merge with or are acquired by other entities that are not our customers, they may discontinue or reduce the use of our\ndata centers in the future. Our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow for distributions could be materially adversely affected as a result of any or all of these factors.\nWe expect certain of the leases we have with our customers to expire each year or are on a month-to-month basis, and to contain early termination provisions. If leases with our customers are not renewed on the same or more favorable terms or are terminated early by our customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be substantially harmed.\nCustomers for our data centers and towers we own or expect to own may not renew their leases upon expiration. This risk is increased to the extent our customer leases expire on an annual basis. Upon expiration, our customers may elect not to renew their leases or renew their leases at lower rates, for less space, for fewer services or for shorter terms. If we are unable to successfully renew or continue our customer leases on the same or more favorable terms or subsequently re-lease available data center space when such leases expire, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, certain of our leases may contain early termination provisions that allow our customers to reduce the term of their leases subject to payment of an early termination charge that is often a specified portion of the remaining rent payable on such leases. The exercise by customers of early termination options could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe infrastructure of the data centers that we own or expect to own may become obsolete, which could materially and adversely impact our revenue and operations.\nData centers require infrastructure, such as power and cooling systems, that is difficult and costly to upgrade. If the infrastructure in our data centers becomes obsolete due to the development of new server technologies, we may need to upgrade or change the systems in our data centers in order to keep our existing tenants or attract new tenants. We may not be able to effectively or efficiently upgrade or change our data center infrastructure, and may incur substantial costs in doing so. Any inability to upgrade or change our data center infrastructure in connection with technological developments may result in the loss of tenants and adversely impact our ability to attract new tenants, all of which could materially and adversely impact our revenues and operations.\nDigital infrastructure and real estate investments are subject to substantial government regulation.\nDigital infrastructure and real estate investments are subject to substantial government regulation related to the acquisition and operation of such investments. Failure to comply with applicable government regulations or the inability to obtain or maintain any required government permits, licenses, concessions, leases or contracts needed to operate the digital infrastructure and real estate investments we own or expect to own, could adversely affect our ability to achieve our investment objectives. In addition, governments often have considerable discretion to implement regulations that could affect the business of digital infrastructure and real estate investments in we invest or expect to invest. Changes in existing regulations could be costly for us to comply with, and may delay or prevent the operation of our assets, all of which could adversely impact the performance of our investments.\nWe often pursue investment opportunities that involve business, regulatory, legal or other complexities and the failure to successfully manage such risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe often pursue unusually complex investment opportunities involving substantial business, regulatory or legal complexity that would deter other investors. Our tolerance for complexity presents risks, as such transactions can be more difficult, expensive and time-consuming to finance and execute, it can be more difficult to manage or realize value from the assets acquired in such transactions, and such transactions sometimes entail a higher level of regulatory scrutiny or a greater risk of contingent liabilities. Failure to successfully manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMany of our investments may be illiquid and we may not be able to vary our investment portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions.\nEquity investments in real estate, as well as investments in mortgage-related assets, are relatively illiquid. As a result, our ability to vary our investment portfolio promptly in response to changed economic and other conditions is limited, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and our ability to pay dividends and make distributions. In addition, the liquidity of our investments may also be impacted by, among other things, restrictions on a REIT\u2019s ability to dispose of properties that are not applicable to other types of real estate companies, other legal or contractual restrictions, the lack of available financing for assets, the absence of a willing buyer or an established market and turbulent market conditions. The illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments at advantageous times or in a timely manner if the need or desire arises, including, if necessary, to maintain our status as a REIT or to maintain our exemption from the 1940 Act. If we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly,\nwe may realize significantly less than the value at which we have previously recorded our assets. If and to the extent that we use leverage to finance our investments that are or become liquid, the adverse impact on us related to trying to sell assets in a short period of time for cash could be greatly exacerbated.\nRisks Related to Our Organizational Structure and Business Operations\nWe depend on our key personnel, and the loss of their services or the loss of investor confidence in such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on the efforts, skill, reputations and business contacts of our key personnel, including our executive officers, which include our Executive Chairman, Thomas J. Barrack, Jr., and our Chief Executive Officer and President, Marc C. Ganzi, in particular, and the services of the other members of our senior management team, including Jacky Wu, Ronald M. Sanders and Sonia Kim, each of whom (other than Ms. Kim) has entered into an employment agreement with us. For instance, the extent and nature of the experience of our executive officers and the nature of the relationships they have developed with real estate professionals, financial institutions, investors in certain of our investment vehicles and other members of the business community are critical to the success of our business. Changes to our management team have occurred in the past, and we cannot assure stockholders that further changes will not be made. We also cannot assure stockholders of the continued employment of these individuals with the Company.\nIn addition, the success of our digital transformation depends, to a significant extent, upon the continued services of DBH\u2019s key personnel, including Mr. Ganzi and Benjamin Jenkins, DBH\u2019s co-founder and Chief Investment Officer of Digital Colony. Although Mr. Ganzi and Mr. Jenkins received equity interests in us, and are subject to employment agreements and other agreements containing restrictions on engaging in activities that are deemed competitive to our business, there can be no assurances that they will continue employment with us. The loss of Mr. Ganzi, Mr. Jenkins or other DBH personnel could harm our digital real estate business and negatively impact our ability to execute our digital transformation.\nIn addition, certain of our key personnel have been and may continue to be the subject of media attention, which includes scrutiny or criticism of our Company, business and leadership. Such attention and scrutiny could negatively impact our reputation as well as that of our key personnel, which could in turn negatively impact the relationships our key personnel have with current and potential investors, business partners, vendors and employees. Negative perceptions of or a loss of investor confidence in our key personnel could adversely impact our business prospects.\nThere may be conflicts of interest between us and our Chief Executive Officer and certain other senior DBH employees that could result in decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders.\nPrior to our combination with DBH, Marc C. Ganzi, our Chief Executive Officer and President, and Benjamin Jenkins, the Chief Investment Officer of Digital Colony, made personal investments in certain portfolio companies and/or related vehicles (collectively, the \"DBH Portfolio Companies\"), which DBH acquired along with a consortium of third party investors. In the DBH combination, we acquired the contracts to provide investment advisory and other business services to the DBH Portfolio Companies, while Mr. Ganzi and Mr. Jenkins retained their respective investments in the DBH Portfolio Companies. As a result of these personal investments and related outside business activities, Mr. Ganzi, Mr. Jenkins and certain other senior DBH employees may have control, veto rights or significant influence over, or be required to represent the interests of certain third party investors in, major decisions and other operational matters at the DBH Portfolio Companies. In addition, Mr. Ganzi, Mr. Jenkins and certain other DBH employees may be entitled to receive carried interest payments from the DBH Portfolio Companies upon the occurrence of certain events. As a result, Mr. Ganzi, Mr. Jenkins, and certain other senior DBH employees, may have different objectives than us regarding the performance and management of, transactions with or investment allocations to, the DBH Portfolio Companies. The Company has attempted, and will continue to attempt, to manage and mitigate actual or potential conflicts of interest between us, on the one hand, and Mr. Ganzi, Mr. Jenkins and certain other senior DBH employees, on the other hand; however, there can be no assurances that such attempts will be effective.\nAs a result of these personal investments, in connection with our DataBank acquisition in December 2019 and Vantage SDC acquisition in July 2020, Mr. Ganzi and Mr. Jenkins received approximately $30 million in aggregate payments, portions of which were invested into Vantage SDC alongside the Company and its co-investors. In such transactions, the Company took a series of steps to mitigate the conflicts in the transactions, including, among others, receiving a fairness opinion on the Company's purchase price from a nationally recognized third party valuation firm and obtaining approval from its board of directors. In certain of these transactions, the Company entered into agreements with Mr. Ganzi and Mr. Jenkins to provide the Company with voting rights and required that such payments received by Mr. Ganzi and Mr. Jenkins be subject to multi-year lockups and/or be re-invested in the transaction. For additional information regarding the DataBank and Vantage SDC acquisitions, see Note 20. Transactions with Affiliates, in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nAs the Company continues its digital transformation and subject to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and related party transaction policies and procedures as applicable, we may continue to enter into transactions or other arrangements with the DBH Portfolio Companies in which there are actual or potential conflicts of interests between us and Mr. Ganzi, Mr. Jenkins and certain other senior employees. Despite having related party policies and procedures in place and having conflict mitigants in such transactions, such transactions may not be on terms as favorable to us as they would have been if they had been negotiated among unrelated parties. In addition, such transactions may result in future conflicts of interest if Mr. Ganzi's or Mr. Jenkins' continuing interests in the transaction (if any) are not aligned with the Company's.\nWe have been and may continue to be subject to the actions of activist stockholders, which could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert management's attention and resources, and have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe have been and may continue to be the subject of increased activity by activist stockholders. Responding to stockholder activism can be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations and divert the attention of management and our employees from executing our business plan. In 2019 and 2020, we entered into cooperation agreements with Blackwells Capital, LLC (\"Blackwells Capital\"), an activist investor, pursuant to which, among other things, we appointed an aggregate of four new independent directors to our board of directors. In addition, in connection with the 2020 cooperation agreement, we entered into a joint venture arrangement with Blackwells Capital, to acquire, hold and dispose of the Company\u2019s stock and pursuant to which the Company contributed $14.7 million of its previously repurchased class A common stock. Activist campaigns can create perceived uncertainties as to our future direction, strategy or leadership and may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our ability to attract new investors, tenants/operators/managers and joint venture partners, cause us to incur increased legal, advisory and other expenses and cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility or stagnation. Moreover, if individuals are elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda, even though less than a majority, our ability to effectively and timely implement our current initiatives and execute on our long-term strategy may be adversely affected. We are particularly susceptible to the adverse effects of stockholder activism as we continue to executing on our digital transformation. Furthermore, there are circumstances in which our revolving credit facility could terminate and/or accelerate and various change of control payments could arise as a result of the conclusion of a proxy fight.\nOur assets may continue to be subject to impairment charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe evaluate our long-lived assets, primarily real estate held for investment, for impairment periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In evaluating and/or measuring impairment, the Company considers, among other things, current and estimated future cash flows associated with each property, market information for each sub-market and other quantitative and qualitative factors. Another key consideration in this assessment is the Company's assumptions about the highest and best use of its real estate investments and its intent and ability to hold them for a reasonable period that would allow for the recovery of their carrying values. These key assumptions are subjective in nature and could differ materially from actual results if the property was disposed. Changes in our strategy or changes in the marketplace may alter the hold period of an asset or asset group, which may result in an impairment loss, and such loss could be material to our financial condition or operating performance. If, after giving effect to such changes, we conclude that the carrying values of such assets or asset groups are no longer recoverable, we may recognize impairments in future periods equal to the excess of the carrying values over the estimated fair value. For example, in 2020, we recognized an aggregate of $1.96 billion in impairment of real estate, predominantly related to our hospitality and wellness infrastructure portfolios. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding such impairments. Further, as the Company continues to shift its strategy to focus on the digital industry, we have and may continue to determine to sell our non-digital related assets sooner than we would have otherwise done so, which may result in taking impairment charges on such assets. Such impairments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIn addition, we have and may continue to recognize impairments on the Company's equity method investments and goodwill. For example, given the prolonged period of time that the carrying value of our investment in CLNC had exceeded its market value, we recognized an $275 million other-than-temporary impairment on its CLNC investment in the second quarter 2020. The foregoing impairment was in addition to the $228 million other-than-temporary impairment on its CLNC investment recognized in the second quarter 2019. In addition, during 2020, we recognized an aggregate of $594 million in impairments to our other investment management goodwill. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding such impairments. Further, the remaining value of our other investment management business goodwill is attributable to our credit management business. As we accelerate our digital transformation, we may fully write off such remaining other investment management business goodwill upon an exit of the credit management business.\nThese subjective assessments have a direct impact on our net income because recording an impairment charge results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income. There can be no assurance that we will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of our assets. Any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the charge is taken.\nThomas J. Barrack, Jr., our Executive Chairman, controls a significant number of votes in any matter presented to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors.\nIn connection with the acquisition on April 2, 2015 by Colony\u2019s operating partnership of substantially all of the real estate and investment management businesses and operations of Colony Capital, LLC (\"CCLLC\"), Mr. Barrack was issued shares of Colony's class B common stock which had additional voting rights. In the Merger, such Colony class B common stock was exchanged for shares of our class B Common Stock. Mr. Barrack controls a significant number of votes in matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors, as a result of his beneficial ownership of our class B Common Stock. Mr. Barrack may have interests that differ from our other stockholders and may vote in ways that may not be consistent with the interests of those other stockholders.\nOur tax protection and related agreements could limit our ability to sell certain properties, engage in a strategic transaction or reduce our level of indebtedness, which could materially and adversely affect us.\nAt the closing of the Merger, CCLLC, CCH Management Partners I, LLC, FHB Holding LLC and Richard B. Saltzman (the Company's former Chief Executive Officer), each of which we refer to as a protected member, entered into a tax protection agreement with the Company and the OP (the \"TPA\"). The TPA provides that each protected member is indemnified on an after-tax basis for any Section 704(c) gain, calculated as provided in the TPA, as a result of a transaction occurring during the period commencing on June 3, 2016 and ending on January 10, 2022 (i.e., the fifth anniversary of the closing of the Merger) (the \"Tax Protection Period\") and that is considered to be a sale of the tax goodwill, going concern value or airplane owned by the OP and contributed (directly or indirectly) by such protected members, which we refer to, collectively, as the protected property, other than on transfers to the protected members or persons or entities related to the protected members. The TPA also applies to a merger or other transaction that would convert interests in the OP held by the protected members to cash or otherwise result in a taxable disposition of such interests, but does not apply to a transaction in which the equity interests of the protected members are maintained in a manner that does not trigger gain or offers the protected members the option to roll over their investment into an equity interest that is substantially equivalent (including value, profit and loss share, distribution rights and liquidity) to the equity interests exchanged in such transaction.\nIf our tax indemnification obligations are triggered under these agreements, we will be required to pay damages for the resulting tax consequences to the protected members and the calculation of damages will not be based on the time value of money or the time remaining within the restricted period. Moreover, these obligations may restrict our ability to engage in a strategic transaction. As of December 31, 2020, the OP estimates that if all of its assets subject to the TPA are sold in a taxable transaction, its indemnification obligations (based on tax rates applicable for the taxable year ended December 31, 2020 and exchange values and including additional payments to compensate the protected members for additional tax liabilities resulting from the indemnification payments) could be up to $80 million.\nIn addition, these and related obligations may require us to maintain more or different indebtedness than we would otherwise require for our business. For example, the TPA requires that the OP maintain at least $1.05 billion of certain non-recourse liabilities during the Tax Protection Period.\nThe occurrence of a security breach or a deficiency in our cybersecurity has the potential to disrupt our operations, cause material harm to our financial condition, result in misappropriation of assets, compromise confidential information and/or damage our business relationships.\nAs an asset manager, our business is highly dependent on information technology networks and systems, including systems provided by third parties over which we have no control. We may also have limited opportunity to verify the effectiveness of systems provided by third parties or to cause third parties to implement necessary or desirable improvements for such systems. In the normal course of business, we and our service providers process proprietary, confidential, and personal information provided by our tenants, employees, and vendors. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusions, including by computer hackers, nation-state affiliated actors, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. A security breach or a significant and extended disruption to our systems and, in particular, systems provided by third parties, may result in compromise or corruption of, or unauthorized access to, proprietary, confidential, or personal information collected in the course of conducting our business; misappropriation of assets; disruption of our operations, material harm to our financial condition, cash flows, and the market price of our common shares, significant remediation expenses; and increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs. A security\nbreach or disruption could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting requirements, loss of competitive position, regulatory actions, litigation, breach of contracts, reputational harm, damage to our stakeholder relationships, or legal liability.\nThese risks require continuous and likely increasing attention and other resources from us to, among other actions, identify and quantify these risks; upgrade and expand our technologies, systems, and processes to adequately address them; and provide periodic training for our employees to assist them in detecting phishing malware, and other schemes. This diverts time and resources from other activities. Although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our networks and systems, and the proprietary, confidential and personal information that resides on or is transmitted through them, and we have implemented various cyber security policies, procedures capabilities to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of our strategic partnerships and joint ventures.\nWe have and may continue to enter into strategic partnerships and joint ventures to support growth in our business. We may also make investments in partnerships or other co-ownership arrangements or participations with third parties. In connection with our investments, our partners provide, among other things, property management, investment advisory, sub-advisory and other services to us and certain of the companies that we manage. We may not realize any of the anticipated benefits of our strategic partnerships and joint ventures. Such investments and any future strategic partnerships and/or joint ventures subject us and the companies we manage to risks and uncertainties not otherwise present with other methods of investment.\nFor a substantial portion of our assets, we rely upon joint venture partners to manage the day-to-day operations of the joint venture and underlying assets, as well as to prepare financial information for the joint venture. Any failure to perform these obligations may have a negative impact on our financial performance and results of operations. In addition, the terms of the agreements with our partners may limit or restrict our ability to make additional capital contributions for the benefit of properties or to sell or otherwise dispose of properties or interests held in joint ventures, even for ventures where we are the controlling partner. In certain instances, we may not control our joint venture investments. In these ventures, the controlling partner(s) may be able to take actions which are not in our best interests or the best interests of the investments we manage. Furthermore, to the extent that our joint venture partner provides services to the companies we manage, certain conflicts of interest will exist. Moreover, we may decide to terminate a strategic relationship or joint venture partner, which could be costly and time-consuming for our management team.\nAny of the above might subject us to liabilities and thus reduce our returns on our investment with that joint venture partner, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, disagreements or disputes between us and our joint venture partner(s) could result in litigation, which could increase our expenses and potentially limit the time and effort our officers and directors are able to devote to our business.\nWe are subject to substantial litigation risks and may face significant liabilities and damage to our professional reputation as a result of litigation allegations and negative publicity.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are subject to the risk of substantial litigation and face significant regulatory oversight. Such litigation and proceedings, including, among others, regulatory actions and shareholder class action suits relating to transactions in which we have agreed to acquire public companies, may result in defense costs, settlements, fines or judgments against us, some of which may not be covered by insurance. Litigation could be more likely in connection with a change of control transaction or during periods of market dislocation, shareholder activism or proxy contests. In 2018 and 2020, several class action lawsuits and related derivative actions were filed against our Company and certain of our current and former executive officers and directors alleging certain violations of securities laws and omissions or misstatements regarding disclosures made in connection with our business and/or the 2017 merger of our predecessor entities. The 2018 and 2020 lawsuits were dismissed with prejudice; however, we cannot guarantee that additional lawsuits will not be filed against us in the future. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such litigation or proceedings. An unfavorable outcome could negatively impact our cash flow, financial condition, results of operations and trading price of our shares of class A common stock.\nIn addition, even in the absence of misconduct, we may be exposed to litigation or other adverse consequences where investments perform poorly and investors in or alongside our managed companies experience losses. We depend to a large extent on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and high-caliber professional services to attract and retain investors and to pursue investment opportunities for us and our managed companies. As a result, allegations of improper conduct by private litigants (including investors in or alongside our managed companies) or regulators, whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us, as well as negative publicity and press\nspeculation about us, our investment activities or the private equity industry in general, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation, which may be more damaging to our business than to other types of businesses.\nOur cost reduction programs may not be effective, might have unintended consequences and could negatively impact our business.\nIn recent years, we have implemented cost reduction programs to reduce annual compensation and administrative expenses. In connection with our most recent cost reduction program in 2020, we achieved annual run-rate cost savings of approximately $55 million, but also incurred approximately $30 million in related charges through December 31, 2020. To the extent we continue to initiate cost reduction programs to further our annual compensation and administrative cost savings, we may incur additional restructuring charges.\nAs a result of cost reduction programs, we have and may continue to face a variety of risks and uncertainties relating to the effectiveness of such activities. Despite our planning, our cost reduction programs could have unexpected negative consequences. As part of our workforce reduction, we may experience additional attrition, which may expose us to legal claims against us and loss of necessary human resources, which could adversely impact our ability to conduct our operations effectively. If we face costly employee or contract termination claims, our operations and prospects could be harmed. In addition, there can be no assurance that the cost reductions we have made will be successful or are the right reductions for our business going forward. There is a risk that the cost savings initiatives, restructurings and reductions in personnel will make it more difficult to conduct our business and operations.\nRisks Related to Financing\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet all of our existing or potential future debt service obligations.\nOur ability to meet all of our existing or potential future debt service obligations (including those under our revolving credit facility, pursuant to which we may incur significant indebtedness), to refinance our existing or potential future indebtedness, and to fund our operations, working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and other important business uses, depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow in the future. Our future cash flow is subject to, among other factors, general economic, industry, financial, competitive, operating, legislative, and regulatory conditions, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future sources of cash will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet all of our existing or potential future debt service obligations, or to fund our other important business uses or liquidity needs. Furthermore, if we incur additional indebtedness in connection with future acquisitions or for any other purpose, our existing or potential future debt service obligations could increase significantly and our ability to meet those obligations could depend, in large part, on the returns from such acquisitions or projects, as to which no assurance can be given.\nFurthermore, our obligations under the terms of our borrowings could impact us negatively. For example, such obligations could:\n\u2022limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022restrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022restrict us from paying dividends to our stockholders;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022require a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our borrowings, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities.\nWe may also need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness at or prior to the scheduled maturity. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing will depend on, among other things, (i) our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, core funds from operations (\"Core FFO\") prospects, and then-current market conditions; and (ii) restrictions in the agreements governing our indebtedness. As a result, we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all.\nIf we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and additional borrowings or refinancings are not available to us, we may be unable to meet all of our existing or potential future debt service obligations. As a result, we would be\nforced to take other actions to meet those obligations, such as selling properties, raising equity or delaying capital expenditures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that we will be able to effect any of these actions on favorable terms, or at all.\nChanges in the debt financing markets could negatively impact our ability to obtain attractive financing or re-financing for our investments and could increase the cost of such financing if it is obtained, which could lead to lower-yielding investments and potentially decrease our net income.\nA significant contraction in the market for debt financing, such as the contraction that occurred in 2008 and 2009, or other adverse changes relating to the terms of such debt financing with, for example, higher interest rates, higher capital requirements and/or more restrictive covenants, particularly in the area of acquisition financings for leveraged buyout and real assets transactions, could have a material adverse impact on our business. In the event that we are unable to obtain committed debt financing for potential acquisitions or can only obtain debt at an increased interest rate or on unfavorable terms, we may have difficulty completing otherwise profitable acquisitions or may generate profits that are lower than would otherwise be the case, either of which could lead to a decrease in the income earned by us. Similarly, we regularly utilize the corporate debt markets in order to obtain financing for our operations. To the extent that the credit markets render such financing difficult to obtain or more expensive, this may negatively impact our operating performance. In addition, to the extent that the markets make it difficult or impossible to refinance debt that is maturing in the near term, we may be unable to repay such debt at maturity and may be forced to sell assets, undergo a recapitalization or seek bankruptcy protection.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely affect the value of our investments and cause our interest expense to increase, which could result in reduced earnings or losses and negatively affect our profitability as well as the cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nThe value of our investments in certain assets may decline if long-term interest rates increase. Declines in the value of our investments may ultimately reduce earnings or result in losses to us, which may negatively affect cash available for distribution to our stockholders. Significant increases in interest rates may, among other things, increase the credit risk of our assets by negatively impacting the ability of the borrowers to pay debt service on our floating rate loan assets or our ability to refinance our assets upon maturity, negatively impact the value of the real estate collateralizing our investments (or the real estate we own directly) through the impact such increases can have on property valuation capitalization rates and decrease the value of our fixed-rate debt investments.\nIn addition, in a period of rising interest rates, our operating results will partially depend on the difference between the income from our assets and financing costs. We anticipate that, in some cases, the income from such assets will respond more slowly to interest rate fluctuations than the cost of our borrowings. Consequently, changes in interest rates, particularly short-term interest rates, may significantly influence our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning investments and the interest expense we incur in financing these investments. Increases in these rates could decrease our net income and the market value of our assets.\nRising interest rates may also affect the yield on our investments or target investments and the financing cost of our debt. If rising interest rates cause us to be unable to acquire a sufficient volume of our target investments with a yield that is above our borrowing cost, our ability to satisfy our investment objectives and to generate income and pay dividends may be materially and adversely affected. Due to the foregoing, significant fluctuations in interest rates could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial conditions and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nThe future of the reference rate used in our existing floating rate debt instruments and hedging arrangements is uncertain, which could hinder our ability to maintain effective hedges and could adversely impact our business operations and financial results.\nOur floating-rate debt, certain senior and junior subordinated notes and certain hedging transactions determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), or to another financial metric. In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) announced that the FCA intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (\u201cIBA\u201d), announced that it will consult on its intention to cease the publication of the one week and two month USD LIBOR settings after December 31, 2021, and the remaining USD LIBOR settings after June 30, 2023. This consultation closed on January 25, 2021 and may result in a statement that clarifies the expected timing for LIBOR discontinuation; however, the results of the consultation are not yet known. In addition, notwithstanding the IBA announcement, the United States Federal Reserve along with other banking regulators issued a statement advising banks to lay out a plan to stop writing new LIBOR contracts by the end of 2021.\nIn light of these recent announcements, the future of LIBOR is uncertain and any changes in the methods by which USD LIBOR is determined or regulatory activity related to USD LIBOR\u2019s phaseout could cause USD LIBOR to perform\ndifferently than in the past or cease to exist. Despite progress made to date by regulators, banks and industry and market participants to prepare for the anticipated discontinuation of LIBOR, including on proposals for replacement reference rates such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d), significant uncertainties remain regarding the future of LIBOR. Such uncertainties relate to, for example, whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark rate, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, how any replacement would be implemented across the industry, and the effect of any changes in industry views or movement to alternative benchmarks would have on the markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments.\nWe can provide no assurance regarding the future of LIBOR and when our current floating rate debt instruments and hedging arrangements will transition from LIBOR as a reference rate to SOFR or another reference rate. To date we have taken steps intended to minimize disruption in our business operations in the event of LIBOR discontinuation, including, where possible, by providing mechanisms in our LIBOR based instruments that permit or facilitate the movement from LIBOR to replacement benchmarks upon the occurrence of certain defined events occur related to the discontinuation of LIBOR. However, there can be no assurances that such steps will successfully minimize disruption or result in any of the benefits we anticipate. The discontinuation of a benchmark rate or other financial metric, changes in a benchmark rate or other financial metric, or changes in market perceptions of the acceptability of a benchmark rate or other financial metric, including LIBOR, could, among other things, result in increased interest payments, changes to our risk exposures, or require renegotiation of previous transactions. In addition, any such discontinuation or changes, whether actual or anticipated, could result in market volatility, adverse tax or accounting effects, increased compliance, legal and operational costs, and risks associated with contract negotiations. Further, confusion related to the transition from USD-LIBOR to SOFR or another replacement reference rate for our floating debt and hedging instruments could have an uncertain economic effect on these instruments, hinder our ability to establish effective hedges and result in a different economic value over time for these instruments than they otherwise would have had under USD-LIBOR, any of which could adversely impact our business operations and financial results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Securities\nThe market price of our class A common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and holders of our class A common stock could lose all or a significant portion of their investment due to drops in the market price of our class A common stock.\nThe market price of our class A common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. Our stockholders may not be able to resell their common stock at or above the implied price at which they acquired such common stock pursuant to the merger agreement or otherwise due to fluctuations in the market price of our class A common stock, including changes in market price caused by factors unrelated to our operating performance or prospects. Additionally, this volatility and other factors have and may continue to induce stockholder activism, which has been increasing in publicly traded companies in recent years and to which we have and continue to be subject, and could materially disrupt our business, operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nSpecific factors that may have a significant effect on the market price of our class A common stock include, among others, the following:\n\u2022changes in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our class A common stock, other companies comparable to it or companies in the industries we serve;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects;\n\u2022reactions to public announcements by us;\n\u2022changes in our dividend policy;\n\u2022impairment charges affecting the carrying value of one or more of our investments;\n\u2022media attention about our Company or our management team;\n\u2022strategic actions taken by our Company or our competitors, such as business separations, acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022failure of our Company to achieve the perceived benefits of certain transactions and restructurings, including financial results and anticipated cost savings and synergies, as rapidly as or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts;\n\u2022changes or other announcements regarding our key management personnel;\n\u2022adverse conditions in the financial market or general U.S. or international economic conditions, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, outbreaks of disease and epidemics, such as the Coronavirus, and responses to such events; and\n\u2022sales of common stock by our Company, members of our management team or significant stockholders.\nWe may issue additional equity securities, which may dilute your interest in us.\nIn order to expand our business, we may consider offering class A common stock and securities that are convertible into our class A common stock and may issue additional common stock in connection with acquisitions or joint ventures. If we issue and sell additional shares of our class A common stock, the ownership interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted to the extent they do not participate in the offering. The number of shares of class A common stock that we may issue for cash in non-public offerings without stockholder approval will be limited by the rules of the NYSE. However, we may issue and sell shares of our class A common stock in public offerings, and there generally are exceptions that allow companies to issue a limited number of equity securities in private offerings without stockholder approval, which could dilute your ownership. In July 2020, the OP issued $300 million in aggregate principal balance of 5.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2023, which are exchangeable by the noteholder at any time prior to maturity into shares of our class A common stock. The initial exchange rate, which is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, was 434.7826 shares of class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes and represented a conversion price of $2.30 per share of class A common stock. To the extent we issue shares of our class A common stock upon exchange of the notes, the exchange of some or all of our notes will substantially dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of shares of our class A common stock issuable upon such exchange of the notes could adversely affect the prevailing market price.\nIn addition, we have and may continue to issue OP Units in the OP to current employees or third parties without stockholder approval. During 2019, we issued an aggregate of 22,090,587 OP Units, representing approximately 4.5% of our outstanding class A common stock, primarily in connection with our acquisition of DBH and ownership interest in an edge data center company. Subject to any applicable vesting or lock-up restrictions and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the OP agreement, a holder of OP Units may elect to redeem such OP Units for cash or, at the Company's option, shares of our class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. As a result of such OP Unit issuances and potential future issuances, your ownership will be diluted.\nOur board of directors may modify our authorized shares of stock of any class or series and may create and issue a class or series of common stock or preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nOur Articles of Amendment and Restatement (our \"Charter\") authorizes our board of directors to, without stockholder approval, classify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock; reclassify any previously classified, but unissued, shares of common stock or preferred stock into one or more classes or series of stock; and issue such shares of stock so classified or reclassified. Our board of directors may determine the relative rights, preferences, and privileges of any class or series of common stock or preferred stock issued. As a result, we may issue series or classes of common stock or preferred stock with preferences, dividends, powers, and rights (voting or otherwise) senior to the rights of current holders of our class A common stock. The issuance of any such classes or series of common stock or preferred stock could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control transaction that might otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nRisks Related to Our Incorporation in Maryland\nThe stock ownership limits imposed by the Code for REITs and our Charter may restrict our business combination opportunities.\nIn order for us to maintain our qualification as a REIT under the Code, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities) at any time during the last half of each taxable year following our first year. Our Charter, with certain exceptions, authorizes our board of directors to take those actions that are necessary and desirable to preserve our qualification as a REIT. In order to assist us in complying with the limitations on the concentration of ownership of REIT stock imposed by the Code, our Charter generally prohibits any person (other than a person who has been granted an exemption) from actually or constructively owning more than 9.8% of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our capital stock (as defined in our Charter) by value or 9.8% of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of our common stock (as defined in our Charter) by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive. Our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, grant an exemption to the ownership limits, subject to certain conditions and the receipt by our board of directors of certain representations and undertakings. The ownership limits imposed under the Code are based upon direct or indirect ownership by \u201cindividuals,\u201d but only during the last half of a tax year. The ownership limits contained in our Charter are\nbased on the ownership at any time by any \u201cperson,\u201d which term includes entities. These ownership limitations are common in REIT charters and are intended to provide added assurance of compliance with the tax law requirements, and to minimize administrative burdens. However, the ownership limit on our common stock might also delay or prevent a transaction or a change in our control that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders, and the proposed reduction in the ownership limit could further restrict such transactions that may otherwise not be so delayed or prevented.\nCertain provisions of Maryland law could inhibit changes in control.\nCertain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (\"MGCL\") may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or impeding a change of control that could provide our stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of our common stock, including:\n\u2022\u201cbusiness combination\u201d provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between us and an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of our outstanding voting stock), or an affiliate thereof, for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter imposes special appraisal rights and supermajority voting requirements on these combinations; and\n\u2022\u201ccontrol share\u201d provisions that provide that holders of \u201ccontrol shares\u201d of our company (defined as voting shares which, when aggregated with all other shares owned or controlled by the stockholder, entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of issued and outstanding \u201ccontrol shares\u201d) have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares.\nThe statute permits various exemptions from its provisions, including business combinations that are exempted by a board of directors prior to the time that the \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d becomes an interested stockholder. Our board of directors has, by resolution, exempted any business combination between us and any person who is an existing, or becomes in the future, an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d provided that any such business combination is first approved by our board of directors (including a majority of the directors of our company who are not affiliates or associates of such person). Consequently, the five-year prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to business combinations between us and any such person. As a result, such person may be able to enter into business combinations with us that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders, without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and the other provisions of the statute. Additionally, this resolution may be altered, revoked or repealed in whole or in part at any time and we may opt back into the business combination provisions of the MGCL. If this resolution is revoked or repealed, the statute may discourage others from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating any offer. In the case of the control share provisions of the MGCL, we have elected to opt out of these provisions of the MGCL pursuant to a provision in our bylaws.\nConflicts of interest may exist or could arise in the future with the OP and its members, which may impede business decisions that could benefit our stockholders.\nConflicts of interest may exist or could arise as a result of the relationships between us and our affiliates, on the one hand, and the OP or any member thereof, on the other. Our directors and officers have duties to our Company and our stockholders under applicable Maryland law in connection with their management of our Company. At the same time, the Company, as sole managing member of the OP, has fiduciary duties to the OP and to its members under Delaware law in connection with the management of the OP. Our duties to the OP and its members, as the sole managing member, may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to our Company and our stockholders. As of the date of this report, Mr. Barrack indirectly owns approximately 4.9% in the OP and Mr. Ganzi indirectly owns approximately 1.8% in the OP. These conflicts may be resolved in a manner that is not in the best interest of our stockholders.\nRisks Related to Our Wellness Infrastructure Business\nApproximately 28% of our real estate investments are concentrated in healthcare properties, which increases the likelihood of risks related to owning healthcare real estate properties becoming more material to our business and results of operations.\nHealthcare real estate properties currently represent approximately 28% of our real estate portfolio. As a result of this concentration of healthcare real estate properties, our exposure to the risks inherent in investments in the healthcare sector has also increased, making us more vulnerable to a downturn or slowdown in the healthcare sector. We cannot be certain that our tenants, operators and managers will achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that will enable them to satisfy their obligations to us. We also cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation will not\nadversely affect the healthcare industry. Any adverse changes in the regulation of the healthcare industry or the competitiveness of our tenants, operators and managers could have a more pronounced effect on us than if our investments were more diversified.\nWe have significant leverage on our healthcare properties, which increases the risk of loss associated with our healthcare investments, impacts our liquidity and restricts our ability to engage in certain activities.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $2.7 billion of borrowings outstanding on our healthcare properties. Use of leverage increases our risk of loss, impacts our liquidity and restricts our ability to engage in certain activities, including our ability to implement certain strategic initiatives or dispose of certain assets. If we fail to comply with the covenants required by our borrowings or do not generate sufficient cash flow to service our borrowings, our liquidity may be materially and adversely affected. We have been, and may in the future be, in default, on the non-recourse borrowings associated with our healthcare properties as a result of the failure of our operators or managers to satisfy certain performance thresholds or other covenants. In particular, if certain of our operators continue to experience operating difficulties, our ability to comply with our obligations under our borrowings may be subject to additional stress. As a result of these defaults or if we default on additional borrowings, we may be required to repay outstanding obligations, including penalties, prior to the stated maturity, be subject to cash flow sweeps or potentially have assets foreclosed upon. In addition, we may be unable to refinance borrowings when they become due on favorable terms, at similar interest rate levels, or at all, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe do not control the operations of our senior housing, skilled nursing and other wellness infrastructure assets and are therefore dependent on the operators and managers, as applicable, of these properties to successfully operate their businesses.\nOur senior housing, skilled nursing and other wellness infrastructure assets are typically operated by healthcare operators pursuant to net leases or by independent third party managers pursuant to management agreements. As a result, we are unable to directly implement strategic business decisions with respect to the daily operation and marketing of these properties. We also rely on operators and managers to operate our properties in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Given the disproportionate impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on senior housing and skilled nursing facilities, there is a material risk that these facilities may be subject to lawsuits and administrative scrutiny for failing to take appropriate measures to comply with infection control protocols, leading to illnesses and deaths of patients, residents and staff. Even if a facility was not materially affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the entire senior services industry is likely to experience heightened scrutiny by state and federal regulatory authorities and plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys. While we have various rights as the property owner under our leases or management agreements and monitor the operators/managers\u2019 performance, we may have limited recourse under our leases or management agreements if we believe that the operators/managers are not performing adequately. Failure by the operators/managers to adequately manage the risks associated with operations of these properties could result in defaults under our borrowings and otherwise affect adversely our results of operations. Furthermore, if our operators/managers experience any significant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties, such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on us.\nDecreases in our operators\u2019 revenues or increases in our operators\u2019 expenses could negatively affect our financial results.\nOur operators\u2019 revenues are primarily driven by occupancy, private pay rates, and Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if applicable. Expenses for these facilities are primarily driven by the costs of labor, food, utilities, taxes, insurance, compliance activities, rent or debt service. Revenues from government reimbursement may continue to be subject to reimbursement cuts, disruptions in payment, audit and recovery actions, and state budget shortfalls. Additionally, federal and state governmental entities are considering and may impose new regulatory obligations that could increase costs, expose our operators to financial penalties or program suspension or exclusion, or limit their number of residents or patients. Operating costs, including labor costs and costs of compliance with government programs, continue to increase for our operators. To the extent that any decrease in revenues and/or any increase in operating expenses result in a property not generating sufficient cash, our operators may not be able to make payments to us. Failure of our operators to perform could result in defaults under our borrowings. As a result, we may need to negotiate new leases with our operators or replace such operators, which may subject us to significant liabilities and expense. Under these circumstances, we have recorded and may need to further record impairment for such assets. Furthermore, if we determine to dispose of an underperforming property, such sale may result in a loss. Any such impairment or loss on sale would negatively affect our financial results.\nWe are directly exposed to operational risks at certain of our healthcare properties, which could adversely affect our revenue and operations.\nWe operate a substantial number of healthcare properties pursuant to management agreements with third party managers, whereby we are directly exposed to various operational risks with respect to these healthcare properties that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues. These risks include fluctuations in occupancy, government reimbursement, if applicable, private pay rates, economic conditions, competition, federal, state, local and industry-regulated licensure, certification, fraud and abuse and privacy and security laws, regulations and standards and related audits, investigations and litigation, the availability and increases in cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage (including as a result of climate change or other natural disasters), the impact of actual and anticipated outbreaks of disease and epidemics, such as COVID-19, rent control regulations, the imposition of new or increased taxes, capital expenditure requirements, and the availability and increases in the cost of food, materials, energy, or labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise). If any of these properties does not generate sufficient revenues to cover its expenses, we are responsible for any operating shortfalls. Any one or a combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue and operations. Refer to \u201cOperating and Regulatory Structure-U.S. Healthcare Regulation\u201d included in Item 1 of this Annual Report for further discussion.\nSenior Lifestyles Corporation and its affiliates (\u201cSLC\u201d) manages a significant portion of these senior housing facilities. Because SLC manages our properties in exchange for a management fee from us, we are not exposed to its credit risk. However, failure of SLC to manage our properties efficiently and effectively could have a significant adverse impact on us. We monitor and assess numerous factors, including legal, contractual, regulatory, business and other relevant considerations, in determining whether to pursue any rights or remedies under our management agreements with SLC, including termination. If we elected to terminate the management agreements for any properties, we would attempt to reposition the properties, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate a suitable replacement manager or that the replacement manager would manage the properties effectively.\nIf we must replace any of our tenants, operators or managers, we might be unable to reposition the properties on as favorable terms, or at all, and we could be subject to delays, limitations and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nFollowing expiration of a lease term or if we exercise our right to replace a tenant, operator or manager in default, we will attempt to reposition properties. However, rental payments on the related properties could decline or cease altogether while we reposition the properties with a suitable replacement tenant, operator or manager. We also may not be successful in identifying suitable replacements or enter into new leases or management agreements on a timely basis or on terms as favorable to us as our current leases and management agreements, if at all, and we may be required to fund certain expenses and obligations (e.g., real estate taxes, debt costs and maintenance expenses) to preserve the value of, and avoid the imposition of liens on, our properties while they are being repositioned. In addition, we may incur certain obligations and liabilities, including obligations to indemnify the replacement tenant, operator or manager. Once a suitable replacement tenant/operator/manager has taken over operation of the properties, it may still take an extended period of time before the properties are fully repositioned and value restored, if at all. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreased competition may affect the performance of our operating properties, as well as our operators\u2019 ability to meet their obligations to us.\nThe healthcare industry is highly competitive, and our operators and managers may encounter increased competition for residents, including with respect to the scope and quality of care and services provided, reputation and financial condition, physical appearance of the properties, price and location. Our operators and managers also compete for labor, making their results sensitive to changes in the labor market and/or wages and benefits offered to their employees. If our operators and managers are unable to successfully compete with other operators and managers by maintaining profitable occupancy and rate levels or controlling labor costs, our performance may be directly or indirectly materially adversely affected, potentially decreasing our revenues or impairing our assets.\nThe hospitals on or near whose campuses many of our medical office buildings (\"MOBs\") are located and their affiliated health systems could fail to remain competitive or financially viable, which could adversely impact their ability to attract physicians and physician groups to our MOBs.\nOur MOB operations depend on the competitiveness and financial viability of the hospitals on or near whose campuses our MOBs are located. The viability of these hospitals, in turn, depends on factors such as the quality and mix of healthcare services provided, competition for patients, physicians and physician groups, demographic trends in the surrounding community, market position and growth potential. A hospital\u2019s inability to remain competitive or financially\nviable, or to attract physicians and physician groups, could materially adversely affect our MOB operations and have a material adverse effect on us.\nFailure to comply with certain healthcare laws and regulations could adversely affect our operations, expose us to liability and jeopardize our tenants/operators\u2019 abilities to meet their obligations to us.\nOur wellness infrastructure assets generally are subject to varying levels of federal, state, local, and industry regulated laws, regulations and standards. Our tenants/operators/managers\u2019 failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations or standards could result in denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines, penalties or damages, suspension, decertification or exclusion from federal and state healthcare programs, loss of license, loss of accreditation or certification, or closure of the facility. For our operating properties, our operations may be directly impacted by any such actions and expose us to liability. For our net leased properties, such actions may have an effect on our tenants/operators\u2019 ability to meet all of their obligations to us, including obligations to make lease payments, and, therefore, adversely impact us. Refer to \u201cOperating and Regulatory Structure-U.S. Healthcare Regulation\u201d included in Item 1 of this Annual Report for further discussion.\nChanges in the reimbursement rates or methods of payment from third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, could have a material adverse effect on certain of our tenants and operators and on us.\nCertain of our wellness infrastructure assets rely on reimbursement from third party payors, including payments received through the Medicare and Medicaid programs, for substantially all of their revenues. Federal and state legislators and healthcare financing authorities have adopted or proposed various cost-containment measures that would limit payments to healthcare providers and have considered Medicaid rate freezes or cuts. Additionally, some states are considering changes that would affect beneficiary eligibility for Medicaid. See \u201cOperating and Regulatory Structure-U.S. Healthcare Regulation\u201d included in Item 1 of this Annual Report. Private third party payors also have continued their efforts to control healthcare costs. We cannot assure you that we, or our tenants and operators who currently depend on governmental or private payor reimbursement, will be adequately reimbursed for the services provided. Significant limits by governmental and private third party payors on the scope of services reimbursed or on reimbursement rates and fees, whether from legislation, administrative actions or private payor efforts, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nSignificant legal actions or regulatory proceedings could subject us or our tenants and operators to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to claims brought against us in lawsuits and other legal or regulatory proceedings arising out of our alleged actions or the alleged actions of managers. From time to time, we may also be subject to claims brought against us arising out of the alleged actions of our tenants and operators and for which such tenants and operators may have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless. An unfavorable resolution of any such litigation or proceeding could materially adversely affect our or their liquidity, financial condition and results of operations and have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn certain cases, we and our tenants, operators and managers may be subject to professional liability claims brought by plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys seeking significant punitive damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. Due to the historically high frequency and severity of professional liability claims against senior housing and healthcare providers, the availability of professional liability insurance has decreased and the premiums on such insurance coverage remain costly. The number of claims of this nature may increase on account of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These claims, with or without merit, could cause us to incur substantial costs, harm our reputation and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain residents, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, professional liability carriers may seek to exclude claims related to COVID-19 from coverage. As a result, insurance protection against such claims may not be sufficient to cover all claims against us or our tenants, operators or managers, and may not be available at a reasonable cost. If we or our tenants, operators and managers are unable to maintain adequate insurance coverage or are required to pay punitive damages, we or they may be exposed to substantial liabilities.\nRisks Related to Our Hospitality Business\nA significant portion of our real estate investments are concentrated in hotels, which increases our exposure to risks affecting the hospitality industry.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our hotel properties (including the THL Hotel Portfolio) represents approximately 28% of our real estate portfolio. The hospitality industry is subject to changes in the travel patterns of business and leisure travelers, both of which are affected by the strength of the economy, as well as other factors. The performance of the\nhospitality industry has traditionally been closely linked with the performance of the general economy and, specifically, growth in gross domestic product. Changes in travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers, particularly during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth, may create difficulties for the industry over the long-term and adversely affect our results. The majority of our hotels are classified as upscale extended stay and upscale select service that generally target business travelers. In periods of economic difficulties, business and leisure travelers may seek to reduce travel costs by limiting travel or seeking to reduce costs on their trips. Our results of operations and any forecast we make may be affected by, and can change based on, a variety of circumstances that affect the hospitality industry, including:\n\u2022changes in the international, national, regional and local economic climate;\n\u2022changes in business and leisure travel patterns;\n\u2022increases in energy prices or airline fares or terrorist incidents, which impact the propensity of people to travel and revenues from our hospitality facilities because operating costs cannot be adjusted as quickly;\n\u2022supply growth in markets where we own hotels, which may adversely affect demand at our properties;\n\u2022the attractiveness of our hotels to consumers relative to competing hotels;\n\u2022competition and supply from alternative lodging market places in the markets in which we own hotels;\n\u2022the performance of the managers of our hotels;\n\u2022outbreaks of disease and epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact on travel of natural disasters and weather;\n\u2022physical damage to our hotels as a result of earthquakes, hurricanes, climate change or other natural disasters or the income lost as a result of the damage;\n\u2022increases in the cost or availability of property insurance for our hotel properties, as a result of climate change or other natural disaster;\n\u2022 changes in room rates and increases in operating costs due to inflation, labor costs and other factors; and\n\u2022unionization of the labor force at our hotels.\nA reduction in our revenue or earnings as a result of the above risks may reduce our working capital, impact our long-term business strategy and impact the value of our assets and our ability to meet certain covenants in our existing debt agreements.\nWe do not control our hotel operations and we are dependent on the managers of our hotels.\nTo maintain our status as a REIT, we are not permitted to operate any of our hotels. As a result, we have entered into management agreements with third-party managers to operate our hotel properties. For this reason, we are unable to directly implement strategic business decisions with respect to the daily operation and marketing of our hotels, such as decisions with respect to the setting of room rates, negotiation of corporate client contracts, food and beverage pricing and certain similar matters. Although we consult with our hotel operators with respect to strategic business plans, the hotel operators are under no obligation to implement any of our recommendations with respect to these matters. While we monitor the hotel managers\u2019 performance, we have limited recourse under our management agreements if we believe that the hotel managers are not performing adequately. The cash flow from our hotels may be affected adversely if our managers fail to provide quality services and amenities or if they or their affiliates fail to maintain the hotels in an acceptable condition.\nFrom time to time, we may have differences with the managers of our hotels over their performance and compliance with the terms of our management agreements. If we are unable to reach satisfactory results through discussions and negotiations, we may choose to litigate the dispute or submit the matter to third-party dispute resolution. Failure by our hotel managers to fully perform the duties agreed to in our management agreements or the failure of our managers to adequately manage the risks associated with hotel operations, including cyber-security risks, could affect adversely our results of operations.\nIn addition, our hotel managers or their affiliates manage, and in some cases own, have invested in, or provided credit support or operating guarantees to hotels that compete with our hotels, all of which may result in conflicts of interest. As a result, our hotel managers have in the past made, and may in the future make, decisions regarding competing hospitality facilities that are not or would not be in our best interest.\nIsland Hospitality Group, Inc. (\"Island\") manages the majority of our hotels in our hospitality segment pursuant to management agreements. In addition, Aimbridge Hospitality (\u201cAimbridge\u201d) manages all of the hotel properties in the THL Hotel Portfolio that we acquired through consensual foreclosure in July 2017. Although we have various rights as the property owner under our management agreements, we rely on Island\u2019s and Aimbridge\u2019s respective personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our hotel operations efficiently and effectively. Any adverse developments in Island\u2019s and Aimbridge\u2019s respective business and affairs or financial condition could impair their ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively and could have a materially adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel, particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor.\nOur third-party managers are responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at each of our hotels. Although we do not directly employ or manage employees at our hotels, we still are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force, particularly at those hotels with unionized labor. From time to time, hotel operations may be disrupted as a result of strikes, lockouts, public demonstrations or other negative actions and publicity. We also may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs as a result of contract disputes involving our third-party managers and their labor force or other events. The resolution of labor disputes or re-negotiated labor contracts could lead to increased labor costs, a significant component of our hotel operating costs, either by increases in wages or benefits or by changes in work rules that raise hotel operating costs. Additionally, hotels where our third-party managers have collective bargaining agreements with employees are more highly affected by labor force activities than others. Furthermore, labor agreements may limit the ability of our hotel managers to reduce the size of hotel workforces during an economic downturn because collective bargaining agreements are negotiated between the hotel managers and labor unions. Our ability, if any, to have any material impact on the outcome of these negotiations is restricted by and dependent on the individual management agreement covering a specific property and we may have little ability to control the outcome of these negotiations.\nIn addition, changes in labor laws may negatively impact us. For example, increases in minimum wage laws and the Department of Labor\u2019s recent regulations effective as of January 1, 2020, which expand the scope of non-exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act to increase the entitlement to overtime pay could significantly increase the cost of labor in the workforce, which would increase the operating costs of our hotel properties and may have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our ongoing need for renovations and capital improvements as well as financing these expenditures.\nIn order to remain competitive, our hotels have an ongoing need for renovations and other capital improvements, including replacements, from time to time, of furniture, fixtures and equipment. These capital improvements may give rise to the following risks:\n\u2022construction cost overruns and delays;\n\u2022a possible shortage of liquidity to fund capital improvements and the related possibility that financing for these capital improvements may not be available to us on affordable terms;\n\u2022the renovation investment failing to produce the returns on investment that we expect;\n\u2022disruptions in the operations of the hotel as well as in demand for the hotel while capital improvements are underway; and\n\u2022disputes with franchisors or hotel managers regarding compliance with relevant management or franchise agreements.\nWe may have insufficient liquidity to fund capital expenditures and, consequently, we may need to rely upon the availability of debt or equity capital to fund our investments and capital improvements. These sources of funds may not be available on reasonable terms and conditions or at all.\nWe have significant leverage on our hotel properties, which increases the risk of loss associated with our hotel investments, impacts our liquidity and restricts our ability to engage in certain activities.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $3.5 billion of borrowings outstanding on our hotel properties, including the THL Hotel Portfolio. Use of leverage increases our risk of loss, impacts our liquidity and restricts our ability to engage in certain activities, including our ability to implement certain transactions or dispose of certain assets. If we fail to comply with the covenants required by our borrowings or do not generate sufficient cash flow to service our borrowings, our liquidity may be materially and adversely affected. If we default on borrowings, we may be required to repay outstanding obligations,\nincluding penalties, prior to the stated maturity, be subject to cash flow sweeps or potentially have assets foreclosed upon. In addition, we may be unable to refinance borrowings when they become due on favorable terms, at similar interest rate levels, or at all, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Refer to \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business Strategy-Pandemics or disease outbreaks, such as the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, have and the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to continue to, significantly disrupt, and may materially adversely impact, our business, financial condition and ability to execute on our business objectives-Risks Related to Our Hospitality Business\u201d above for further discussion on the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact on the leverage on our hotel properties.\nRisks of operating hotels under franchise licenses, which may be terminated or not renewed, may impact our ability to make distributions to stockholders.\nThe continuation of our franchise licenses is subject to specified operating standards and other terms and conditions. All of the franchisors of our hotels periodically inspect our hotels to confirm adherence to their operating standards. The failure to maintain such standards or to adhere to such other terms and conditions could result in the loss or cancellation of the applicable franchise license. It is possible that a franchisor could condition the continuation of a franchise license on the completion of capital improvements that we determine are too expensive or otherwise not economically feasible in light of general economic conditions, the operating results or prospects of the affected hotel. In that event, we may elect to allow the franchise license to lapse or be terminated.\nThere can be no assurance that a franchisor will renew a franchise license at each option period. If a franchisor terminates a franchise license, we may be unable to obtain a suitable replacement franchise, or to successfully operate the hotel independent of a franchise license. In addition, in certain cases we have guaranteed the payment obligations under our franchise licenses and a termination of such license could cause us to be liable under our guarantee for liquidated damages. Refer to \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business Strategy-Pandemics or disease outbreaks, such as the current novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, have and the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to continue to, significantly disrupt, and may materially adversely impact, our business, financial condition and ability to execute on our business objectives-Risks Related to Our Hospitality Business\u201d above for further discussion regarding our franchise fee guarantees.\nThe loss of a franchise license could have a material adverse effect upon the operations or the underlying value of the related hotel because of the loss of associated name recognition, marketing support and centralized reservation systems provided by the franchisor. Our loss of a franchise license for one or more of the hotels could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and our amounts available for distribution to shareholders.\nIncreasing interest rates could materially impact the operating results of our hotel properties.\nAll of our hotel properties are financed with floating-rate debt. If interest rates rise, the costs of our existing floating rate borrowings and any new borrowings that we incur would increase. These increased costs could reduce the profitability of our hotel properties or impair our ability to meet our debt obligations, which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and overall financial position. An increase in interest rates also could limit our ability to refinance existing debt upon maturity or cause us to pay higher rates upon refinancing, as well as decrease the amount that third parties are willing to pay for our hotels, thereby limiting our ability to promptly reposition our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions.\nWe have obtained, and we may in the future obtain, one or more forms of interest rate protection, including swap agreements, interest rate cap contracts or similar agreements, that involve additional risks, including the risks that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements, that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing our exposure to interest rate changes, that the amount of income we earn from hedging transactions may be limited by federal tax provisions governing REITs, and that these arrangements may cause us to pay higher interest rates on our debt obligations than otherwise would be the case. Moreover, no amount of hedging activity can fully insulate us from the risks associated with changes in interest rates. Failure to hedge effectively against interest rate risk, if we choose to engage in such activities, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThere can be no assurance that the pending disposition of our hospitality business will be completed on the terms contemplated or at all or that we will be able to realize the anticipated benefits of such sale transaction.\nIn September 2020, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement with a third party to sell our $2.8 billion hospitality business, composed of 197 hotel properties in aggregate, for gross aggregate selling price of $67.5 million, subject to certain adjustments as provided in the sale agreement, as amended. The sale is expected to close in the first half of 2021. There can be no assurance that this sale transaction will be completed on the terms contemplated, in accordance with the anticipated timing or at all. Consummation of the sale is subject to customary closing conditions, including but not limited to, the acquirer\u2019s assumption of the outstanding $2.7 billion mortgage notes encumbering the\nhotel properties and third party approvals, including any applicable franchisor consent. There can be no assurance that these conditions to closing will be satisfied. Furthermore, even if we are able to consummate the sale of this business, there can be no assurance that we will realize the anticipated benefits to us of such transaction, including any amount of net proceeds from the transaction as a result of transaction costs or other transaction related expenses. Moreover, one of the Company's hospitality portfolios, which is in receivership, is not a part of the sale transaction. There can be no assurance as to when such hospitality portfolio will be foreclosed upon or sold by the receiver to a third party.\nRisks Related to Our Legacy Investment Management Business\nSee \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Our Digital Business-Risks Related to Our Digital Investment Management Business\u201d above for risk factors that are also applicable to our legacy investment management business.\nCertain of our management agreements with investment vehicles that are publicly-registered companies with the SEC are subject to limitation or termination, and any such termination could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe agreements under which we provide management and other services to companies that raise capital through the public markets are renewable upon mutual consent of the parties for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods. In certain instances, these agreements may generally be terminated by such managed public company immediately for cause, or upon 60 days\u2019 written notice, without cause or for good reason, and expire on an annual basis, unless otherwise renewed. Further, we anticipate that our managed retail public companies will pursue a liquidity transaction in the future and, if successful, certain liquidity transactions could result in termination or expiration of these agreements. With respect to our management agreement with CLNC, the initial term expires on January 31, 2021, which will automatically be renewed for successive one-year periods thereafter unless we or, in certain limited circumstances, CLNC, elect not to renew by providing 180 days prior written notice. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not expire or be terminated or not be renewed. Any such termination, expiration or non-renewal could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition to the management fees we receive from our managed companies, we are reimbursed by the publicly traded and retail companies we manage for costs and expenses we incur on their behalf, including certain indirect personnel and employment costs that we may allocate to such managed companies and disputes could arise in connection with those allocations.\nWe are paid substantial fees for the services we and our subsidiaries provide to our managed companies and we are also reimbursed by the publicly-traded and retail companies we manage for certain costs and expenses we incur and pay on their behalf. Such managed companies reimburse us, subject to certain limitations and exceptions, for both direct expenses as well as indirect costs, including our personnel and employment costs. The costs and expenses that we allocate to our publicly-traded and retail companies can be substantial and may involve subjective judgment and discretion. There are conflicts of interest that arise when we make allocation determinations. These conflicts of interest, as well as the loyalties of our executives and other real estate and finance professionals to other entities and investors, could result in action or inaction that is detrimental to our business, which could harm the implementation of our business strategy and our reputation. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we allocated $12.5 million in costs to CLNC and our retail companies, in the aggregate. These managed companies could dispute the amount of costs we allocate to them and the methodologies we use to determine those amounts. Any dispute or investigation regarding our allocation of costs and expenses could be distracting, expensive and harmful to our reputation as well as have other adverse effects on our company and future operating performance, including the potential that such managed companies could seek to terminate their relationship with us.\nIn addition, our managed companies that are publicly-traded grant, either directly or indirectly through us as manager, equity awards to certain of our employees in connection with the services that we provide to such companies as their manager. Such grants of equity awards are in the discretion and subject to the approval of the specific managed company's board of directors or compensation committee. As of the date of this report, CLNC is our only managed company that is publicly traded. In 2020, the publicly-traded companies we manage did not issue any equity awards directly or indirectly to our employees and, as a result, we issued more equity awards in our class A common stock to compensate and retain our employees. In addition, we may pursue a disposition of our management agreement with CLNC, a potential transaction with CLNC to internalize its management, a sale of the management agreement to a third party or any other transaction the effect of which would be to dispose of the management agreement. If any such disposition transaction were consummated, it would result in us no longer serving as CLNC's external manager. To the extent CLNC continues, or any future publicly-traded managed companies determines, not to grant equity awards to us or our employees, either in the amounts historically granted, recommended by us or at all, or we cease to manage CLNC (as\na result of a disposition transaction or otherwise) or any other publicly-traded company, we may continue to determine to increase the equity awards issued by our Company in order to compensate and retain our employees, which could hinder our ability to effectuate our cost savings initiatives, increase dilution to our stockholders and adversely impact our financial results.\nOur ownership of approximately 36% of CLNC, on a fully diluted basis, subjects us to various risks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn connection with our contribution of the CLNY Contributed Portfolio (as described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report), as of the date of this report, we own approximately 44.9 million shares of CLNC\u2019s class A common stock, which is listed on the NYSE, and approximately 3.1 million common membership units in CLNC's operating company (\"CLNC OP Units\"), which represent, in the aggregate, approximately 36% of CLNC\u2019s total outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis. The CLNC OP Units are redeemable for cash or class A common stock of CLNC, in CLNC\u2019s sole discretion. During 2020, there was substantial volatility in CLNC\u2019s trading price, with its class A common stock trading between $14.01 and $2.46 per share. With increasing uncertainty over the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the timeline for a recovery in the U.S economy, the Company recognized an $275 million other-than-temporary impairment on its CLNC investment in the second quarter 2020. The foregoing impairment was in addition to the $228 million other-than-temporary impairment on its CLNC investment recognized in the second quarter 2019. At December 31, 2020, the carrying value of our CLNC investment was $385 million, or $8.04 per share, while the trading price of CLNC\u2019s stock was $7.50 per share. If CLNC's class A common stock continues to trade below our current carrying value for a prolonged period of time, an other-than-temporary impairment may be recognized in the future.\nAlthough we are the external manager to CLNC and have three representatives on CLNC\u2019s board of directors who are our current and former members of our senior management team, our role as manager is under the supervision and direction of CLNC\u2019s board of directors, which has a total of seven members, a majority of whom are independent. Therefore, the value of our investment is subject to the strategies and management decisions of the CLNC board of directors as a whole, as well as the trading price of CLNC\u2019s class A common stock on the NYSE.\nIn addition, in connection with our digital transformation, we may pursue a disposition of our management agreement with CLNC, which may include without limitation a potential transaction with CLNC to internalize its management, a sale of the management agreement to a third party or any other transaction the effect of which would be to dispose of the management agreement. If any such disposition transaction were consummated, it would result in us no longer serving as CLNC's external manager. If we are no longer CLNC's manager or we no longer have any representatives on CLNC's board of directors, whether as a result of a disposition transaction or otherwise, the value of our investment would be solely dependent on the strategies and management decisions of the CLNC board of directors and, if applicable, a third party manager.\nMoreover, CLNC owns and expects to continue to originate, acquire, finance and manage a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate debt and net lease real estate investments predominantly in the United States. As a result, our investment in CLNC exposes us to the same risks that we are subject to as a result of our other equity and debt segment, as further described in \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Related to Our Other Equity and Debt Business.\u201d If any of the foregoing risks were to occur, our investment in CLNC could decline in value and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Other Equity and Debt Business\nOur commercial real estate equity, debt and mortgage loans underlying our commercial real estate securities investments are subject to the risks typically associated with commercial real estate (\"CRE\").\nOur CRE equity, debt and securities investments are subject to the risks typically associated with real estate, including:\n\u2022local, state, national or international economic conditions;\n\u2022real estate conditions, such as an oversupply of or a reduction in demand for real estate space in an area;\n\u2022lack of liquidity inherent in the nature of the asset;\n\u2022tenant/operator mix and the success of the tenant/operator business;\n\u2022the ability and willingness of tenants/operators/managers to maintain the financial strength and liquidity to satisfy their obligations to us and to third parties;\n\u2022reliance on tenants/operators/managers to operate their business in a sufficient manner and in compliance with their contractual arrangements with us;\n\u2022ability and cost to replace a tenant/operator/manager upon default;\n\u2022property management decisions;\n\u2022property operating costs, including insurance premiums, real estate taxes and maintenance costs;\n\u2022the perceptions of the quality, convenience, attractiveness and safety of the properties;\n\u2022branding, marketing and operational strategies;\n\u2022competition from comparable properties;\n\u2022the occupancy rate of, and the rental rates charged at, the properties;\n\u2022the ability to collect on a timely basis all rent;\n\u2022the effects of any bankruptcies or insolvencies;\n\u2022the expense of leasing, renovation or construction, including escalations in such expenses;\n\u2022changes in interest rates and in the availability, cost and terms of mortgage financing;\n\u2022unknown liens being placed on the properties;\n\u2022bad acts of third parties;\n\u2022the ability to refinance mortgage notes payable related to the real estate on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u2022changes in governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies;\n\u2022tax implications;\n\u2022changes in laws, including environmental laws or laws that increase operating expenses or limit rents that may be charged;\n\u2022the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws, including costs of remediation and liabilities associated with environmental conditions affecting properties;\n\u2022cost of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990;\n\u2022adverse changes in governmental rules and fiscal policies;\n\u2022social unrest and civil disturbances;\n\u2022acts of nature, including earthquakes, hurricanes and other natural disasters;\n\u2022terrorism;\n\u2022the potential for uninsured or underinsured property losses;\n\u2022adverse changes in state and local laws, including zoning laws; and\n\u2022other factors which are beyond our control.\nThe value of each property is affected significantly by its ability to generate cash flow and net income, which in turn depends on the amount of rental or other income that can be generated net of expenses required to be incurred with respect to the property. Many expenses associated with properties (such as operating expenses and capital expenses) cannot be reduced when there is a reduction in income from the properties. These factors may have a material adverse effect on the value and the return that we can realize from our assets, as well as ability of our borrowers to pay their loans and the ability of the borrowers on the underlying loans securing our securities to pay their loans.\nOur existing mezzanine loan assets and those that we may originate or acquire in the future are subject to greater risks of loss than senior loans secured by income-producing properties.\nWe currently own interests in mezzanine loans and may, subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, originate or acquire additional mezzanine loans (or interests in mezzanine loans). Mezzanine loans take the form of subordinated loans secured by junior participations in mortgages or second mortgages on the underlying property, or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership interests of either the entity owning the property or a pledge of the ownership interests of the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the property. These types of assets involve a higher degree of risk than\nlong-term senior mortgage lending secured by income-producing real property, because the loan may be foreclosed on by the senior lender. In addition, mezzanine loans may have higher loan-to-value ratios than conventional mortgage loans, resulting in less equity in the property and increasing the risk of loss of principal. If a borrower defaults on our mezzanine loan or debt senior to our loan, or in the event of a borrower bankruptcy, our mezzanine loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt is paid in full. Where debt senior to our loan exists, the presence of intercreditor arrangements between the holder of the senior mortgage loan and us, as the mezzanine lender, may limit our ability to amend our loan documents, assign our loans, accept prepayments, exercise our remedies and control decisions made in bankruptcy proceedings relating to borrowers. As a result, we may not recover some or all of our investment, which could result in losses. In addition, even if we are able to foreclose on the underlying collateral following a default on a mezzanine loan, we would replace the defaulting borrower and, to the extent income generated on the underlying property is insufficient to meet outstanding debt obligations on the property, we may need to commit substantial additional capital to stabilize the property and prevent additional defaults to lenders with remaining liens on the property. Significant losses related to our current or future mezzanine loans could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.\nRegulatory Risks\nExtensive regulation in the United States and abroad affects our activities, increases the cost of doing business and creates the potential for significant liabilities and that could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to extensive regulation, including periodic examinations by governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world. Many of these regulators, including U.S. and foreign government agencies and self-regulatory organizations and state securities commissions in the United States, are empowered to grant, and in specific circumstances to cancel, permissions to carry on particular activities, and to conduct investigations and administrative proceedings that can result in fines, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including censure, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of applicable licenses and memberships. For example, in recent years the SEC and several states have initiated investigations alleging that certain private equity firms and hedge funds, or agents acting on their behalf, have paid money to current or former government officials or their associates in exchange for improperly soliciting contracts with the state pension funds (i.e., \u201c pay to play\u201d practices). Such \u201cpay to play\u201d practices are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, and any failure on our part to comply with rules surrounding \u201cpay to play\u201d practices could expose us to significant penalties and reputational damage. Even if an investigation or proceeding does not result in a sanction or the sanction imposed against us or our personnel by a regulator were small in monetary amount, the costs incurred in responding to such matters could be material and the adverse publicity relating to the investigation, proceeding or imposition of these sanctions could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing investors or fail to gain new investors or discourage others from doing business with us.\nIn addition, we regularly rely on exemptions from various requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the 1940 Act, the Commodity Exchange Act and ERISA in conducting our investment activities in the United States. Similarly, in conducting our investment activities outside the United States, we rely on available exemptions from the regulatory regimes of various foreign jurisdictions. These exemptions from regulation within the United States and abroad are sometimes highly complex and may, in certain circumstances, depend on compliance by third parties whom we do not control. If for any reason these exemptions were to become unavailable to us, we could become subject to regulatory action or third party claims and our business could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, the requirements imposed by our regulators are designed primarily to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect investors in our funds and are not designed to protect our stockholders. Consequently, these regulations often serve to limit our activities and impose burdensome compliance requirements.\nIt is difficult to determine the full extent of the impact on us of any new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed or whether any of the proposals will become law. Any changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our business, including the changes as a result of, among others, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, may impose additional costs on us, require the attention of our senior management or result in limitations on the manner in which we conduct our business. In 2018, several changes were made to the Dodd-Frank Act, including the repeal of certain provisions that eased restrictions on small and medium-sized banks of the Dodd-Frank Act. It is expected that the Biden administration will reverse a number of U.S. President Trump\u2019s policies, includes those that relate to deregulation, and will increase the number of financial regulators as current vacancies in the bureaucracy are prioritized and filled under the new administration. Furthermore, we may become subject to additional regulatory and compliance burdens as we expand our product offerings and investment platform, including raising additional funds. Moreover, as calls for additional regulation have increased as a result of heightened regulatory focus in the financial industry, there may\nbe a related increase in regulatory investigations of the trading and other investment activities of alternative asset management funds, including our managed companies. Compliance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive, affect the manner in which we conduct our business and adversely affect our profitability.\nFailure to maintain our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act could require us to register as an investment company or substantially change the way we conduct our business, either of which may have an adverse effect on us and the market price for shares of our class A common stock.\nWe intend to conduct our operations so that we and our subsidiaries are not required to register as investment companies under the 1940 Act. Compliance with the 40% asset test under the 1940 Act and maintenance of applicable exemptions require that we subject our business to certain limitations on investment and activities. Continuing qualification for exemption from registration under the 1940 Act will limit our ability to make certain investments or change the relevant mix of our investments.\nIf we fail to maintain our exemption from registration as an investment company under the 1940 Act, either because of changes in SEC guidance or otherwise, we could be required to, among other things: (i) substantially change the manner in which we conduct our operations to avoid being required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act; or (ii) register as an investment company. Either of (i) or (ii) could have an adverse effect on us and the market price for shares of our class A common stock. If we are required to register as an investment company under the 1940 Act, we would become subject to substantial regulation with respect to our capital structure (including our ability to use leverage), management, operations, transactions with affiliated persons (as defined in the 1940 Act), portfolio composition, including restrictions with respect to diversification and industry concentration and other matters.\nRegulation of a subsidiary of our company under the Investment Advisers Act subjects us to the anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act and to fiduciary duties derived from these provisions.\nWe have subsidiaries that are registered with the SEC as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act. As a result, we are subject to the anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act and to fiduciary duties derived from these provisions that apply to our relationships with our managed companies. These provisions and duties impose restrictions and obligations on us with respect to our dealings with our managed companies' investors and our investments, including, for example, restrictions on agency, cross and principal transactions. We or our registered investment adviser subsidiaries will be subject to periodic SEC examinations and other requirements under the Investment Advisers Act and related regulations primarily intended to benefit advisory clients. These additional requirements relate to, among other things, maintaining an effective and comprehensive compliance program, recordkeeping and reporting requirements and disclosure requirements. The Investment Advisers Act generally grants the SEC broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict an investment adviser from conducting advisory activities in the event it fails to comply with federal securities laws. Additional sanctions that may be imposed for failure to comply with applicable requirements under the Investment Advisers Act include the prohibition of individuals from associating with an investment adviser, the revocation of registrations and other censures and fines.\nRegulation regarding climate change may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in federal and state legislation and regulations on climate change could result in utility expenses and/or capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties or other related aspects of our properties in order to comply with such regulations or otherwise adapt to climate change. These regulations may require unplanned capital improvements, and increased engagement to manage occupant energy use, which is a large driver of building performance. If our properties cannot meet performance standards, we could be exposed to fines for non-compliance, as well as a decrease in demand and a decline in value. As a result, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Taxation\nOur qualification as a REIT involves complying with highly technical and complex provisions of the Code.\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT under the U.S. federal income tax laws commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2017. Our qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist. Even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our REIT qualification. New legislation, court decisions or administrative guidance, in each case possibly with retroactive effect, may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a REIT.\nOur qualification as a REIT depends on our ongoing satisfaction of certain gross asset, gross income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements:\n\u2022Our compliance depends upon the characterization of our assets and income for REIT purposes, as well as the relative values of our assets, some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we typically do not obtain independent appraisals. Moreover, we invest in certain assets with respect to which the rules applicable to REITs may be particularly difficult to interpret or to apply, including certain of our target digital infrastructure and real estate assets. If the IRS challenged our treatment investments for purposes of the REIT asset and income tests, and if such a challenge were sustained, we could fail to qualify as a REIT.\n\u2022The fact that we own direct or indirect interests in several REITs, each a Subsidiary REIT, further complicates the application of the REIT requirements for us. Each Subsidiary REIT is subject to the various REIT qualification requirements that are applicable to us and certain other requirements. If a Subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, then (i) that Subsidiary REIT would become subject to regular U.S. federal corporate income tax, (ii) our interest in such Subsidiary REIT would cease to be a qualifying asset for purposes of the REIT asset tests, and (iii) it is possible that we would fail certain of the REIT asset tests, in which event we also would fail to qualify as a REIT unless we could avail ourselves of relief provisions.\nIf we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our taxable income at the regular corporate rate, and dividends paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income. Any resulting corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders, which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of our class A Common Stock. In addition, we would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders. Unless we were entitled to relief under certain Code provisions, we also would be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a REIT.\nComplying with REIT requirements may force us to forgo and/or liquidate otherwise attractive investment opportunities.\nTo qualify as a REIT, we must ensure that we meet the REIT gross income tests annually and that at the end of each calendar quarter, at least 75% of the value of our assets consists of cash, cash items, government securities and qualified REIT real estate assets. Compliance with these limitations, particularly given the nature of some of our digital and other investments (including international investments and certain hedging transactions), may hinder our ability to acquire, optimally finance, or maintain ownership of otherwise attractive investments. To maintain or REIT qualification we could sell be required to sell assets more quickly and on less favorable terms than in a sale not required for REIT qualification.\nOur ownership of assets and conduct of operations through our TRSs is limited and involves certain risks for us.\nConsistent with the REIT qualification requirements, we acquire and own significant assets through our TRSs, including our investment management business. Our TRSs generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax, and/or applicable foreign, state and local tax. Only their after-tax net income is available for distribution to us and our stockholders. The REIT rules limit our use of TRSs, including as follows:\n\u2022No more than 20% of the value of our gross assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRSs and no more than 25% of our gross income can consist of dividend, non-mortgage interest income, or gain from our TRSs securities.\n\u2022A 100% excise tax applies to certain amounts related to transactions involving a TRS and its parent REIT that are not priced on an arm\u2019s-length basis.\n\u2022Our leases of hotel and healthcare property leases with our TRSs must be respected as true leases for U.S. federal income tax purposes and must not be treated as service contracts, joint ventures or some other type of arrangement in order for us to qualify as a REIT and our TRSs must not directly or indirectly operate hotels or healthcare property.\nWe are mindful of these limitations and analyze and structure the income and operations of our TRSs to mitigate these costs and risks to us to the extent practicable, but we may not always be successful in all cases.\nThe ability of our board of directors to revoke our REIT election without stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders.\nOur Charter provides that the board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our REIT election, without the approval of our stockholders, if the board determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a REIT. If we cease to qualify as a REIT, we would become subject to U.S. federal income tax on our net taxable income and we generally would no longer be required to distribute any of our net taxable income to our stockholders, which could adversely affect the attractiveness and value of our Common Stock.\nThere is a risk of changes in the tax law applicable to REITs.\nThe IRS, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review U.S. federal income tax legislation, regulations and other guidance. We cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new U.S. federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted. Any legislative action may prospectively or retroactively modify our tax treatment and, therefore, may adversely affect our taxation or our stockholders. We urge you to consult with your tax advisor with respect to the status of legislative, regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our stock. Although REITs generally receive certain tax advantages compared to entities taxed as non-REIT \u201cC\u201d corporations, it is possible that future legislation would result in a REIT having fewer tax advantages, and it could become more advantageous for us to elect to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a non-REIT \u201cC\u201d corporation.\nThe REIT distribution requirements apply only if we have taxable income and, if we are required to make distributions, we will have less cash available to execute our business plan.\nWe generally must distribute annually at least 90% of our \u201cREIT taxable income\u201d (subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain) in order to qualify as a REIT, and any REIT taxable income that we do not distribute will be subject to U.S. corporate income tax at regular rates. If we do not have REIT taxable income or to the extent we utilize loss carryovers from prior years to reduce REIT taxable income, we will not be required to make distributions to shareholders.\nWe may generate taxable income greater than our income for financial reporting purposes prepared in accordance with GAAP, or differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash may occur. As a result of both the requirement to distribute 90% of our REIT taxable income each year (and to pay tax on any REIT taxable income that we do not distribute) and the fact that our taxable income could exceed our cash income, we may find it difficult to meet the REIT distribution requirements in certain circumstances while also having adequate cash resources to execute our business plan. In particular, where we experience differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash, the requirement to distribute a substantial portion of our taxable income could cause us to: (i) sell assets in adverse market conditions, (ii) borrow on unfavorable terms, or (iii) distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions, capital expenditures or repayment of debt in order to comply with REIT requirements. These alternatives could increase our costs, reduce our equity, and/or result in stockholders being taxed on distributions of shares of stock without receiving cash sufficient to pay the resulting taxes. Thus, compliance with the REIT distribution requirements may hinder our ability to grow, which could adversely affect the value of our Common Stock.\nDividends payable by REITs do not qualify for the preferential tax rates available for some dividends.\nThe maximum U.S. federal income tax rate applicable to \"qualified dividend income\" paid by non-REIT \"C\" corporations to U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally is 20%, whereas ordinary income dividends payable by REITs to those U.S. stockholders generally are not eligible for the 20% rate. Although the reduced rates applicable to dividend income from non-REIT \"C\" corporations do not adversely affect the taxation of REITs or dividends payable by REITs, it could cause investors who are non-corporate taxpayers to perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the shares of non-REIT \"C\" corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of our Common Stock.\nWe might elect to distribute our common stock in a taxable distribution in order to satisfy the REIT distribution requirements, in which case stockholders may sell shares of our common stock to pay tax on such distributions, placing downward pressure on the market price of our common stock.\nTo make required REIT distributions and preserve cash, we might elect to make taxable distributions that are payable partly in cash and partly in shares of our common stock. If we made a taxable dividend payable in cash and shares of our common stock, taxable stockholders receiving such distributions will be taxed on the full amount of the distribution that otherwise would be a dividend for tax purposes, even though part is paid in stock. If we made a taxable dividend payable in cash and our common stock and a significant number of stockholders determine to sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends, it may put downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock.\nEven if we continue to qualify as a REIT, we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash available for distribution to stockholders.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal and state income tax (and any applicable non-U.S. taxes) on the net income earned by our TRSs. Our TRSs generally are expected to have material assets and income. In addition, we have substantial operations and assets outside of the U.S. that are subject to tax in those countries, which are not likely to generate an offsetting credit for taxes in the U.S. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income and assets, including taxes on any undistributed income, tax on income from assets or activities that we undertake after foreclosing on our tenants or borrowers, and state or local income, property and transfer taxes, such as mortgage recording taxes. In addition, if we have net income from \u201cprohibited transactions,\u201d that\nincome will be subject to a 100% tax. In general, \u201cprohibited transactions\u201d are sales or other dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. Finally, we could, in certain circumstances, be required to pay an excise or penalty tax (which could be significant in amount) in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Code to maintain our qualification as a REIT. Any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders.\nOur ability to use our tax benefits could be substantially limited if we experience an \u201cownership change\u201d\nOur net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards and certain recognized built-in losses may be limited by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code if we experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d In general, an \u201cownership change\u201d occurs if 5% shareholders increase their collective ownership of the aggregate amount of the outstanding shares of our company by more than 50 percentage points looking back over the relevant testing period. If an ownership change occurs, our ability to use our NOLs and certain recognized built-in losses to reduce our REIT distribution requirements or taxable income in a future year would be limited to a Section 382 limitation equal to the fair market value of our stock immediately prior to the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt interest rate in effect for the month of the ownership change. The determination of whether an ownership change has occurred or will occur is complicated and depends on changes in percentage stock ownership among shareholders. Therefore, no assurance can be provided as to whether an ownership change has occurred or will occur in the future\nWe will be subject to corporate income tax on the sale of assets acquired from or previously held by a non-REIT \u201cC\u201d corporation within five years of our acquisition of those assets or our becoming a REIT.\nIf a REIT previously was a non-REIT \u201cC\u201d corporation, or it acquires any asset from a non-REIT \u201cC\u201d corporation, or a corporation that generally is subject to full corporate-level tax, in a merger or other transaction in which it acquires a basis in the asset that is determined by reference either to the non-REIT \u201cC\u201d corporation\u2019s basis in the asset or to another asset, the REIT generally will pay tax at the highest regular corporate rate applicable if it recognizes gain on the sale or disposition of the asset during the five-year period after it becomes a REIT or it acquires the asset. Built-in gain on assets held by NSAM as of January 1, 2017, remain subject to this REIT-level tax through the end of 2021.\nWe may incur adverse tax consequences if Colony or NRF were to have failed to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes prior to the Mergers.\nIn connection with the closing of the Mergers, we received an opinion of counsel to each of Colony and NRF to the effect that it qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Code through the time of the Mergers. Neither Colony nor NRF, however, requested a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d) that it qualified as a REIT. If, notwithstanding these opinions, Colony\u2019s or NRF\u2019s REIT status for periods prior to the Mergers were successfully challenged, we would face serious adverse tax consequences (ranging from corporate tax liability to loss of REIT status for past and future years) that would substantially reduce our Core FFO, including cash available to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nWe could be subject to increased taxes if the tax authorities in various international jurisdictions were to modify tax rules and regulations on which we have relied in structuring our international investments.\nWe currently receive favorable tax treatment in various international jurisdictions through tax rules, regulations, tax authority rulings, and international tax treaties. Should changes occur to these rules, regulations, rulings or treaties, we may no longer receive such benefits, and consequently, the amount of taxes we pay with respect to our international investments may increase.", "PERMNO": 14686, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "CLNY"}
