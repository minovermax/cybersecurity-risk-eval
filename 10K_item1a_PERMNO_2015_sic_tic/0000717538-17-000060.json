{"cik": "717538", "company": "ARROW FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur financial results and the market price of our stock are subject to risks arising from many factors, including the risks listed below, as well as other risks and uncertainties. Any of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. (Please note that the discussion below regarding the potential impact on Arrow of certain of these factors that may develop in the future is not meant to provide predictions by Arrow's management that such factors will develop, but to acknowledge the possible negative consequences to our company and business if certain conditions develop.)\nDifficult market conditions continue to present significant challenges to the profitability of the U.S. commercial banking industry and its core business of making and servicing loans and any substantial downturn in the U.S. economy generally could adversely affect our ability to maintain steady growth in our loan portfolio and our earnings. Many existing or potential loan customers of commercial banks, especially individuals and small businesses, continue to experience financial and budgetary pressures that both challenge their ability to service their existing indebtedness and sharply restrict their ability or willingness to incur additional indebtedness. The demand for loans has generally increased in recent years, and very low prevailing rates of interest for all types of credit still exist, which makes borrowing more affordable and attractive to customers of all types. However, while the U.S. economy and our regional economy have shown signs of improvement in recent years, consumers and small businesses are still struggling under heavy debt loads, which will continue to weigh against any surge in growth or profitability in the banking sector. This cautionary scenario confronts us as it confronts all commercial banks, large and small, and could adversely affect our ability to originate loans.\nWe face continuing and growing security risks to our information base including the information we maintain relating to our customers, and any breaches in the security systems we have implemented to protect this information could have a material negative effect on our business operations and financial condition. In the ordinary course of business, Arrow relies on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to store sensitive data. Arrow employs an in-depth, layered, defensive approach that leverages people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. Arrow employs a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to report on any suspected advanced persistent threats. We have implemented and regularly review and update extensive systems of internal controls and procedures as well as corporate governance policies and procedures intended to protect our business operations, including the security and privacy of all confidential customer information. In addition, we rely on the services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs. No matter how well designed or implemented our controls are, we cannot provide an absolute guarantee to protect our business operations from every type of cybersecurity or other security problem in every situation. A failure or circumvention of these controls could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition. Notwithstanding the strength of our defensive measures, the threat from cyber attacks is severe, attacks are sophisticated and increasing in volume, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. While to date, Arrow has not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, our systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers.\nThe computer systems and network infrastructure that we use are always vulnerable to unforeseen disruptions, including theft of confidential customer information (\u201cidentity theft\u201d) and interruption of service as a result of fire, natural disasters, explosion, general infrastructure failure or cyber attacks. These disruptions may arise in our internally developed systems, or the systems of our third-party service providers or may originate from the actions of our consumer and business customers who access our systems from their own networks or digital devices to process transactions. Information security and cyber security risks have increased significantly in recent years because of consumer demand to use the Internet and other electronic delivery channels to conduct financial transactions. Cybersecurity risk is a major concern to financial services regulators and all financial service providers, including our company. These risks are further exacerbated due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists and other disreputable parties. We regularly assess and test our security systems and disaster preparedness, including back-up systems, but the risks are substantially escalating. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued enhancement of our controls and processes to protect our systems, data and networks from attacks or unauthorized access remain a priority. Accordingly, we may be required to expend additional resources to enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or exposures. Any breach of our system security could result in disruption of our operations, unauthorized access to confidential customer information, significant regulatory costs, litigation exposure and other possible damages, loss or liability. Such costs or losses could exceed the amount of available insurance coverage, if any, and would adversely affect our earnings. Also, any failure to prevent a security breach or to quickly and effectively deal with such a breach could negatively impact customer confidence, damaging our reputation and undermining our ability to attract and keep customers. In addition, if we fail to observe any of the cybersecurity requirements in federal or state laws, regulations or regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various sanctions, including financial penalties.\nThe quality of our bank loan portfolio remains strong but could erode somewhat if the U.S. economy or our regional economy experiences even a modest downturn; any such erosion could have an adverse impact on our financial condition. Home prices in all regions of the U.S., including our market area in northeastern New York, have stabilized or even strengthened somewhat in recent periods. Delinquency and charge-off rates in our loan portfolio remain very low. However, we like most banks continue to have substantial exposure in our portfolio to borrowers, particularly individual and small business borrowers, who if confronted by an economic downturn of any consequence, including one that results in their loss of their job or the failure of their\n# 13\nbusiness, may quickly fall in arrears on their borrowings including on our loans to them. We believe not only that the quality of our loan portfolio is strong but also that our allowance is entirely adequate to cover all embedded risk. However, any downturn of consequence in the economy, nationwide or in our region, would likely require increased provisions to our allowance, potentially damaging our financial condition and results.\nPersistent volatility in the U.S. equity markets, coupled with economic instability and uncertainty, has an adverse effect on the core business of the U.S. commercial banking sector which could adversely impact our financial results. The U.S. financial sector, particularly that portion that is focused on the equity markets (i.e., \u201cWall Street\u201d), has largely recovered from the 2008-2009 financial crisis, although periods of enhanced volatility continue to surface-. At the same time, the wider U.S. economy, especially the business sector that underlies the day-to-day health of U.S. commercial banks (\u201cMain Street\u201d), continues to experience only very modest growth. In some areas of the U.S. and some sectors of the U.S. economy. companies, workers and municipalities have not returned to the levels of financial health they enjoyed before the 2008-2009 crisis. Commercial banks like ours are much more closely tied, in terms of growth and profits, to the Main Street sector than the Wall Street sector. Accordingly, our financial results and condition may continue to be pressured by the modest and uneven growth that continues to characterize the U.S. economy generally and our regional economy as well.\nAny future economic or financial downturn, including any significant correction in the equity markets, may negatively affect the volume of income attributable to, and demand for, fee-based services of banks such as ours, including our fiduciary business, which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operation. Revenues from our trust and wealth management business are dependent on the level of assets under management. Any significant downturn in the equity markets may lead our trust and wealth management customers to liquidate their investments, or may diminish account values for those customers who elect to leave their portfolios with us, in either case reducing our assets under management and thereby decreasing our revenues from this important sector of our business. Our other fee-based businesses are also susceptible to a sudden economic or financial downturn.\nRulemaking under Dodd-Frank continues to unfold; these and other regulations being promulgated may adversely affect our Company and certain players in the financial industry as a whole. Even before the financial crisis and the resulting new banking laws and regulations, including Dodd-Frank, we were subject to extensive Federal and state banking regulations and supervision. Banking laws and regulations are intended primarily to protect bank depositors\u2019 funds (and indirectly the Federal deposit insurance funds) as well as bank retail customers, who may lack the sophistication to understand or appreciate bank products and services. These laws and regulations generally are not, however, aimed at protecting or enhancing the returns on investment enjoyed by bank shareholders.\nOur depositor/customer awareness of the changing regulatory environment is particularly true of the set of laws and regulations under Dodd-Frank, which were passed in the aftermath of the 2008-2009 financial crisis and in large part were intended to better protect bank customers (and to some degree, banks) against a wide variety of lending products and aggressive lending practices that pre-dated the crisis and are seen as having contributed to its severity. Although not all banks offered such products or engaged in such practices, all banks are affected by the new laws and regulations to some degree.\nDodd-Frank restricts our lending practices, requires us to expend substantial additional resources to safeguard customers, significantly increases our regulatory burden, and subjects us to significantly higher minimum capital requirements which, in the long run, may serve as a drag on our earnings, growth and ultimately on our dividends and stock price (the new capital standards are separately addressed in the following risk factor).\nWhile it is difficult to predict the full extent to which Dodd-Frank and the resulting new regulations and rules may adversely impact our business or financial results, or the extent to which regulations previously adopted under Dodd-Frank or the provisions of Dodd-Frank itself may be rescinded or modified in upcoming periods, as a result of recent political developments,we believe the changes flowing from Dodd-Frank will continue to increase our costs. Furthermore, we also believe that any potential changes to Dodd-Frank will require us to continue to modify certain strategies, business operations and capital and liquidity structures which, individually or collectively, may very well have a material adverse impact on our financial condition.\nRevised capital and liquidity standards adopted by the U.S. banking regulators require banks and bank holding companies to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater liquidity than has historically been the case. Capital standards, particularly those adopted as a result of Dodd-Frank, continue to have a significant effect on banks and bank holding companies, including Arrow. Although many of the remedial measures contained in Dodd-Frank and the regulations promulgated thereunder may be reconsidered at the federal legislative and regulatory levels as a result of the recent U.S. elections and political developments, the revised and enhanced regulatory capital standards adopted by bank regulators in response to the mandates in Dodd-Frank are generally perceived as less likely to be rescinded or relaxed than some of the other restrictive or burdensome changes mandated by Dodd-Frank. Thus, many if perhaps not all of the enhanced bank capital standards promulgated under Dodd-Frank are widely expected to remain in effect, including the capital buffers yet to be fully phased in, forcing bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially higher levels of capital as a percentage of their assets, with a greater emphasis on common equity as opposed to other components of capital. The need to maintain more and higher quality capital, as well as greater liquidity, and generally increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to capital levels, may at some point limit our business activities, including lending, and our ability to expand. It could also result in our being required to take steps to increase our regulatory capital and may dilute shareholder value or limit our ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to our investors through stock repurchases.\n# 14\nIf economic conditions should worsen and the U.S. experiences a recession or prolonged economic stagnation, the quality of our loan portfolio may weaken so significantly that our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual or expected loan losses. Like all financial institutions, we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable loan losses at the balance sheet date. Our allowance for loan losses is based on our historical loss experience as well as an evaluation of the risks associated with our loan portfolio, including the size and composition of the portfolio, current economic conditions and geographic concentrations within the portfolio and other factors. While we have continued to enjoy a very high level of quality in our loan portfolio generally and very low levels of loan charge-offs and non-performing loans, if the economy in our geographic market area should deteriorate to the point that recessionary conditions return, or if the regional or national economy experiences a protracted period of stagnation, the quality of our loan portfolio may weaken so significantly that our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual or expected loan losses. If so, future increases in provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect financial results. Moreover, weak or worsening economic conditions often lead to difficulties in other areas of our business, including growth of our business generally, thereby compounding the negative effects on earnings.\nAlthough rates have begun to rise somewhat, the current interest rate environment, still is not particularly favorable for commercial banks or their core businesses, and any future significant increases in prevailing rates may ultimately have a negative impact on our prospects and performance. Prevailing market interest rates, and changes in those rates, have a direct and material impact on the financial performance and condition of commercial banks. A bank\u2019s net interest income generally comprises the majority of its total income, and changes in prevailing rates for bank assets and bank liabilities significantly affect its net interest income. Currently, market interest rates in the U.S., across all maturities and for all types of loans, although beginning to rise, still remain low. Lending institutions such as commercial banks remain in a very challenging position.\nAfter raising the Fed funds rate by 25 basis points in December 2016, the Fed elected to raise the Fed funds rate again in December 2016, again by 25 basis points. Presumably, short-term interest rates will rise again accordingly. Moreover, the general expectation is that the Fed will proceed with additional rate rises this year and perhaps next year. These increases in market rates, although possibly helpful to banks at least initially as loans reprice upward, may nevertheless be expected ultimately to adversely impact the commercial banking sector in certain respects. If rate rises persist, it may be expected that bank liabilities (deposits) also will reprice upward, pressuring margins once again. Additionally, if rates rise substantially, especially long-term rates, economic growth is likely to be negatively impacted at some point, and the housing sector particularly may suffer significant damage. It was out of concern for the long-run health of the U.S. economy at large that led the Fed to pursue the imposition of a long-term, low-rate environment, and it is to be expected that the Fed will approach further rate increases with great caution and abandon or defer future increases if any weakness in the economy should surface. Whatever the Fed and the other central banks in the developed world elect to do from the standpoint of monetary policy, their decisions will affect the activities, results of operations and profitability of banks and bank holding companies such as Arrow. We cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary and other policies or the effect that they may have on our operations or financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and market areas that could negatively affect our growth and profitability. Competition for commercial banking and other financial services is fierce in our market areas. In one or more aspects of business, our subsidiaries compete with other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, Internet-based financial services companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking companies, and other financial intermediaries. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services, as well as better pricing for those products and services, than we can. Technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. In addition, many of our competitors are not subject to the same extensive Federal regulations that govern bank holding companies and Federally insured banks. Failure to offer competitive services in our market areas could significantly weaken our market position, adversely affecting our growth, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company relies on the operations of our banking subsidiaries to provide liquidity which, if limited, could impact our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders or to repurchase our common stock. We are a bank holding company, a separate legal entity from our subsidiaries. Our bank holding company does not have significant operations of its own. The ability of our subsidiaries, including our bank and insurance subsidiaries, to pay dividends is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of our subsidiaries and other factors, that our subsidiaries might be restricted at some point in their ability to pay dividends to the holding company, including by a bank regulator asserting that the payment of such dividends or other payments would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. In addition, under Dodd-Frank, we are subjected to consolidated capital requirements at the holding company level. If our holding company or its bank subsidiaries are required to retain or increase capital, we may not be able to maintain our cash dividends or pay dividends at all, or to repurchase shares of our common stock.\nIf economic conditions worsen and the U.S. financial markets should suffer a downturn, we may experience limited access to credit markets. As discussed under Part I, Item 7.D. \u201cLiquidity,\u201d we maintain borrowing relationships with various third parties that enable us to obtain from them, on relatively short notice, overnight and longer-term funds sufficient to enable us to fulfill our obligations to customers, including deposit withdrawals. If, in the context of a downturn in the U.S. economy or financial markets, these third parties should encounter difficulty in accessing their own credit markets, we may, in turn, experience a decrease in our capacity to borrow funds from them or other third parties traditionally relied upon by banks for liquidity.\n# 15\nWe are subject to the local economies where we operate, and unfavorable economic conditions in these areas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Much of our success depends upon the growth in business activity, income levels and deposits in our geographic market area. Although our market area has experienced a stabilizing of economic conditions in recent years and even periods of modest growth, if unpredictable or unfavorable economic conditions unique to our market area should occur in upcoming periods, such will likely have an adverse effect on the quality of our loan portfolio and financial performance. As a community bank, we are less able than our larger regional competitors to spread the risk of unfavorable local economic conditions over a larger market area. Moreover, we cannot give any assurances that we, as a single enterprise, will benefit from any unique and favorable economic conditions in our market area, even if they do occur.\nChanges in accounting standards may materially and negatively impact our financial statements. From time-to-time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we may be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in changes to previously reported financial statements. Specifically, changes in the fair value of our financial assets could have a significant negative impact on our asset portfolios and indirectly on our capital levels.\nOur business could suffer if we lose key personnel unexpectedly or if employee wages increase significantly. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain our key personnel for the duration of their expected terms of service. On an ongoing basis, we prepare and review back-up plans, in the event key personnel are unexpectedly rendered incapable of performing or depart or resign from their positions. However, any sudden unexpected change at the senior management level may adversely affect our business. In addition, should our industry begin to experience a shortage of qualified employees, we like other financial institutions may have difficulty attracting and retaining entry level or higher bracket personnel and also may experience, as a result of such shortages or the enactment of higher minimum wage laws locally or nationwide, increased salary expense, which would likely negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure. Third-party vendors provide key components of our business infrastructure such as Internet connections, network access and mutual fund distribution. The financial health and operational capabilities of these third parties are for the most part beyond our control, and any problems experienced by these third parties, such that they may not be able to continue to provide services to us or to perform such services consistent with our expectations, could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and to conduct our business.\nProblems encountered by other financial institutions could adversely affect us. Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by financial or commercial problems confronting other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to many different counterparties in the normal course of business, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, other commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other financial institutions. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by us or by other financial institutions on whom we rely or with whom we interact. Some of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be liquidated or only may be liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount due us under the underlying financial instrument held by us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur industry is faced with technological advances and changes on a continuing basis, and failure to adapt to these advances and changes could have a material adverse impact on our business. Technological advances and changes in the financial services industry are pervasive and constant factors. The retail financial services sector, like many other retail goods and services sectors, is currently in the throes of revolutionary change, involving new delivery and communications systems and technologies that are extraordinarily far-reaching and impactful. For us to remain competitive, we must comprehend and adapt to these systems and technologies . Proper implementation of new technologies can increase efficiency, decrease costs and help to meet customer demand. However, many of our competitors have greater resources to invest in technological advances and changes. We may not always be successful in utilizing the latest technological advances in offering our products and services or in otherwise conducting our business. Failure to identify, consider, adapt to and implement technological advances and changes could have a material adverse effect on our business.", "PERMNO": 15070, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "AROW"}
